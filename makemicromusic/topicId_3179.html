Then you can tweak the settings and try redo all<br/>(or redo a particular one or highlight a selection to<br/>redo).</p><p>Some would be easier than others. It is a little easier<br/>than finding the pitch of a sound with no other information<br/>given - you can set a tolerance of e.g 10 cents or whatever<br/>and then if the pitch found is more than that distance<br/>from the expected one, it won&apos;t retune it, and<br/>say so in the report.</p><p>Then one could redo those, e.g. with option to look for<br/>a FFT partial or wave count for a note an octave above<br/>the expected pitch (or below possibly).</p><p>Robert</p></div>
