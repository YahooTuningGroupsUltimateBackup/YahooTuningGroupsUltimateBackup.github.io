I don&apos;t like the interfaces where you have *no* idea what is happening, just waiting; I prefer to upload/download with an ftp client, but can&apos;t with Yahoo.</p><p>I tried putting up a temp site at Tripod last night, based on a good review from CNet, but even there it is *slow*. I can ftp, but it was going to take over an hour for my 11.8 meg file to upload, and I don&apos;t know if that is really the way to go. I&apos;ll try late tonight when I don&apos;t have to do other stuff. Boy, I sure wish I had DSL or cable...</p><p>I&apos;ll keep you posted. For now I&apos;ve got that gamelan piece up, and maybe will just do snippets of pieces for the near-future.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon (who will still try some pieces at t-challenge...)</p></div>
