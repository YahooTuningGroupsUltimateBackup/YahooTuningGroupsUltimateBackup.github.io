A thirdtone system in 14<br/>notes rather than 17 with three varieties of thirds or sixths; an<br/>outstanding major third to which Brian McLaren rightly called my<br/>attention; and fine 86-cent semitones of the kind that a string player<br/>(bowed European violin or plucked Japanese koto) could love even<br/>without my specifically medievalist inclinations regarding vertical<br/>cadences and the like.</p><p>With 14-tET, as people might guess, I was confronted with a<br/>precompositional or pre-improvisational &quot;performance practice&quot;:<br/>choosing a timbre to make those 8/14 octave fifths (~686 cents) and<br/>6/14 octave fourths (~514 cents) the &quot;perfect concords&quot; which my<br/>musical style calls for.</p><p>My quick solution that first night (Monday) was a preset timbre on the<br/>Yahama TX-802 called &quot;Puff Pipes&quot; (A56); I also tried a Marimba voice<br/>for more of a gamelan texture, which could be neat with a beautiful<br/>pelog that 14-tET supports (more below). This let me start my<br/>exploration at a point where things were &quot;smooth enough for the<br/>moment,&quot; although I might look forward to play around in quest of a<br/>bit more smoothness and resonance.</p><p>My slightly more customized but still rather &quot;crude&quot; solution the next<br/>day was to take a timbre I had set up for 13-tET, and adjust the<br/>settings of partials for the 14-tET fifth or twelfth (a ratio of about<br/>2.97 for the twelfth in comparison to 3.00 for a pure twelfth).</p><p>This got to things to a nice point: a certain resonant quality to<br/>those fifths and twelfths, maybe especially when the octave helped out<br/>in a complete trine (a 2:3:4 sonority, with the fifth below the<br/>fourth, or 0-8-14 steps in 14-tET). However, even with the &quot;off the<br/>shelf&quot; Puff Pipes the first night, things were quite tolerable: while<br/>comparisons are difficult, I&apos;d say it was possibly comparable to<br/>meantone fifths in a bright timbre.</p><p>Of course, getting the stable concords is just the beginning of the<br/>story, a kind of prerequisite preparation: there are all those juicy<br/>imperfect concords, and I was ready to try them!</p><p>By the way, Aaron and others, the timbre factor is the one reason that<br/>I&apos;m using ASCII notation rather than MIDI files, specifying the notes<br/>and cautioning that this is highly timbre-sensitive. A tape or CD or<br/>audio soundfile, of course, is the best documentation.</p><p>To start out, one of the first things I did in 14-tET, not<br/>unpredictably, was to try this cadence:</p><p>           21  22<br/>           13  14<br/>           2   0</p><p>It was beautiful, and very familiar: a major sixth (11 steps, 2-13)<br/>expanding to an octave (0-14), and a major tenth (19 steps, 2-21)<br/>expanding to a twelfth (0-22). My reaction: &quot;This could be Notre Dame<br/>Cathedral in 1350&quot;: it sounds fitting, classic, and _right_!</p><p>By this way, this style of notation takes the lowest note of the<br/>resolving interval or chord as step &quot;0&quot;; it shows the pitches in a<br/>straightforward manner, at least, and spares the reader some<br/>entanglement in my curious keyboard mapping.</p><p>Well, it seems that a distinctly &quot;xenharmonic&quot; temperament like 14-tET<br/>can tune some basic intervals harmoniously (with a conducive timbre,<br/>of course, a qualification applying to many musical situations to one<br/>degree or another) and bring off a standard cadence. While the<br/>428-cent major third is within a &quot;standard&quot; range, and quite superb,<br/>the 942-cent major sixth might be considered a bit wider than the run<br/>of the mill -- but the intervals fit together flawlessly.</p><p>Now for an experiment I&apos;ve been waiting to try, something I guess<br/>will delight me, but wonder just how it will sound:</p><p>        10   8<br/>         7   8<br/>         2   0<br/>        -1   0</p><p>This is a gorgeous &quot;minor seventh quad,&quot; as I call it, with the outer<br/>minor seventh (11 steps) contracting to a stable fifth, and those<br/>minor thirds (3 steps) contracting to unisons, while the middle major<br/>third (5 steps) expands to a fifth: it&apos;s warm, suave, and sweet, just<br/>as in a JI tuning like my Sesquisexta (where that seventh sonority is<br/>a pure 12:14:18:21), or a more conventional temperament like HTT-29,<br/>Peppermint, or 17-WT.</p><p>How cozy and familiar and homelike this feels -- that&apos;s my main<br/>artistic judgment. It is an enjoyment of shear beauty joined to<br/>analytical wonder: this hospitable sonority has as its minor seventh<br/>the same 11-step interval that provided the charmingly expansive major<br/>sixth of my previous example. As I had guessed, that 943-cent interval<br/>could most happily fit both roles. In a JI system like Sesquisexta,<br/>we&apos;d use two separate intervals: a 12:7 major sixth around 933 cents,<br/>and a 7:4 minor seventh around 969 cents, with values near these in<br/>tempered systems seeking closely to emulate this kind of JI.</p><p>A bit of further experimenting confirmed that the 11-step interval<br/>tends to take on the color of either a major sixth or minor seventh,<br/>depending on the intervals with which it is associated in a given<br/>sonority or progression. I&apos;ll give more examples in my next report.</p><p>In the meantone -- or meantime, a &quot;slip of the keyboard&quot; I&apos;ve made an<br/>idiom of sorts -- thank you, Aaron, for your welcome, and I&apos;m looking<br/>forward to lots of compositional/improvisational dialogue.</p><p>Oh, yes -- here&apos;s that pelog, as promised, actually two variations:</p><p>                  0   1      6     8   9       14<br/>                  0  86     514   686 771     1200<br/>                    1    5      2    1     5<br/>                    86  429    171   86   429</p><p>                                or</p><p>                  0   1    3       8   9       14<br/>                  0  86   257     686 771     1200<br/>                    1   2      5     1     5<br/>                    86 171    429    86   429</p><p>In conventional notation we might write E-F-A-B-C-E and E-F-G-B-C-E,<br/>respectively, and that happens to be my keyboard mapping; they&apos;re<br/>beautiful scales.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=6406 href="#6406">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2004 2:10:19 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; forward to lots of compositional/improvisational dialogue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh, yes -- here&apos;s that pelog, as promised, actually two variations:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                   0   1      6     8   9       14<br/>&gt;                   0  86     514   686 771     1200<br/>&gt;                     1    5      2    1     5<br/>&gt;                     86  429    171   86   429<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                                 or<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                   0   1    3       8   9       14<br/>&gt;                   0  86   257     686 771     1200<br/>&gt;                     1   2      5     1     5<br/>&gt;                     86 171    429    86   429<br/>&gt;<br/>Margo:</p><p>You might consider calling the first tuning a &quot;sorog&quot; and the second &quot;degung&quot;, as they are both closer to these Sundanese tunings than to pelogs, for which I find the 86 cent interval to be too small for the isolated two note segment of the scale.</p><p>Best regards</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=6408 href="#6408">ðŸ”—</a>kraig grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/30/2004 7:47:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello Daniel.<br/>     Could you possibly expand upon the differences between the Pelog on<br/>one side and Sorog and Degung on the other if possible.</p><p>Daniel Wolf wrote:</p><p>&gt; Margo Schulter wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; forward to lots of compositional/improvisational dialogue.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh, yes -- here&apos;s that pelog, as promised, actually two variations:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;                   0   1      6     8   9       14<br/>&gt; &gt;                   0  86     514   686 771     1200<br/>&gt; &gt;                     1    5      2    1     5<br/>&gt; &gt;                     86  429    171   86   429<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;                                 or<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;                   0   1    3       8   9       14<br/>&gt; &gt;                   0  86   257     686 771     1200<br/>&gt; &gt;                     1   2      5     1     5<br/>&gt; &gt;                     86 171    429    86   429<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Margo:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You might consider calling the first tuning a &quot;sorog&quot; and the second<br/>&gt; &quot;degung&quot;, as they are both closer to these Sundanese tunings than to<br/>&gt; pelogs, for which I find the 86 cent interval to be too small for the<br/>&gt; isolated two note segment of the scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Best regards<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Wolf<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [MMM info]------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; More MMM music files are at <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music.html">http://www.microtonal.org/music.html</a><br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

I think this applies less well<br/>here as<br/>&gt; &gt; the fifths are narrow, but, and strictly off the top of my head,<br/>it<br/>&gt; &gt; might work if you built a slendro out of  28tet, e.g. 0-5-11-17-<br/>22-28 or<br/>&gt; &gt; 0-5-10-17-22-28.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  interesting how these two go from<br/>&gt;  S L S L L<br/>&gt; S S L S L<br/>&gt; By changing only a single tone<br/>&gt;  Thanks this is helpful</p><p>I&apos;m confused, Kraig . . . if I take s=5, M=6, L=7 it looks to me like<br/>the first one is</p><p>s M M s M</p><p>while the second one is</p><p>s s L s M</p><p>. . .
