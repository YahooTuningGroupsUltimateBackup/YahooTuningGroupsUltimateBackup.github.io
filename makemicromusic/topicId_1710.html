Need to spend more time doing more &quot;original&quot; voices,<br/>though.  When I first started doing electronic music in MIDI several<br/>years ago, I would only use a sound if I had totally invented it from<br/>scratch...  a bit fanatical.  But that was before I was trying to<br/>concentrate on *tunings!*</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve been thinking of moving toward software synthesis (with<br/>&gt; Infinity) but my machine is too slow...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rick - I&apos;m also hugely interested in Infinity - but - and BIG BUT -<br/>&gt; can we affrim that this thing can allow one to design synths which<br/>&gt; have full retuning capabilites???<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; We gots to know! Have you researched it???<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As one would expect - they say *Nothing* about it one there web<br/>site!</p><p>****They &quot;claim&quot; it can somehow do this.  However, I am finding<br/>_Infinity_ a totally non-intuitive product.  In fact, Sound Quest<br/>didn&apos;t even bother to consolidate the two manuals, one from the<br/>earlier version of the product, and one from the later.  Cheap.  And<br/>it&apos;s fairly expensive for what it does.</p><p>It&apos;s totally modular, which means it&apos;s best suited for a *sound<br/>designer* who really knows sound engineering and can work with the<br/>components from experience.  I sure isn&apos;t in the manuals, and I&apos;ve<br/>read them at least *three* times!</p><p>I think even CSOUND would be easier to get to do stuff... at least<br/>that&apos;s my impression, but I&apos;ve had trouble with even that, so maybe<br/>don&apos;t go by me!   :)</p><p>J.
