Duh... Actually, now my foggy memory reminds me<br/>that I actually *tried* these some time back with Sound Forge for<br/>effects... but I didn&apos;t have the fully professional version so they<br/>weren&apos;t supported and I also crashed something... I don&apos;t remember if<br/>it was Cool Edit or something else...  I didn&apos;t realize the impact<br/>they would have with softsynths, though, but softsynths were not<br/>quite as common then... a year or two ago...</p><p>I wonder what the acronym &quot;VST&quot; means... unless it has something to<br/>do with Steinberg...?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=4204 href="#4204">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
