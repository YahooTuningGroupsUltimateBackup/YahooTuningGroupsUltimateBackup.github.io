Bear in mind the original source was from a MiniDisc recording as well!</p><p>Somewhere in the cabinet with all my LPs is one of my all-time favorite electronic/tape recordings, the old Xenakis Nonesuch disc with &quot;Bohur&quot; (IIRC). I don&apos;t remember the names of both pieces, but one was a tape manipulation piece all based on the sound of a metal bracelet, and the other was based on recordings of the sound of charcoal crackling as it cooled. The amount of hours and work, literally with razor blades and splicing tape, was ridiculous, but those pieces are gorgeous. And amazing how pretty much anyone can do that, and far, far more, on the average desktop PC.</p><p>&gt;maybe you could subtitle it &quot;Threnody (for the victims of the Secret &gt;Government: from 9/11 to Baghdad)&quot;.</p><p>Well, we didn&apos;t want to take ourselves too seriously!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Alison Monteith &#x3C;alison.monteith3@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/4/2003 2:22:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>on 3/8/03 8:25, Jonathan M.

The laptops in particular have excellent specs,<br/>&gt;large screens, fully configured, excellent support, etc. Prices are very<br/>&gt;attractive. .</p><p>That is good news, esp if the laptop is reasonable. I tell you: if price<br/>were no object, I would have gone out and gotten the highest-end Apple<br/>portable right now. I just last night saw a production of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;<br/>at the Old Globe here in town; I had done the percussion work on the<br/>original recording session with a wonderful composer/sound designer from<br/>New York, Dan Moses Schrier. He came over to discuss &apos;sounds&apos; and demoed<br/>stuff on his Powerbook, and said it contained all the tools he needed for<br/>most of his work. Good thing: when we saw the show we found that the<br/>director (I assume) had changed direction somewhat, or didn&apos;t like the<br/>initial sessions (which included wind/brass instruments), and went with a<br/>score that was almost entirely metal percussion, found sound and<br/>processing. What Dan was able to come up with, using a portable platform<br/>(at this point I am *assuming*) was extraordinary - great, deep sound<br/>worlds (microtonal in patches, but as a side issue). The tools for solid<br/>work are in small silver boxes.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t know about soundcards as such for laptops, only the USB or<br/>&gt;Firewire options. M-Audio have just released a Firewire interface, the<br/>&gt;410, for just over &pound;300.00. Should see off any latency problems.</p><p>Firewire audio is still pretty new, but should be the way to go for speed.<br/>I&apos;m willing to bet that if a company with a solid track record in audio<br/>cards comes out with a Fire card it would be worth investigating.<br/>Naturally, the drivers are important too.</p><p>&gt;I look forward to reading the results your evaluations. The most<br/>&gt;favourable reports on microtunable softsynths I&apos;ve read have come from<br/>&gt;Rhino, z3ta and FM7 users.

Bear in mind that I&apos;ll try to be fair on the<br/>microtuning side, but when it comes to sounds and the ... &apos;feel&apos; of a<br/>softie, it will inevitably reflect some of my personal tastes. Rick McGowan<br/>has had a lot of success with Rhino, but I also know that Rick comes from a<br/>long FM background; I, on the other hand, was a big analog man and only<br/>took on FM when I needed to buy a TX box to get more microtonality. I never<br/>did like programming FM patches, and honestly still don&apos;t. But Rhino and<br/>FM7 are far more flexible than the older hardware boxes.</p><p>And why, in my mind&apos;s eye, do I picture you being arty with no problem<br/>whatsoever?</p><p>:)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S.
