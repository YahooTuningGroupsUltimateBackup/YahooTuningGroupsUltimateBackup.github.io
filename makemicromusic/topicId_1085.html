Can you spell &quot;blecch&quot;? ;-)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; For 20 bucks a month, I recommend Laughing Squid web hosting to solve<br/>&gt; &gt; our<br/>&gt; &gt; data storage and mail list needs.  I have my web page hosted at<br/>&gt; &gt; Laughing<br/>&gt; &gt; Squid; they&apos;re personable and cater exclusively to starving artists.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And to start off, I&apos;ll donate twenty bucks into the annual kitty, if<br/>&gt; &gt; someone wants to take up the gauntlet and make a simple MMM site<br/>&gt; &gt; without<br/>&gt; &gt; crappy ads and annoying pop-ups.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Check out <a href="http://www.laughingsquid.org">http://www.laughingsquid.org</a> for details.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;       Rick<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I mentioned the pop-ups a while back whwn they blocked out one of<br/>&gt; Graham&apos;s messages.

But it seems like<br/>&gt;it might be somewhat problematic having everyone chip in with whatever<br/>&gt;fraction the share would be. But maybe LaughingSquid will accept<br/>&gt;yearly payments.</p><p>Yeah, at Laughing Squid you can pay a year up front; gets cheaper that<br/>way.  They also have a &quot;starving artist&quot; program for $15/month if you&apos;re<br/>willing to fly their logo on your home page.  Having people pay some<br/>fraction just gets complicated.  Best to try getting enough  people to<br/>&quot;pledge&quot; some amount for the first year and form a collective.  I&apos;d rather<br/>not actually run such a website myself, but as I said, I&apos;ll thrown in some<br/>cash to get it rolling, if someone wants to pick up the ball.  I&apos;ll even go<br/>double and thrown in forty bucks for the first year.  (I just get so damn<br/>sick of the advertising and hassles...)</p><p>Oh, I just checked and Laughing Squid actually doesn&apos;t have good mail list<br/>support; but they do forwarding, and have a few e-mail accounts; but they<br/>can&apos;t run a list.  But it&apos;s a place to hang files, if anyone&apos;s into that.</p><p>As of this moment, &quot;<a href="http://MicrotonalCollective.org">MicrotonalCollective.org</a>&quot; is available.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
