(1.17 or 1.16)</p><p>regardless it is not nice that they lied about the resolution of E!<br/>card&apos;s microtonal definition. there was much less accuracy than the<br/>quarter cent which they claimed. although i confess that the 1.5 cent<br/>accuracy served me well enough. i suspect some of the preciseness gets<br/>lost by the complexity of timbre.</p><p>i will try to find this article in the archives.</p><p>thanks again!</p><p>miko</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jose Antonio Martin Salinas<br/>&lt;jamsalinas@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Miko,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There was a fully detailed message on the Tuning List 5 years ago,<br/>or more, providing full details about the tuning definition.
