I was contacted by the owner of this site asking<br/>permission to use my picture and pictures of the StarrBoard and other<br/>instruments. He has a nice collection of instruments and builders<br/>featured, but is missing many others. I already suggested Darreg and<br/>Partch, so I suspect they will be up soon.</p><p>If you build instruments you should contact him. He had my stuff on<br/>there about an hour after I gave him permission.</p><p><a href="http://noisejunk.eu/index.php?page=builders">http://noisejunk.eu/index.php?page=builders</a></p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3><a id=18568 href="#18568">ðŸ”—</a>Michael Sheiman &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/23/2008 1:48:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>If the any software/synthesizer package any of you know of that will dynamically change the timbre of an instrument to calculate the clearest possible timbre for any given scale (including non equally tempered scale) and change to it/calculate it differently for each note in the scale according to whatever scale you give it</p><p>   The good news is I have managed to come up with a 12 note scale able to be played harmonically with about 10/12 being consistently in tune with each other (IE overtones are within about 8-cents of overlap with each other).<br/>   The bad news is about two notes seem off/&quot;wolf-ish&quot; and I am hoping to find a way to get them sounding consonant so hopefully they will be adopted for use on traditional looking keyboards and synthesizers.</p><p>  All my work, including this special tuning (song title called 12MT or &quot;modulated temperament&quot;) and one song written in harmonized 8-note subset scales of 19TET called &quot;Melancholy in Yellow&quot;...is on <a href="http://Traxinspace.com">Traxinspace.com</a> under the artist name &quot;Spectra&quot;.</p><p>   And, no I don&apos;t get paid a dime for my free work on that site...nor would I really care if I did.<br/>    Moreover, I am  simply very eager to find a micro-tonal scale that is both consonant enough to be commercially viable and also providing enough tonal freedom to allow the more diverse melodic progressions and moods possible in micro-tonal and exotic scales such as 22TET.  So we I could appreciate a wider world of possibilities in moods we hear in, say, songs on the radio or at major concerts and live venues.  And I would, of course, appreciate any help in making that happen. :-)</p><p>...With all the expressive technology we have nowadays, it&apos;s a miracle 95% of the world still uses variations of the same old tuning they&apos;ve been using since the 1400&apos;s. :-D</p><p>---------------------------------<br/>Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
