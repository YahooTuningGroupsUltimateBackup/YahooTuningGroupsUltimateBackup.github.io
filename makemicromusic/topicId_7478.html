I think<br/>piano music is one of the hardest things for me to be happy writing;<br/>in other words feeling like I have something meaningful to say with<br/>it in my own way. As it turns out the Sovittaja Park Preludes wound<br/>up being some of my favorite pieces that I&apos;ve written, but I&apos;m not so<br/>sure how their sparse textures and subtle, personal language will<br/>translate in an mp3 format... so with that in mind I&apos;ve included two<br/>other piano pieces that probably project better.</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a></p><p>Sovittaja Park Prelude No. 6<br/>tunings derived empirically from fretless guitar improvisations</p><p>Sovittaja Park Prelude No. 1<br/>tunings derived empirically from fretless guitar improvisations</p><p>untitled piano piece_1<br/>tunings derived empirically from fretless guitar improvisations</p><p>untitled piano piece_2<br/>combines 7, 19 and 20-TET</p></div>
