I read the<br/>&gt; tutorial, but I&apos;m still not exactly sure what it does.<br/>&gt; Is it basically a MIDI relay?</p><p>A multi-channel midi transposer.<br/>Basically, Open Tuning has been written by myself for... myself!  :-)<br/>As a midi guitarist, I wanted a software to play some<br/>virtual open tunings without retuning my guitar each time!</p><p>&gt; 2) Speaking of sales, it says it&apos;s not freeware, but it doesn&apos;t say<br/>&gt; it&apos;s being sold, either.  What&apos;s the deal?</p><p>This first version can be try out and use for free  ;-)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Philippe</p></div>
