Listen the  most<br/>&gt;recent attempts to retune a piece of music somebody else wrote  (though I&apos;ll<br/>&gt;probably post corrections to it ad infinitum as I discover  error after error in<br/>&gt;my calculations)!&quot;</p><p>    I don&apos;t think Marcel&apos;s theory sounds bad (actually it sounds pretty good to<br/>me)....though I can understand how others would.  Also, for the record, I think<br/>discovering errors in one theories is part of the gradual process of improving<br/>them.  However, I do question just how many people are interested in theories<br/>that supposedly &quot;merge toward the true nature of existing classical works&apos;<br/>intentions&quot;...especially considering Marcel, for example, is NOT Beethoven nor<br/>his prophet. :-D</p><p>    My stance has always been this.  If you don&apos;t like something, don&apos;t reply to<br/>it.  And If you find a somewhat scientific basis (yes that includes surveying a<br/>few listeners to see if they agree with a subjective opinion of yours) for<br/>saying someone&apos;s theory is faulty, that&apos;s fine as well.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Normally, I just avoid the lout, but talking smack to Dante Rosati is<br/>&gt;unforgivable.&quot;<br/>  But by replying to that person and saying &quot;you&apos;re wrong, but I can&apos;t say why<br/>other than I don&apos;t find your work valid&quot;, their human response is likely to be<br/>&quot;oh yeah...I&apos;ve worked X amount of time on this...and it sure is valid...now all<br/>I have to do is prove it to you (and you&apos;ll be willing to show interest)!&quot;  It<br/>gets even more this way, I swear, when you say talking smack...as if to say<br/>&quot;your opinion doesn&apos;t matter, even if I can&apos;t guess disprove it, simply because<br/>the other person has a stronger reputation in community.  Yes, you&apos;re right: it<br/>does have an aire of  being &quot;like a stunted dwarf of a teenager telling<br/>Shaquille O&apos;Neil that he doesn&apos;t know how to play basketball&quot;...but at the same<br/>time it has the aire of Shaq going up to middle school student who practices a<br/>lot and it getting better and saying &quot;give it up already and stop trying to get<br/>any respect for you&apos;re basketball skills: you are nothing&quot;: you&apos;d be surprised<br/>how many kids would say &quot;oh yeah...I&apos;m going to keep getting better...wait until<br/>I&apos;m in college ball maybe even as an NBA prospect and you&apos;re just an old has<br/>been!&quot;.</p><p>     When people get consistently ignored on a topic, they eventually give up.<br/>Heck, I&apos;ve dropped topics quickly when people don&apos;t respond within, say, a<br/>week.  I doubt Marcel is so ignorant as to go hammering along on a topic with no<br/>interest shown either.  The other thing you can do is go around starting<br/>interesting topics that indirectly make other people ignore Marcel&apos;s topics<br/>more.  But I don&apos;t think flaming Marcel is going to help anything...beside get<br/>him more steamed up and more eager to prove you wrong.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=23104 href="#23104">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/15/2010 9:20:41 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Marcel&gt;&quot;Well, so far nobody has produced anything better than what I did.<br/>And I did not get a single reply that my tuning is out of tune.&quot;<br/>  While a lot of what you did sounded good...that 40/27 dyad in your tuning, for<br/>example, really didn&apos;t sound very confident to me.<br/>   No matter what you do, people are going to dislike certain intervals in your<br/>scales (I know this from experience).<br/>   One good musical goal then seems to become how do you get as many possible<br/>intervals-chords you and a good few others like per added note?...though of<br/>course there are others.</p><p>&gt;&quot;that you&apos;re indeed the only one who thinks 8tet and 13tet are &quot;pretty&quot;.&quot;<br/>  That&apos;s a catch 22 question.

There are many good synthetic sounds/samples/virtual instruments that can be mapped to GM.

In<br/>&gt; fact I know it.<br/>&gt; To your bag of tricks:<br/>&gt; First - what do you mean &quot;GM sounds&quot;? Is Scala bound somehow to GM?<br/>&gt; There are many good synthetic sounds/samples/virtual instruments that<br/>&gt; can be mapped to GM. Some music sound very good with cheap/crappy sounds.<br/>&gt; Second - generally yes, octave doubling can help in many cases. But e.g.<br/>&gt; in 11edo strong consonance of octaves compared with the character of all<br/>&gt; other intervals is disturbing for me.<br/>&gt; Third - I agree.<br/>&gt; Fourth - interesting, I must try to compare 13edo and 14edo sometime.<br/>&gt; Fifth - yes, yes, yes....<br/>&gt; Best<br/>&gt; Milan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!

Anybody can use any tuning as he/<br/>&gt; she wants and feels, even against the rules which are behind that<br/>&gt; tuning. Theory is one thing, art is free. Creativity is borderless<br/>&gt; and should be so. The most important thing in any music is a<br/>&gt; proportional balance between contents and form.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Daniel Forro<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 16 Sep 2010, at 7:31 AM, Kraig Grady wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;    Not all tunings are created equal.<br/>&gt;&gt; there are eagles and there are pigeons.<br/>&gt;&gt; and allot of dodos<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; /^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^ /Kraig Grady_ ^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>&gt;&gt; Mesotonal Music from:<br/>&gt;&gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>&gt;&gt; North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island&lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; _&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>&gt;&gt; Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria<br/>&gt;&gt; &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; &apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; a momentary antenna as i turn to water<br/>&gt;&gt; this evaporates - an island once again<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;that you&apos;re indeed the only one who thinks 8tet and 13tet are<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;pretty&quot;.&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;     That&apos;s a catch 22 question.  I don&apos;t think there are &quot;pretty<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; vs. ugly&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; tunings, but are some where it is easier to comes across more<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; chords and others<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; where it&apos;s harder but the chords are more unique and, to some,<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; more expressive.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 8TET and 13TET seem to fall into the latter category.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo!
