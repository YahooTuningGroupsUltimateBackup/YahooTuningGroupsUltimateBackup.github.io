Toby Twining is going to give me<br/>some lessons as independent study this semester, and I&apos;m offering him<br/>this program.  Since all the necessary files are under open license,<br/>I&apos;m hoping to soon package the whole thing as one zip file.<br/>Also, I wrote up these instructions for the Pure Data list, so if<br/>there is terminology you don&apos;t follow, I&apos;ll change it...</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>-Chuckk</p><p>Instructions:</p><p>_OPERATION_<br/>The patch to open is JI.pd.  This should open a control window and a<br/>blank score.<br/>The 8 &quot;JIvoice&quot; abstractions in the main control window are the<br/>instruments.  Each has a different color, since they are all on the<br/>same spread.  The numberbox next to each JIvoice is for assigning MIDI<br/>program numbers to colors.  The vertical radio buttons are for<br/>selecting which voice to add to the score.  The colored toggles right<br/>next to the JIvoice abstractions were to be for muting, but this<br/>hasn&apos;t yet been implemented.  Underneath the JIvoice boxes is a<br/>horizontal radio with three options.  MIDI turns off all audio<br/>processing and sends pitch bends, program changes, and notes to MIDI<br/>out; this won&apos;t work with any softsynths I know, because each note is<br/>sent to a different channel.  It will only work with samplers or<br/>soundfonts.  By default, PD output is turned on, and audio is on.<br/>This will generate audio according to the parameters for each voice:<br/>click on a JIvoice to see the parameters.  The only thing I&apos;ll say<br/>about this window is that the FOF parameters at the bottom are only<br/>set up for MIDI control as of now; changing the numbers manually won&apos;t<br/>work.  The only other thing I&apos;ll say is that the preset system has<br/>been getting jiggy with it... use caution if you use presets.  They<br/>are saved in the .prs file with the same name as the .ji file for each<br/>score.</p><p>To open a piece, click on the symbol box under &quot;Filename&quot; in the upper<br/>right.  Type in, for instance, &quot;sonata04rondo&quot; and hit enter, then<br/>click the &quot;load&quot; messagebox.  You should see the score for the 4th<br/>movement of my JI sonata.  Next click on the gray and purple JIvoice<br/>boxes in turn, and play with some of the parameters.  Just make sure<br/>there is some kind of waveform in the box.  Click the PLAY toggle in<br/>either the main window or a JIvoice panel.  Music.</p><p>_TRANSPORT_</p><p>The buttons should be self-explanatory.  To record to an audio file,<br/>select wave or AIFF under the RECORD button.  Type the name for the<br/>output file, hit enter, and hit RECORD/STOP once.  The num2 GUIs in<br/>the middle of the main window show the time in minutes and seconds for<br/>PLAY, but not for RECORD<br/>The transport can be controlled with the keyboard.  Control-I starts<br/>playback, and &quot;I&quot; alone stops it.  Control-PageUp moves the playback<br/>cursor back one quarter-note, and Ctl-PageDown moves it forward one<br/>quarter note.  Clt-Home moves the playback cursor to the beginning.<br/>Under Windows, Ctl-Help and Ctl-Delete move the cursor forward and<br/>back by 4 quarter notes at a time.</p><p>_SCORE EDITING_</p><p>This is the main reason for this patch to exist.  With the main window<br/>active, switch to the score window.  This should enable the mouse<br/>control.<br/>The important keys to know:</p><p>Q: prepares the mouse cursor to enter notes.  You should see a black<br/>preview note jump to the mouse when you hit Q, and it cycles through<br/>common note ratios when you move the mouse.  If you now click the<br/>mouse, you create a note.</p><p>E: disables note entry so it&apos;s safe to click on the score, and sets<br/>the score window to edit mode.  You can now select wrong notes and<br/>delete them, or whatever.</p><p>Ex2: hitting E again returns from edit mode, but does not prepare the<br/>score for editing.  This way, you can drag on the right end of a note<br/>line and change the duration.  Hit Q again to enter more notes.</p><p>1-0: the number keys change the duration of the preview note.</p><p>Shift+1-8: Shift and numbers 1-8 changes the voice to be entered, as<br/>well as the color of the preview note.</p><p>T: the most important one of all.  This causes the entire score to<br/>transpose to the key of the preview note; whatever ratio is showing by<br/>the mouse cursor will become 1/1 and the whole score changes to<br/>reflect the new DO (not an abbreviation... DO as in &quot;a female deer&quot;).</p><p>G: also important.  If you accidentally hit T without looking, or go<br/>through a series of changes and lose track of the original key, G will<br/>return the entire score to 1/1 = Middle C.</p><p>Y and H: Y and H change the volume of the note to be added.  You will<br/>see the small vertical block on the preview note increase or decrease.</p><p>, and .   OR    &lt; and &gt;:  these change the rhythmic quantizing of the<br/>preview note placement.  &lt; snaps to 1/6 of a quarter note, and &gt; snaps<br/>to 1/4 of a quarter note.</p><p>All of the score editing is enabled by the toxy external.  So have it.</p><p>_MEASURES_</p><p>This only works from the main window.  To the right and just down from<br/>the main Volume, select the number of measures to add, and underneat<br/>that, select the time signature.  Hit the button to the right of the<br/>number-of-measures-to-add to add them.  Hit Clear if you want to<br/>remove all of them.  Changing existing measures is a biaiaitch at this<br/>point.  Not sure how to fix it.</p><p>_TEMPO_</p><p>The &apos;Add Breakpoint&apos; button will insert a tempo marker with the<br/>current value wherever the playback cursor is.  It will be relative to<br/>whatever note value you select to the right, but this will not be<br/>visible in the score.  Also, only exponential tempo currently works.<br/>I came up with a solution to make the tempo change exponentially, and<br/>never got around to reconnecting the linear tempo change.  &quot;Ignore<br/>Tempos&quot; will playback a score at whatever speed you select, instead of<br/>what the markers say.</p><p>_MIXING_</p><p>Open pd mixer if you like, it&apos;s hiding to the right of the Tempo<br/>section of the main window.</p><p>_CAUTIONS_</p><p>There are many other features that I created and don&apos;t use much<br/>anymore, or just aren&apos;t as essential.  Experiment, but save your stuff<br/>if you come up with anything you like.  The save feature won&apos;t ask<br/>about overwriting, so make sure you type a new name for each file<br/>before saving.  The zoom has worked and not worked correctly at<br/>various stages; everything I added after the zoom had to incorporate a<br/>sort of &quot;zoom cosmological constant&quot; called &quot;zoomfact&quot;, and I can&apos;t<br/>guarantee I put it everywhere it should be.  The &quot;EDIT THE SCORE&quot;<br/>section is pretty much replaced by mouse editing.  It still works; it<br/>highlights individual notes in red... but sometimes leaves them red.<br/>That whole section is scary.<br/>The selecting/copy/paste/move/transpose section is also scary, but a<br/>little more reliable.  It reads the location of the playback cursor<br/>and selects what&apos;s between the Start and End spots.  This &quot;transpose&quot;<br/>function actually changes the heights and pitches of the selected<br/>notes, instead of just the ratio names.</p><p>_BIG BIG CAUTION_</p><p>The worst thing you can do is edit the patch itself and save it while<br/>a score is open.  The preset memory function stores the entire<br/>waveform for each preset added in memory, and if you save the patch it<br/>will grow in size giamongously.  If this happens, edit JI.pd in a text<br/>editor and remove everything between &quot;canvas .... presetmemory&quot; and<br/>&quot;restore .... presetmemory&quot;, and between &quot;canvas ..... score&quot; and<br/>&quot;restore ..... score&quot;.  If you edit the patch itself, I suggest<br/>closing it using the &quot;Close&quot; messagebox to the right of the Zoom<br/>function.  This clears the presets and score, and saves and closes the<br/>patch.</p><p>_LICENSE_</p><p>You may not become a millionaire off of my JI scoring idea and not<br/>split it with me.  Pretty much anything else is okay.  Unless you&apos;re<br/>already a millionaire, in which case you must pay me to write music.</p></div><h3><a id=14618 href="#14618">ðŸ”—</a>Rozencrantz the Sane &#x3C;rozencrantz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/1/2006 11:39:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Chuckk,</p><p>I downloaded the patch and got it set up, but pressing Q doesn&apos;t seem<br/>to do anything.

If you are interested in Pure Data, you<br/>could probably manage it.  I could give it a try.<br/>Each octave has a 240-pixel vertical resolution.

I have it set up to find the closest of my<br/>intervals to the mouse cursor, but if it were set up to just divide<br/>those 240 pixels by how many total intervals were available, you<br/>could conceivably have 240 default ratios.  120 would be much much<br/>easier to use, mouse-wise.

Some instructions are<br/>&gt; below. I used this program to write the JI sonata at<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.badmuthahubbard.com/music.html">http://www.badmuthahubbard.com/music.html</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; PLEASE let me know if this doesn&apos;t work for you (what platform are you<br/>&gt; using?) or if the instructions or the program are too confusing, and<br/>&gt; help me get the process figured out. Toby Twining is going to give me<br/>&gt; some lessons as independent study this semester, and I&apos;m offering him<br/>&gt; this program. Since all the necessary files are under open license,<br/>&gt; I&apos;m hoping to soon package the whole thing as one zip file.<br/>&gt; Also, I wrote up these instructions for the Pure Data list, so if<br/>&gt; there is terminology you don&apos;t follow, I&apos;ll change it...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Chuckk<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Instructions:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _OPERATION_<br/>&gt; The patch to open is JI.pd. This should open a control window and a<br/>&gt; blank score.<br/>&gt; The 8 &quot;JIvoice&quot; abstractions in the main control window are the<br/>&gt; instruments. Each has a different color, since they are all on the<br/>&gt; same spread. The numberbox next to each JIvoice is for assigning MIDI<br/>&gt; program numbers to colors. The vertical radio buttons are for<br/>&gt; selecting which voice to add to the score. The colored toggles right<br/>&gt; next to the JIvoice abstractions were to be for muting, but this<br/>&gt; hasn&apos;t yet been implemented. Underneath the JIvoice boxes is a<br/>&gt; horizontal radio with three options. MIDI turns off all audio<br/>&gt; processing and sends pitch bends, program changes, and notes to MIDI<br/>&gt; out; this won&apos;t work with any softsynths I know, because each note is<br/>&gt; sent to a different channel. It will only work with samplers or<br/>&gt; soundfonts. By default, PD output is turned on, and audio is on.<br/>&gt; This will generate audio according to the parameters for each voice:<br/>&gt; click on a JIvoice to see the parameters. The only thing I&apos;ll say<br/>&gt; about this window is that the FOF parameters at the bottom are only<br/>&gt; set up for MIDI control as of now; changing the numbers manually won&apos;t<br/>&gt; work. The only other thing I&apos;ll say is that the preset system has<br/>&gt; been getting jiggy with it... use caution if you use presets. They<br/>&gt; are saved in the .prs file with the same name as the .ji file for each<br/>&gt; score.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To open a piece, click on the symbol box under &quot;Filename&quot; in the upper<br/>&gt; right. Type in, for instance, &quot;sonata04rondo&quot; and hit enter, then<br/>&gt; click the &quot;load&quot; messagebox. You should see the score for the 4th<br/>&gt; movement of my JI sonata. Next click on the gray and purple JIvoice<br/>&gt; boxes in turn, and play with some of the parameters. Just make sure<br/>&gt; there is some kind of waveform in the box. Click the PLAY toggle in<br/>&gt; either the main window or a JIvoice panel. Music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _TRANSPORT_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The buttons should be self-explanatory. To record to an audio file,<br/>&gt; select wave or AIFF under the RECORD button. Type the name for the<br/>&gt; output file, hit enter, and hit RECORD/STOP once. The num2 GUIs in<br/>&gt; the middle of the main window show the time in minutes and seconds for<br/>&gt; PLAY, but not for RECORD<br/>&gt; The transport can be controlled with the keyboard. Control-I starts<br/>&gt; playback, and &quot;I&quot; alone stops it. Control-PageUp moves the playback<br/>&gt; cursor back one quarter-note, and Ctl-PageDown moves it forward one<br/>&gt; quarter note. Clt-Home moves the playback cursor to the beginning.<br/>&gt; Under Windows, Ctl-Help and Ctl-Delete move the cursor forward and<br/>&gt; back by 4 quarter notes at a time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _SCORE EDITING_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is the main reason for this patch to exist. With the main window<br/>&gt; active, switch to the score window. This should enable the mouse<br/>&gt; control.<br/>&gt; The important keys to know:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Q: prepares the mouse cursor to enter notes. You should see a black<br/>&gt; preview note jump to the mouse when you hit Q, and it cycles through<br/>&gt; common note ratios when you move the mouse. If you now click the<br/>&gt; mouse, you create a note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; E: disables note entry so it&apos;s safe to click on the score, and sets<br/>&gt; the score window to edit mode. You can now select wrong notes and<br/>&gt; delete them, or whatever.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ex2: hitting E again returns from edit mode, but does not prepare the<br/>&gt; score for editing. This way, you can drag on the right end of a note<br/>&gt; line and change the duration. Hit Q again to enter more notes.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1-0: the number keys change the duration of the preview note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Shift+1-8: Shift and numbers 1-8 changes the voice to be entered, as<br/>&gt; well as the color of the preview note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; T: the most important one of all. This causes the entire score to<br/>&gt; transpose to the key of the preview note; whatever ratio is showing by<br/>&gt; the mouse cursor will become 1/1 and the whole score changes to<br/>&gt; reflect the new DO (not an abbreviation... DO as in &quot;a female deer&quot;).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; G: also important. If you accidentally hit T without looking, or go<br/>&gt; through a series of changes and lose track of the original key, G will<br/>&gt; return the entire score to 1/1 = Middle C.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Y and H: Y and H change the volume of the note to be added. You will<br/>&gt; see the small vertical block on the preview note increase or decrease.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; , and . OR &lt; and &gt;: these change the rhythmic quantizing of the<br/>&gt; preview note placement. &lt; snaps to 1/6 of a quarter note, and &gt; snaps<br/>&gt; to 1/4 of a quarter note.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All of the score editing is enabled by the toxy external. So have it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _MEASURES_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This only works from the main window. To the right and just down from<br/>&gt; the main Volume, select the number of measures to add, and underneat<br/>&gt; that, select the time signature. Hit the button to the right of the<br/>&gt; number-of-measures-to-add to add them. Hit Clear if you want to<br/>&gt; remove all of them. Changing existing measures is a biaiaitch at this<br/>&gt; point. Not sure how to fix it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _TEMPO_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The &apos;Add Breakpoint&apos; button will insert a tempo marker with the<br/>&gt; current value wherever the playback cursor is. It will be relative to<br/>&gt; whatever note value you select to the right, but this will not be<br/>&gt; visible in the score. Also, only exponential tempo currently works.<br/>&gt; I came up with a solution to make the tempo change exponentially, and<br/>&gt; never got around to reconnecting the linear tempo change. &quot;Ignore<br/>&gt; Tempos&quot; will playback a score at whatever speed you select, instead of<br/>&gt; what the markers say.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _MIXING_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Open pd mixer if you like, it&apos;s hiding to the right of the Tempo<br/>&gt; section of the main window.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _CAUTIONS_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are many other features that I created and don&apos;t use much<br/>&gt; anymore, or just aren&apos;t as essential. Experiment, but save your stuff<br/>&gt; if you come up with anything you like. The save feature won&apos;t ask<br/>&gt; about overwriting, so make sure you type a new name for each file<br/>&gt; before saving. The zoom has worked and not worked correctly at<br/>&gt; various stages; everything I added after the zoom had to incorporate a<br/>&gt; sort of &quot;zoom cosmological constant&quot; called &quot;zoomfact&quot;, and I can&apos;t<br/>&gt; guarantee I put it everywhere it should be. The &quot;EDIT THE SCORE&quot;<br/>&gt; section is pretty much replaced by mouse editing. It still works; it<br/>&gt; highlights individual notes in red... but sometimes leaves them red.<br/>&gt; That whole section is scary.<br/>&gt; The selecting/copy/paste/move/transpose section is also scary, but a<br/>&gt; little more reliable. It reads the location of the playback cursor<br/>&gt; and selects what&apos;s between the Start and End spots. This &quot;transpose&quot;<br/>&gt; function actually changes the heights and pitches of the selected<br/>&gt; notes, instead of just the ratio names.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _BIG BIG CAUTION_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The worst thing you can do is edit the patch itself and save it while<br/>&gt; a score is open. The preset memory function stores the entire<br/>&gt; waveform for each preset added in memory, and if you save the patch it<br/>&gt; will grow in size giamongously. If this happens, edit JI.pd in a text<br/>&gt; editor and remove everything between &quot;canvas .... presetmemory&quot; and<br/>&gt; &quot;restore .... presetmemory&quot;, and between &quot;canvas ..... score&quot; and<br/>&gt; &quot;restore ..... score&quot;. If you edit the patch itself, I suggest<br/>&gt; closing it using the &quot;Close&quot; messagebox to the right of the Zoom<br/>&gt; function. This clears the presets and score, and saves and closes the<br/>&gt; patch.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; _LICENSE_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You may not become a millionaire off of my JI scoring idea and not<br/>&gt; split it with me. Pretty much anything else is okay. Unless you&apos;re<br/>&gt; already a millionaire, in which case you must pay me to write music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=14649 href="#14649">ðŸ”—</a>Chuckk Hubbard &#x3C;BadMuthaHubbard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/4/2006 8:25:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>There are definitely functions that are sensitive, and I could<br/>improve some.

So it is possible to sequence a melody or<br/>&gt; &gt; modulate or borrow chords from other tonalities without doing<br/>&gt; &gt; multiplication.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The program runs in the Pure Data programming environment. The<br/>&gt; &gt; simplest way to set it up is to download pd-extended from<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://puredata.info/downloads">http://puredata.info/downloads</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; My sequencer program:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="https://www.puredata.info/Members/badmuthahubbard/index_html/view">https://www.puredata.info/Members/badmuthahubbard/index_html/view</a>?<br/>searchterm=bad%20mutha%20hubbard<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You have to start Pure Data (PD-extended) and make sure your<br/>audio is<br/>&gt; &gt; set up, then open &quot;JI.pd&quot; from my folder. Some instructions are<br/>&gt; &gt; below. I used this program to write the JI sonata at<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.badmuthahubbard.com/music.html">http://www.badmuthahubbard.com/music.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; PLEASE let me know if this doesn&apos;t work for you (what platform<br/>are you<br/>&gt; &gt; using?) or if the instructions or the program are too confusing,<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; help me get the process figured out. Toby Twining is going to<br/>give me<br/>&gt; &gt; some lessons as independent study this semester, and I&apos;m offering<br/>him<br/>&gt; &gt; this program. Since all the necessary files are under open<br/>license,<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m hoping to soon package the whole thing as one zip file.<br/>&gt; &gt; Also, I wrote up these instructions for the Pure Data list, so if<br/>&gt; &gt; there is terminology you don&apos;t follow, I&apos;ll change it...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; -Chuckk<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Instructions:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; _OPERATION_<br/>&gt; &gt; The patch to open is JI.pd. This should open a control window and<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; blank score.<br/>&gt; &gt; The 8 &quot;JIvoice&quot; abstractions in the main control window are the<br/>&gt; &gt; instruments. Each has a different color, since they are all on the<br/>&gt; &gt; same spread. The numberbox next to each JIvoice is for assigning<br/>MIDI<br/>&gt; &gt; program numbers to colors. The vertical radio buttons are for<br/>&gt; &gt; selecting which voice to add to the score. The colored toggles<br/>right<br/>&gt; &gt; next to the JIvoice abstractions were to be for muting, but this<br/>&gt; &gt; hasn&apos;t yet been implemented. Underneath the JIvoice boxes is a<br/>&gt; &gt; horizontal radio with three options. MIDI turns off all audio<br/>&gt; &gt; processing and sends pitch bends, program changes, and notes to<br/>MIDI<br/>&gt; &gt; out; this won&apos;t work with any softsynths I know, because each<br/>note is<br/>&gt; &gt; sent to a different channel. It will only work with samplers or<br/>&gt; &gt; soundfonts. By default, PD output is turned on, and audio is on.<br/>&gt; &gt; This will generate audio according to the parameters for each<br/>voice:<br/>&gt; &gt; click on a JIvoice to see the parameters. The only thing I&apos;ll say<br/>&gt; &gt; about this window is that the FOF parameters at the bottom are<br/>only<br/>&gt; &gt; set up for MIDI control as of now; changing the numbers manually<br/>won&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; work. The only other thing I&apos;ll say is that the preset system has<br/>&gt; &gt; been getting jiggy with it... use caution if you use presets. They<br/>&gt; &gt; are saved in the .prs file with the same name as the .ji file for<br/>each<br/>&gt; &gt; score.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; To open a piece, click on the symbol box under &quot;Filename&quot; in the<br/>upper<br/>&gt; &gt; right. Type in, for instance, &quot;sonata04rondo&quot; and hit enter, then<br/>&gt; &gt; click the &quot;load&quot; messagebox. You should see the score for the 4th<br/>&gt; &gt; movement of my JI sonata. Next click on the gray and purple<br/>JIvoice<br/>&gt; &gt; boxes in turn, and play with some of the parameters. Just make<br/>sure<br/>&gt; &gt; there is some kind of waveform in the box. Click the PLAY toggle<br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; either the main window or a JIvoice panel. Music.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; _TRANSPORT_<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The buttons should be self-explanatory. To record to an audio<br/>file,<br/>&gt; &gt; select wave or AIFF under the RECORD button. Type the name for the<br/>&gt; &gt; output file, hit enter, and hit RECORD/STOP once. The num2 GUIs in<br/>&gt; &gt; the middle of the main window show the time in minutes and<br/>seconds for<br/>&gt; &gt; PLAY, but not for RECORD<br/>&gt; &gt; The transport can be controlled with the keyboard. Control-I<br/>starts<br/>&gt; &gt; playback, and &quot;I&quot; alone stops it. Control-PageUp moves the<br/>playback<br/>&gt; &gt; cursor back one quarter-note, and Ctl-PageDown moves it forward<br/>one<br/>&gt; &gt; quarter note. Clt-Home moves the playback cursor to the beginning.<br/>&gt; &gt; Under Windows, Ctl-Help and Ctl-Delete move the cursor forward and<br/>&gt; &gt; back by 4 quarter notes at a time.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; _SCORE EDITING_<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This is the main reason for this patch to exist. With the main<br/>window<br/>&gt; &gt; active, switch to the score window. This should enable the mouse<br/>&gt; &gt; control.<br/>&gt; &gt; The important keys to know:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Q: prepares the mouse cursor to enter notes. You should see a<br/>black<br/>&gt; &gt; preview note jump to the mouse when you hit Q, and it cycles<br/>through<br/>&gt; &gt; common note ratios when you move the mouse. If you now click the<br/>&gt; &gt; mouse, you create a note.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; E: disables note entry so it&apos;s safe to click on the score, and<br/>sets<br/>&gt; &gt; the score window to edit mode. You can now select wrong notes and<br/>&gt; &gt; delete them, or whatever.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Ex2: hitting E again returns from edit mode, but does not prepare<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; score for editing. This way, you can drag on the right end of a<br/>note<br/>&gt; &gt; line and change the duration. Hit Q again to enter more notes.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1-0: the number keys change the duration of the preview note.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Shift+1-8: Shift and numbers 1-8 changes the voice to be entered,<br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; well as the color of the preview note.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; T: the most important one of all. This causes the entire score to<br/>&gt; &gt; transpose to the key of the preview note; whatever ratio is<br/>showing by<br/>&gt; &gt; the mouse cursor will become 1/1 and the whole score changes to<br/>&gt; &gt; reflect the new DO (not an abbreviation... DO as in &quot;a female<br/>deer&quot;).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; G: also important. If you accidentally hit T without looking, or<br/>go<br/>&gt; &gt; through a series of changes and lose track of the original key, G<br/>will<br/>&gt; &gt; return the entire score to 1/1 = Middle C.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Y and H: Y and H change the volume of the note to be added. You<br/>will<br/>&gt; &gt; see the small vertical block on the preview note increase or<br/>decrease.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; , and . OR &lt; and &gt;: these change the rhythmic quantizing of the<br/>&gt; &gt; preview note placement. &lt; snaps to 1/6 of a quarter note, and &gt;<br/>snaps<br/>&gt; &gt; to 1/4 of a quarter note.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; All of the score editing is enabled by the toxy external. So have<br/>it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; _MEASURES_<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This only works from the main window. To the right and just down<br/>from<br/>&gt; &gt; the main Volume, select the number of measures to add, and<br/>underneat<br/>&gt; &gt; that, select the time signature. Hit the button to the right of<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; number-of-measures-to-add to add them. Hit Clear if you want to<br/>&gt; &gt; remove all of them. Changing existing measures is a biaiaitch at<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt; point. Not sure how to fix it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; _TEMPO_<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The &apos;Add Breakpoint&apos; button will insert a tempo marker with the<br/>&gt; &gt; current value wherever the playback cursor is. It will be<br/>relative to<br/>&gt; &gt; whatever note value you select to the right, but this will not be<br/>&gt; &gt; visible in the score. Also, only exponential tempo currently<br/>works.<br/>&gt; &gt; I came up with a solution to make the tempo change exponentially,<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; never got around to reconnecting the linear tempo change. &quot;Ignore<br/>&gt; &gt; Tempos&quot; will playback a score at whatever speed you select,<br/>instead of<br/>&gt; &gt; what the markers say.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; _MIXING_<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Open pd mixer if you like, it&apos;s hiding to the right of the Tempo<br/>&gt; &gt; section of the main window.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; _CAUTIONS_<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There are many other features that I created and don&apos;t use much<br/>&gt; &gt; anymore, or just aren&apos;t as essential. Experiment, but save your<br/>stuff<br/>&gt; &gt; if you come up with anything you like. The save feature won&apos;t ask<br/>&gt; &gt; about overwriting, so make sure you type a new name for each file<br/>&gt; &gt; before saving. The zoom has worked and not worked correctly at<br/>&gt; &gt; various stages; everything I added after the zoom had to<br/>incorporate a<br/>&gt; &gt; sort of &quot;zoom cosmological constant&quot; called &quot;zoomfact&quot;, and I<br/>can&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; guarantee I put it everywhere it should be. The &quot;EDIT THE SCORE&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; section is pretty much replaced by mouse editing. It still works;<br/>it<br/>&gt; &gt; highlights individual notes in red... but sometimes leaves them<br/>red.<br/>&gt; &gt; That whole section is scary.<br/>&gt; &gt; The selecting/copy/paste/move/transpose section is also scary,<br/>but a<br/>&gt; &gt; little more reliable. It reads the location of the playback cursor<br/>&gt; &gt; and selects what&apos;s between the Start and End spots.<br/>This &quot;transpose&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; function actually changes the heights and pitches of the selected<br/>&gt; &gt; notes, instead of just the ratio names.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; _BIG BIG CAUTION_<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The worst thing you can do is edit the patch itself and save it<br/>while<br/>&gt; &gt; a score is open. The preset memory function stores the entire<br/>&gt; &gt; waveform for each preset added in memory, and if you save the<br/>patch it<br/>&gt; &gt; will grow in size giamongously. If this happens, edit JI.pd in a<br/>text<br/>&gt; &gt; editor and remove everything between &quot;canvas .... presetmemory&quot;<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;restore .... presetmemory&quot;, and between &quot;canvas ..... score&quot; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;restore ..... score&quot;. If you edit the patch itself, I suggest<br/>&gt; &gt; closing it using the &quot;Close&quot; messagebox to the right of the Zoom<br/>&gt; &gt; function. This clears the presets and score, and saves and closes<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; patch.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; _LICENSE_<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You may not become a millionaire off of my JI scoring idea and not<br/>&gt; &gt; split it with me. Pretty much anything else is okay. Unless you&apos;re<br/>&gt; &gt; already a millionaire, in which case you must pay me to write<br/>music.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=14652 href="#14652">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2006 12:50:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 03:35 PM 9/3/2006, you wrote:<br/>&gt;I figured out how to package it all as one installable program, for<br/>&gt;Windows XP.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.badmuthahubbard.com/JIsetup.exe">http://www.badmuthahubbard.com/JIsetup.exe</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;is the setup file.<br/>&gt;It installs to C:\\Program Files\JIsequencer.

This is actually a function of the programming<br/>environment, Pure Data, not of my patch.  So be careful not to<br/>highlight other notes or barlines, because it will highlight whatever<br/>is where you click.  You can delete several notes or tempo markers by<br/>holding SHIFT and clicking them, then Backspace.</p><p>&gt; &gt;It&apos;s easier to see the rhythm if you enter some measures first;<br/>look<br/>&gt; &gt;for 3 number fields and one button that say &quot;Add Measures&quot;.  The<br/>&gt; &gt;numbers say how many measures of what, and the button adds them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can&apos;t get that to work.  It seems to want to replace the time sig.<br/>&gt; with negative numbers or zeros.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl</p><p><a href="http://img156.imageshack.us/my.php?image=addmeasuresae3.jpg">http://img156.imageshack.us/my.php?image=addmeasuresae3.jpg</a><br/>If you put in the number of measures and the top and bottom of the<br/>time signature, and then click the button to add, you should get this<br/>result.  I know it&apos;s confusing from the position of the fields;<br/>something to clean up when I revise it.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p></div><h3><a id=14681 href="#14681">ðŸ”—</a>Chuckk Hubbard &#x3C;BadMuthaHubbard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/5/2006 9:57:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; &lt;ekin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Instructions:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; _OPERATION_<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chuckk, have you considered including this as a readme<br/>&gt; in the installer?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Carl<br/>&gt;</p><p>Yeah, I guess I&apos;ve just been afraid I wouldn&apos;t feel the need to revise<br/>it if I put it in now.

I agree with Tristan that the timbre you chose is really<br/>effective.

It should<br/>be trivial to fix though, actually.</p><p>I am also aware of the accidental notes.  I&apos;ve tried numerous<br/>workarounds.  The way it works is that, when the score is cleared<br/>(which happens on load), a message is then sent to the score to<br/>create an &quot;active&quot; object and a sender.  These are visible if you<br/>scroll the whole way down.  This object tells Pure Data when the<br/>score is the front screen, so that mouse clicks on other windows<br/>don&apos;t add notes.  Alas, clicking on the window itself to bring it<br/>forward usually adds a note.  I tried putting in a delay, so note<br/>adding would be disabled until however many milliseconds after the<br/>window became active, with limited success.  The only way so far to<br/>avoid it is to only click on the gray area or the menu bar of the<br/>score window when switching screens.  I usually also hit E nervously<br/>several times whenever I switch screens.  If, somehow, adding notes<br/>is enabled while the hand is showing, hitting E twice should reset it.<br/>BTW, the reason you have to drag-select the note to delete it is<br/>because it is a whole stack of notes.

The sequencer can switch between them.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chuckk,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt; &gt;I haven&apos;t found a good solution for this, other than to compose<br/>using the built-in synth and then record one voice at a time with<br/>softsynths.
