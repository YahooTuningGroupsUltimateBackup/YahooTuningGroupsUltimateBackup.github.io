My first 3 cds are out of print, and i personally have no copies, but it appears that Michael Sheppard has a few left as he has sold a bunch to amoeba records in L.A. either you can go there and buy them or buy them trough me and i will go and get them. Strange idea to go into a CD store to buy your own work, but there are those that have expressed interest. The second CD from the interiors of Anaphoria is a special edition we made for the premiere of the shadow play that while the cover was xeroxed , they are signed by myself and banaphshu.<br/>Please contact me off list<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
