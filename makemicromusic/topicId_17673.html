I don&apos;t take offense at all.  Of course, what &quot;music&quot; is or is not is one of those philosophical questions that IMHO is simply not answerable in any final, objective way.</p><p>As far as my music is concerned (in particular, the music I post to this group, as opposed to the very dissimilar musics I make in other contexts, e.g. free improv, or post-rock acoustic guitars, etc.), I really think in architectural or sculptural terms, as &quot;objects&quot; in space made from sound.  In this regard, I take inspiration from Feldman, among others.  So I think your insights are relevant, and they are just fine with me.</p><p>Thanks for that hot stone massage, I needed one!  :-)</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:<br/>&gt; At 06:36 AM 9/16/2007, you wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt; Sveet.<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, I liked it too.
