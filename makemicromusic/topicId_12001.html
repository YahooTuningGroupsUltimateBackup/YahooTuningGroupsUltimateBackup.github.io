If you tune them to any other tuning, it will be necessary for the person importing them ...</p><p>I suppose I might have prefaced my comments with my intended use, but this would be for personal use. I don&apos;t foresee anyone else using these samples. One of the reasons I was questioning Prent about this was how much re-sampling, if at all, he has done. There are some samples that are perfectly stretchable or compressable to just work with someone else&apos;s 12tet set. But certain timbres seem to really show a different charcter before they&apos;ve gone 100 cents up or down, so I&apos;m not necessarily ready to just bend things away from 12tet and be satisfied.</p><p>Anyway, this would all be for a purpose-driven project/composition, and I&apos;d probably settle on a couple of tunings early on to design the sounds/instruments.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S.

Sample formats should not rely on the samples being<br/>actually in-tune, even to 12-tet. The sample *format* should store the<br/>actual nominal frequency of each sample, and the software that uses it<br/>should properly tune it as needed, with reference to the specified<br/>frequency. I think this is a big source of errors in existing sample sets,<br/>as Jon can probably attest. If you start with a slightly out-of-tune<br/>instrument, even by a small amount that&apos;s not really noticeable if used<br/>&quot;straight&quot; in 12-tet it may sound *very* out of tune when you start<br/>modifying its frequency (resampling) for use with other scales.</p><p>(Aside: Rhino apparently does the right thing. Though it&apos;s not a sampler,<br/>it can import samples. Rhino also supports microtuning. In the Rhino input<br/>format for samples, you are required to specify either the note  (&quot;c3&quot;) or<br/>the actual frequency. I always specify the measured frequency, and as long<br/>as it&apos;s correct, the tuning seems correct.)</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p><p>Charls Lucy wrote,</p><p>&gt; The system used for playback would then microtune then, and match<br/>&gt; other samples from other sample lbraries, as chosen from within the<br/>&gt; player software.</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/25/2006 3:23:43 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Rick McGowan wrote:<br/>&gt; If we&apos;re talking blue-sky here about how samples *should* be stored and  &gt; tuned by samplers...
