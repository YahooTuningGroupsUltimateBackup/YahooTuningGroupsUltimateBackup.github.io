All human beings have responsibilities towards their<br/>fellow human beings. This is what we call politics. I don&apos;t think that a<br/>composer as composer has any particular extra social responsibility in<br/>the immediate sense, than anyone else. But he does have a responsibility<br/>towards his art: its</p><p>daniel_anthony_stearns wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hmm, i like both you guys, and your music!, so don&apos;t hate me,ok.<br/>&gt; BUT.... i really disagree with this--not so much on the grounds of<br/>&gt; aesthetics and preferences, as EVERYBODY exaggerates and preaches in<br/>&gt; the direction of their interest and i&apos;m fine with that (and no less<br/>&gt; guilty i&apos;m sure). But what i disagree with is the assumption that<br/>&gt; everyone, or even anyone else besides someone who&apos;s so inclined,<br/>&gt; should want to &quot;make inroads into popular consciousness&quot; or anything<br/>&gt; that,well, &quot;sound more pleasant&quot;. I have no real disagreements with<br/>&gt; this per se. It&apos;s only when someone else is trying to say that maybe<br/>&gt; that&apos;s what I or someone besides themselves should do if they want to<br/>&gt; do it right and good.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Personally, i think music is at its best when it at least attempts to<br/>&gt; address some poetry of life, some hard to explain but easy to feel<br/>&gt; resonance that stirs something deeper than notes and tunings and<br/>&gt; instruments and form and all the rest. For me, music is much more<br/>&gt; about imagination, and creativity, than it is anything else... and if<br/>&gt; that&apos;s a rough road with bumps and dust and detours (that might lead<br/>&gt; you off the map and even astray), so be it, and all the better for<br/>&gt; it ! But THAT&apos;S ME, and i really ,honestly wouldn&apos;t expect anyone<br/>&gt; else to have to do it that way to make something worth the while.<br/>&gt; Ok...i feel better now! daniel<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; &lt;mailto:MakeMicroMusic%<a href="http://40yahoogroups.com">40yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, &quot;Igliashon Jones&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;igliashon@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thank you most kindly, Mr. Smith! I&apos;m glad to hear you appreciated<br/>&gt; my<br/>&gt; &gt; efforts. My point was indeed to make these tunes accessible, though<br/>&gt; &gt; as some have pointed out to me, they are quite &quot;dated&quot; sounding (as<br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; they&apos;d probably be more at home in the musical climate of 1987 than<br/>&gt; &gt; 2007) due to the FM-synth sounds and the general low-end digital<br/>&gt; &gt; production quality.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, the pop-song format employed in most of them is, I think,<br/>&gt; &gt; more appropriate for some of the less low-limit-consonant EDOs like<br/>&gt; 16<br/>&gt; &gt; and 11...when I hear composers come at those EDOs from a classical<br/>&gt; &gt; background, I can&apos;t help but think that the resulting compositions<br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; the audio equivalent of Vin Diesel trying to squeeze into a slinky<br/>&gt; &gt; prom dress. Really, the secret to making a lot of these tunings<br/>&gt; sound<br/>&gt; &gt; good is just to not get ambitious with them: find a simple tonality,<br/>&gt; &gt; stick to it, and avoid complex vertical structures. Lots of<br/>&gt; &gt; alternative tonalities do contain familiar progressions, and keeping<br/>&gt; &gt; just enough familiarity helps things sound more pleasant. And don&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt; be afraid to add some groovin&apos; beats. An interesting beat, I have<br/>&gt; &gt; found, can make even the dullest composition sound good.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thanks for listening!<br/>&gt; &gt; -Igs<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Igliashon, you wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I just uploaded 5 new songs to my microtonal music page at the<br/>&gt; above<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; address...&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Congrats, these are most excellent! My favorites of these<br/>&gt; are &quot;She Is My<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Lilac-Hued Obsession&quot; and &quot;Illegible Red Ink&quot;. Just goes to show<br/>&gt; how<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; difficult tunings can be turned to beautiful music in the hands<br/>&gt; of an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; artiste with good taste. The rest of us need to take notes -- pun<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; intended.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (Most of my &quot;microtonalist&quot; compadres are their own worst enemy,<br/>&gt; I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; afraid. Ear-cringing, spine-shuddering &quot;xenharmonies&quot; and gnarly<br/>&gt; timbres<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; do not a good case for alternate tunings make.)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If new tunings are to be accepted and used generally, they must<br/>&gt; first<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; make inroads into popular consciousness -- your music employs<br/>&gt; these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tunings in a way that is both easily absorbed and enjoyable. Very<br/>&gt; well<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; done indeed.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; jls<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
