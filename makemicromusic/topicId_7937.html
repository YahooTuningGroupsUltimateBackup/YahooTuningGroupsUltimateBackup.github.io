Prent Roger&apos;s lovely tunes prove that, as<br/>does ANY music that uses live instruments, samples thereof,  or sounds<br/>that aren&apos;t computer-engineered to mesh together completely perfectly<br/>(resulting in possible &quot;voice loss&quot;)-- such as sine tones or synthesized,<br/>non-vibrato, harmonic timbres.</p><p>I would think  that perfect JI is, in the end, impossible to achieve, with<br/>real instruments, voices, etc.  Most instruments have vibrato.<br/>Nothing&apos;s tuned perfectly 100%.  Again, except for computer synthesized<br/>sine tones, or La Monte&apos;s Rayna Synthesizers, or the like.  (and I mean<br/>&quot;synthesized&quot;, not &quot;sampled&quot;)    And, of course,  many<br/>instruments&apos; timbre-partials are stretched in this or that way.</p><p>This is why someone like La Monte Young has to go to such lengths (Rayna<br/>synthesizers,  lots of very specific instructions for his string quartet<br/>(the details of which elude me for the moment), etc.) to try to<br/>GET voice loss TO happen (i.e. Young WANTED this effect, and had to really<br/>try HARD to get it to happen . .).   Correct me if I&apos;m wrong here.</p><p>If voice loss was such a danger,  then why all this trouble on  Young&apos;s<br/>part to try to make it happen?</p><p>I would think &quot;voice loss&quot; is rarely,  if ever, a danger for the JI<br/>composer.   Most instruments just aren&apos;t that accurate.</p><p>Plus, returning to the voice loss question,  there is the effect of<br/>&quot;Streaming&quot;,  if you&apos;ve got contrapuntal lines zipping about,  even a<br/>voice DID drop out FOR REAL,  your ear would probably fill in the gap . .<br/>you might not even notice.  In this case, this would be the opposite of<br/>what Jeff Harrington claims, it would be a case of &quot;ghost voice addition&quot;<br/>rather than &quot;voice loss&quot;, as a result of existing in a JI setting.</p><p>But anyways, as I always say,  trying to find a &quot;negative&quot; reason, to NOT<br/>use a certain tuning (or other kind of musical material or methodology),<br/>is a slippery slope,  inevitably, in the end.</p><p>I should add that I have total respect for those who choose to<br/>&lt;conceptualize&gt; their music in terms of &quot;perfect&quot; JI---context always<br/>matters, and that&apos;s a quite different context from, say, 72-tet.   A<br/>given sound you could probably play for 99% of people in either tuning,<br/>and they wouldn&apos;t be able to tell the difference.  But,  in terms of the<br/>musical and formal structures that a piece in JI or 72-  engender, these<br/>can be quite possibly very different.</p><p>C Bailey</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/25/2004 4:16:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Christopher Bailey wrote:</p><p>&gt;This is why someone like La Monte Young has to go to such lengths (Rayna &gt;synthesizers,  lots of very specific instructions for his string quartet &gt;(the details of which elude me for the moment), etc.) to try to &gt;GET voice loss TO happen (i.e. Young WANTED this effect, and had to really &gt;try HARD to get it to happen . .).

La Monte has often mentioned that while the &quot;Magic Chord&quot; fits a string ensemble, the &quot;Opening Chord&quot; is music for brass instruments, so the outlines of further developments are fairly clear.  More critically, I think, it is altogether possible that the playing techniques required for some parts of the string quartet have yet to be fully developed, especially the &quot;clouds&quot;.  The articulation of the clouds in TWTP are closely tied to the composer&apos;s own playing technique, and the translation into string technique strikes me as incomplete.
