Does it sound<br/>like a piece of normal triadic common practice music, or does it<br/>sound microtonal?</p><p>To my ears it sounds pretty much like a normal triadic harmony piece unless<br/>one listens really closely, then you notice a few of the intervals are<br/>not quite as expected. Would be more noticable that it was microtonal<br/>probably if I had some complete ascending scales here and there -<br/>but I don&apos;t often play an ascending complete scale in seven equal,<br/>(that would be very &quot;chromatic&quot; in seven equal music).</p><p>I wonder how it sounds to others here?</p><p>Also, a thought I had, don&apos;t know how practical it is. But, would be<br/>nice to hear little short vignettes (or indeed longer pieces) in<br/>different styles all in the same tuning to hear what it sounds like<br/>and kind of explore the possibilities of the tuning. Maybe have<br/>a tuning of the month or something... then we all explore it a little<br/>in our various ways. (Including also finding out about existing pieces<br/>already written in the tuning).</p><p>Seven equal might be a good one to start with. Maybe those who build instruments<br/>though and tune them may get a bit left out - maybe the thing there<br/>is to make sure that some months we try out a tuning already used by an<br/>instrument maker or tuner, so they do pieces on their instrument and<br/>kind of lead the discussion and others do pieces electronically<br/>in the same tuning to compare.</p><p>Just an idea...</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=4691 href="#4691">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/26/2003 1:42:14 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d be interested to know how this sounds to others here.
