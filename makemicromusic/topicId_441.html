So maybe that&apos;s where the math comes in.</p><p>Math is useful for devising tunings with particular properties. You<br/>want a tuning that can do x, y, and z . . . how do you get it? That&apos;s<br/>an engineering problem, and often ends up being quite mathematical,<br/>with all kinds of generalizations to the problem leading to more<br/>mathematics. But once you have the tuning, and understand what it<br/>does, you&apos;re not likely to use math while composing . . . unless<br/>you&apos;re Iannis Xenakis or Brian McLaren and you&apos;re composing using<br/>some mathematical process. A lattice, though, can be very useful when<br/>composing -- except if you&apos;re using an ET, in which all the notes<br/>participate in all the same relationships with other notes.</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/9/2001 4:24:46 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;John Starrett&quot; &lt;jstarret@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; How strange! Now when I listen to it it seems to repeat every seven<br/>&gt; chords.</p><p>You are correct. I was hoping more people would listen before this<br/>was revealed. Oh well.</p><p>The reason, I believe, that both you and Joseph Pehrson heard this<br/>progression as non-repeating, is 12-tET conditioning. If you<br/>approximated these chords in 12-tET, and observed all the common<br/>tones, the progression would end up drifting a semitone every seven<br/>chords. So in a sense, your ear doesn&apos;t immediately recognize the<br/>chord progression, since it&apos;s trying to interpret it within a 12-tET<br/>grid. Although the pitch level is the same after every seven chords,<br/>your ear is a bit confused because the intervals have carried you to<br/>a place that &quot;should&quot; be different.</p><p>If the chords were exact 7-limit JI tetrads, the chord progression<br/>would drift by the ratio of 2401:2400 every seven chords. This is<br/>less than 1 cent, but is represented by 100 cents in 12-tET.</p><p>&gt; Sounds close to 31tet, sort of.</p><p>Now your familiarity with 31-tET may be kicking in -- 2401:2400 does<br/>vanish in 31-tET (as it does in 72-tET, the tuning this was actually<br/>in), so this chord progression would &quot;work&quot; in 31-tET. Also, 31-tET<br/>has the best approximations of 7-limit tetrads of any ET with fewer<br/>than 68 notes per octave -- but 72-tET is twice as good.</p></div><h3>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/9/2001 4:29:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; I can tell you this: Blackjack is a subset of 72-tET, and all the<br/>&gt; chords in this progression are the best 72-tET approximations to<br/>&gt; either 4:5:6:7 or 1/7:1/6:1/5:1/4 -- and Blackjack has a whole lot<br/>of<br/>&gt; these chords.

However, you might be a bit generous when you say &quot;most of us&quot; -- yes, there is some interest, but not on the level of daily digressions on this one or two progressions. If what you are working on is a chord progression that has some intrinsic quality but seems to be buried by other aspects (recording, etc.) and you need to get it together, then do so. And maybe you guys could correspond in a collaborative mode, and then come back and post the new sound file when you&apos;ve got something. And then go from there and take it from a chord progression to either a complete progression and backing textures/instrumental pallette, looped a few times, that others could take as a &apos;bed&apos; and put some melodies on, or maybe one of you can bite the bullet and try to do something with it yourself - there&apos;s a concept!</p><p>We are all for the process here, but I also want us to keep in mind that, for many people, looking at a raw chord progression can get somewhat tedious *if* it is not a direct path, the culmination point of said path being a form of music that people can listen to and see how it affects them. Just as we would find it tedious to have long discussions on the tools of digital recording *unless* they led to some actual results. Fortunately, that particular thread bore fruit. I want you guys to be fruit bearers too!</p><p>So...Go For It!

The *s show dissonant notes.  That&apos;s not<br/>quite as<br/>&gt; I played it: I added a passing notes between the last two chords,<br/>but they<br/>&gt; won&apos;t make any sense on the lattice.  Which is:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Db----Ab<br/>&gt;    Et/-\-B / \<br/>&gt;     /   \ /Abt\<br/>&gt;    A#----E#----B#<br/>&gt;     \ G /---D<br/>&gt;      \ /<br/>&gt;     / C#\<br/>&gt;    Eb/-\-Bb<br/>&gt;     /   \<br/>&gt;    A-----E<br/>&gt;   / \ Gb/---Db<br/>&gt;  /   \ /   / \<br/>&gt; F-----C \ /   \<br/>&gt;    D#----A#----E#<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The Abt looks like it belongs to the E3 otonality, but is in fact<br/>on the<br/>&gt; level below.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                Graham</p><p>Hi Graham!</p><p>Quite frankly, when you play these examples with a simple dotted<br/>quarter followed by an eighth, followed by a quarter note in rhythm,<br/>I get totally distracted.  The progression is much more sophisticated<br/>than that.</p><p>Could you please just play the chords &quot;straight&quot; rather than with<br/>such simplistic rhythmic &quot;elaboration...&quot; ??</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>_________ _______ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2001 7:12:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., jpehrson@r... wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@A...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/551">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/551</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks, Jon, for these Partch &quot;progressions...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He really can make something &quot;rich and strange (_Tempest)&quot; from<br/>&gt; concordances...</p><p>I really wish I could access these . . . it&apos;s one of the few websites<br/>that I always get a &quot;connection lost&quot; message from when I try to<br/>stream audio . . .
