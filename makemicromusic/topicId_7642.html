Our programs are roughly similar in transmissino<br/>rates.</p><p>It&apos;s probably going to be less than the maximum transmission<br/>rate to send a note on along the midi cable (one note<br/>per millisecond) - unless you have very fast usb midi or a<br/>very slow computer.</p><p>But that&apos;s not so bad - after all 1ms is a thousandth<br/>of a second which is pretty small -  if you play two notes on a piano<br/>a meter apart then if they are in sync for a listener<br/>to one side then they will be out of sync for a<br/>listener in front of the keyboard by 3 ms, or vice<br/>versa. Though I know that if you mix the notes over<br/>headphones or can position the microphone precisely<br/>to within inches and get the performer to perform<br/>for a listener at that exact location in space then<br/>you could get a better synchronisation than<br/>this.</p><p>It is possible to do better though. I did a<br/>program that was very bare bones retuning app<br/>which had better transmission rates. If you<br/>notice anything more than a ms or so per note<br/>then it would be a bug of some type and<br/>I&apos;d want to know about it and fix it.<br/>You can get FTS to check the latency<br/>of other programs or indeed itself to<br/>find out where the delay is happening<br/>- by relaying the notes via Midi Relay<br/>which has a fast transmission rate of<br/>0.15 ms per note on here - that would<br/>vary on your computer speed - for<br/>each midi relay in the chain. So by<br/>subtracting that known amount and doing<br/>it for a bunch of e.g. 10 notes you can<br/>find out how much latency is due to<br/>FTS or Scala, like this:</p><p>FTS Synchronisation tester -&gt; Midi Relay<br/>-&gt; Program to test -&gt; Midi Relay -&gt; FTS</p><p>- two uses of midi relay adding up to<br/>0.3 ms - then the relay through the<br/>program to test so subtract 0.3 ms from<br/>the result and you find out how much it is.</p><p>Anyway I&apos;ll be interested to know what you<br/>reckon actually trying out FTS - maybe I&apos;ve<br/>improved the latency a bit from before.<br/>I&apos;ve done work on it certainly.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
