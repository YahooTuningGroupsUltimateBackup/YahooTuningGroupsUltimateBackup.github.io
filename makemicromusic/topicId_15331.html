This one is almost 45 minutes long, and<br/>weighs in at 41MB in size, so it will take a while for my dial up<br/>friends to receive it. As always, you can subscribe at<br/><a href="http://podcast1024.libsyn.com/rss">http://podcast1024.libsyn.com/rss</a> with a podcast client, like<br/>PodcastReady or iTunes.</p><p>It includes lots of pieces posted recently on this list, including<br/>work by Aaron Johnson, Jon Smith, Margo Shulter, Dante Rosati, Hudson<br/>Lacerda, and one by me. The theme is Neo-Medieval Music, and a lot of<br/>it could have been written in 1300, in a kind of alternative history<br/>way. There&apos;s also a clip of Partch talking about the how important it<br/>is that &quot;the tongue must couple with the cavity.&quot; Sexy beast.</p><p>Thanks for listening!</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p></div>
