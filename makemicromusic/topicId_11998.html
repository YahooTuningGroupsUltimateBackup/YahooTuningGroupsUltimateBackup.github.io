You have to tell it what pitch the sample<br/>has recorded, and what pitch you want to hear, and it does the<br/>calculation to play the note at the pitch you want. It&apos;s just mathmatics.</p><p>For example, the following line of Csound code:</p><p>a3,a4 loscil 1, kcps2, ifno, ibascps</p><p>a3 and a4 are the output waveforms, left and right channel<br/>loscil is the &quot;opcode&quot; that does the work<br/>1 sets the output level to a known volume (I later change it by<br/>applying an envelope)<br/>kcps2 is the frequency that I want the note to play<br/>ifno is the number of a storage location that contains the sample in<br/>memory<br/>ibascps is the frequency recorded in the sample</p><p>There is other code around that code to determine the right sample to<br/>use, to calculate an offset in case the recorded note is out of tune<br/>(they all are), and the frequency to choose based on the tuning system.</p><p>I&apos;ve been busy creating a new set of samples based on the University<br/>of Iowa sample library, starting with a brass quintet.

It also finds out how<br/>many cents to adjust the sample so that it is in tune with 12 TET, and<br/>what the base frequency it should use. It then does a table look up to<br/>determine the desired output frequency, and generates the note. I also<br/>apply a multiplier to the frequency for things like vibrato and<br/>glissando. And an envelope. It turns out the the vibrato, glissando,<br/>and envelope are far more important to realistic sounding samples than<br/>the original samples.

There ARE<br/>physically modeled effects (like reverb), but here Prent is talking<br/>about pure PM synthesis, where the model is the origin of the<br/>sound.</p><p>There are now several commercial products using this approach.  The<br/>Yamaha VL series hardware synths, discussed previously on this list,<br/>have been around since the mid &apos;90s (and represent sort of an attempt<br/>to have another FM-like success by commercializing something from<br/>Stanford, though it doesn&apos;t seem to have worked).  The Korg OASYS PCI<br/>sound card, from the late &apos;90s (no longer produced, but maybe on<br/>ebay), had a fantastic PM electric piano (and maybe others).  I think<br/>this technology (and maybe even the patches themselves) made it in to<br/>the new OASYS super-high-end keyboard from Korg.

They&apos;re a big part of<br/>the RADIAS synth, though I&apos;m not sure PM is involved in that part.<br/>One of Wendy Carlos&apos; trademark techniques is to &quot;shape&quot; her<br/>keyboard-performed synth parts with a vocoder.  But the kind of<br/>flexibility given by PM in something like String Studio, where<br/>(say) MIDI velocity can be used to control the amount of energy<br/>driven into the string/resonator (and the materials of the string<br/>and resonator can be specified in more or less real time) is<br/>simply another level beyond that.</p><p>-Carl</p><p>&gt;&gt; So where would one find information on what would be good values to<br/>&gt;&gt; apply?
