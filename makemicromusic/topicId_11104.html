Here&apos;s what I gave them for<br/>feedback:</p><p>&quot;<br/>I dunno... I don&apos;t really feel the stimuli were appropriate.<br/>Apparently too broad.  Test one hypothesis at a time.</p><p>And the &quot;sample&quot; trial in part 3 was definitely inappropriate.</p><p>The synthesis was positively annoying.  Sounds like an MT-32.</p><p>I don&apos;t doubt that Western tonal music exploits universal human<br/>perceptual tendencies, though of course this would be nice to test.<br/>It would also be nice to test if various indigenous musics do too.</p><p>-Carl<br/>&quot;</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
