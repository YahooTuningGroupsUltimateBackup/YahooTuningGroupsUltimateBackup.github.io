You certainly took a different angle than I thought of: instead of files with (roughly) equivalent fidelity but differing lengths, you offer complete movements (pieces) by utilizing differing factors of compression, as you so aptly put &quot;lo-fi&quot; and &quot;hi-fi&quot;. Not a comparison of the codecs, but that isn&apos;t what you intended anyhow.</p><p>I listened to the 3rd movement of the Haydn and - no surprise - the ogg (hi-fi) version sounds much better, having better frequency range.</p><p>I *would* suggest that you lay it out a little more tabular, as the lo/hi-fi selections bump right up against one another, and may not be totally intuitive. If nothing else, put some space in there (even a blank.gif with a width of something uniform).</p><p>And then there is the &quot;I suggest just listening to the music without fussing about &quot;correct&quot; soundfonts&quot;... This suggests that music is nothing more than pitches and notes of varying lengths and volumes, as if composers never really cared about what timbral resource might be utilized. I understand your point, and we have never seen eye-to-eye (or eye-to-anything, for that matter :).</p><p>But since some recent discussions around here have toyed with the philosophy that the rendered/recorded sounds utilized in a lot of our electronic microtonal stuff has a lot to do with it&apos;s semi-lameness, I can only offer this: one of the things that good composers things about is *everything*. I realize that there are areas of music where performance can vary a lot in terms of instrumental/vocal resources (and I&apos;m *specifically* not referring to _transcriptions_), but a composition is the sum of its parts, and the scoring of the piece - the way that it becomes sound from dots on a page, etc - can be just as important as the rhythms and pitches.</p><p>I can only speak for myself: I experience music holistically. I listen as much to the phrasing, to the &apos;orchestration&apos; (if you will), to the mix (in recorded situations), as much as I do to melody, harmony, and rhythm. How could one not? (strictly rhetorical)</p><p>All of that _said_, I didn&apos;t find the soundfont objectionable, and it was at least as good as most &apos;arco&apos; string sounds that you find on good synths or samplers. However, even if one leaves out real string playing, there is a huge world of music that can be made with string sample libraries, but it requires one to use many kinds of samples and to really understand the phrasing of a string player as exhibited in the writing of the piece. I&apos;ve heard very, very effective mock-ups of works using samplers, but it requires a lot of work to get the sound right.</p><p>Going back, you might look at the html layout of a couple of the music sites (like zebox, soundclick, etc) for how they spreadout the various sound file formats for downloading/streaming, to make your page more clear...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=7645 href="#7645">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/28/2004 11:05:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

I said that the soundfont didn&apos;t bother me too much, and that is because it is a decent emulation of an arco string note, with a fair amount of bow attack. I didn&apos;t say anything about *not* using them - if you read carefully, you&apos;ll note that I mention that successful use of samples in emulating an complex instrument (in this case, and most notably, string articulations) requires not one kind of sample but many. The variety of attack envelopes and nuances in the phrasing of a bow are numerous and have a great degree of impact on how that phrasing creates a musical line. All one need do is take a look at the score, or even better, study a string player performing such a part, to see that one kind of sample will not give an effective rendition of a well composed line.</p><p>&gt;Where do ideas fit in?</p><p>Obviously, they are also part of the whole.</p><p>&gt;It sounds like something which would make a great course--how to produce a &gt;Hollywood mock-up.</p><p>There have only been two string quartets that went by the name of the Hollywood String Quartet.

But<br/>then you notice, you can sing it,  you can play it,  it sounds good<br/>when you sing it and play it.  The voices fit into typical<br/>instrumental ranges:  flute, oboe, violin, etc.   They don&apos;t just<br/>wander willy-nilly all over the staff.</p><p>I remember as a student writing fugues--this was a problem:  my<br/>fugues would be technically correct, but nobody could sing them<br/>because there was never a time to breathe, and the range was too<br/>wide, etc. etc.</p><p>You don&apos;t always notice Bach solving these &quot;mere<br/>instrumental/orchestrational&quot; problems, but he is.</p><p>I should also say that one of the things I love about Bach&apos;s music<br/>(and I prefer Bach greatly over Mozart and Beethoven) is the SOUND of<br/>it,  when played on &quot;authentic&quot; instruments . . .the sounds that<br/>Bach heard.  He WAS writing for the instruments of his day, in very<br/>sophisticated and subtle ways, that aren&apos;t obvious on the score.</p><p>But there are certain ways of playing those instruments that are<br/>very expressive, or have very clear characters, and Bach takes<br/>advantage of this in his music.

Either the<br/>music&apos;s not quite fitting the timbre, or the other way around.<br/>What I suggested the other day, was to think in terms of the former,<br/>rather than always starting with the latter.</p><p>BTW,  I agree with Gene that BPO of Beethoven is not so great.  I<br/>really can only stand Beethoven (at least,  the symphonies), with<br/>authentic timbres, and authentic tunings, both.
