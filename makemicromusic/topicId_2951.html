Yet it should be so utterly easy to at least make the<br/>programs read their frequency tables from a file!</p><p>I&apos;ve done a bit of work with VAZ2001. It&apos;s OK for weird sounds, but I<br/>don&apos;t much like the analog model, or the poor envelope control. I have been<br/>thinking of getting either Absynth or VAZ modular (which is tunable).<br/>Absynth sounds fairly useless for microtonal work... Anyone have experience<br/>with VAZ modular? Is it fully tunable? Can it be easily used to do<br/>high-quality FM synthesis? I&apos;m most comfortable with FM, being a TX802 user<br/>for so many years...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=2984 href="#2984">ðŸ”—</a>Alexandros Papadopoulos &#x3C;alexmoog@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/16/2002 3:21:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well , I have an early version of Absynth that came from a company other<br/>than Native Instruments. NI must have bought it later.<br/>It has 20-30  pre-programmed scales , I don&apos;t remember exactly which<br/>since I have uninstalled it . As far as I remember it has just scales<br/>some ET from 22 , 31 to 72 , farabi , Carlos and others.<br/>I don&apos;t have the NI version but it seems identical from the<br/>screenshots , so I believe the tuning capabilities are the same I  fear.</p><p>On Thursday, May 16, 2002, at 02:50 PM, jacky_ligon wrote:</p><p>&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., Alexandros Papadopoulos &lt;alexmoog@o...&gt;<br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Absynth has some microtonal scales as presets , you cannot tune<br/>&gt; your own.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well - that would qualify it as 100% useless. Makes one wonder what<br/>&gt; there selection of the chosen few tunings were.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Too bad and thanks for the info Alexandros.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The only alternative for using these things in a truly microtonal<br/>&gt; manner, where you can tune up what you desire is to use FTS - and<br/>&gt; even here, the synth must be multi-timbral in order to play chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s some great synthesis tools out there with these softsynths,<br/>&gt; however some of the ones I like the most are not multi-timbral, so<br/>&gt; FTS can only make them useful for monophonic lines.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do think I remember Ab(ysmal)synth being multi-timbral though, so<br/>&gt; one could still use the pitch-bend paradigm.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So far the only softsynth I&apos;ve seen which really makes all this<br/>&gt; relatively easy to do is VAZ.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Strange - one would think that this new technology would allow more<br/>&gt; freedom, but alas, the reality is that we are as locked out with this<br/>&gt; stuff, for the most part, as much as hardware gear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah - the sadness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [MMM info]-------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; More music files from MMM are at <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music/">http://www.microtonal.org/music/</a><br/>&gt; -------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
