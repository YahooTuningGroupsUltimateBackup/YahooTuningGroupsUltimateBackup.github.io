I was hired to explore<br/>&gt;improvisation and composition with 5-10 yr. olds at the Fayerweather Street<br/>&gt;School in Cambridge.  They were kids who don&apos;t consider themselves<br/>&gt;&apos;musicians&apos; -- this was just their required daily music class.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The first week we did &apos;directed&apos; improvisation -- I had them choose three<br/>&gt;sounds and work with those materials - I cued some events, but the goal<br/>&gt;was<br/>&gt;to have them get comfortable with creating forms/sounds themselves<br/>&gt;intuitively.  It could be argued that I also &apos;composed&apos; by setting out<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt;array of instruments to be used, although they chose what they wanted to<br/>&gt;play from those available instruments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I also talked to them about expanding the definition of music, using<br/>&gt;crickets, rain and birds as examples of &apos;non music&apos; music.  After that,<br/>&gt;we<br/>&gt;were quiet for a minute (yes, they actually kept quiet) and listened for<br/>&gt;sounds in the room that they liked.  Then we did a piece where they mimicked<br/>&gt;those sounds -- (Jacob and other ex-members of the GIE might remember a<br/>&gt;&apos;grown up&apos; version of this &apos;exercise&apos;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The second week I played some of mine and Braxton&apos;s graphic and mixed<br/>&gt;graphic notation (his new &apos;poetic notation&apos;, which is really cool) and<br/>&gt;had<br/>&gt;them write pieces using notation of their own invention.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Perhaps it&apos;s on topic with the eternal comp/improv debate.  Perhaps not.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It was a great experience, and the recorded results have been posted by<br/>&gt;the<br/>&gt;school on the web here:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<a href="http://www.fayerweather.org/summertime_rb.htm">http://www.fayerweather.org/summertime_rb.htm</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;click on &quot;summertime music 2003&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;The first 6 pieces are 5 yr. olds , #7-9 were 6-8 yr. olds, and #10-16<br/>&gt;were<br/>&gt;mostly 10 yr. olds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I hope more of us try to work our way into the schools, especially with<br/>&gt;little kids, because they are so open minded at that point.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Anyway, enjoy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Andrew<br/>&gt;</p><p>&quot;The artist is a receptacle for the emotions that come from all over the<br/>place: from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape,<br/>from a spider&apos;s web.&quot; - Pablo Picasso</p><p>---<br/>Hanuman Zhang, musical mad scientist</p><p> &quot;Welcome and explore and inquire into everything, new or old, that comes<br/>your way, and then build your own music on whatever your inner life has been able<br/>to take in and offer you back again.&quot; - Henry Cowell</p><p>&quot;Music is by no means like the other arts, namely a copy of the Ideas, but a<br/>copy of the will itself, the objectivity of which are the Ideas. For this<br/>reason, the effect of music is so very much more powerful and penetrating than is<br/>that of the other arts, for these others speak only of the shadow, but music<br/>of the essence.&quot; - Schopenhauer, _The World as Will and Representation_</p><p>&quot;His music, far from being in the background of my life, was in the<br/>foreground.  It was he as a musician who accomplished what I dreamed of, and<br/>I followed as well as I could with the inferior power of words.  The ear is<br/>purer than the eye, which reads only relative meaning into words. Whereas<br/>the distillation of experience into pure sound, a state of music, is<br/>timeless and absolute.&quot; -Anais Nin on her brother Joaquin Nin-Culmell</p><p>&quot;...improvisation is about change, about flux rather than stasis. ...<br/>improvisation is about a constant change.&quot; - Steve Beresford</p><p>improvisation: &quot;a process of liberation, a working around the assumptions<br/>that define our civilization, and the results are open-ended.&quot; - John Berndt<br/>Improvisation resists documentation - it celebrates the ephemeral, it<br/>perversely reminds us every second that everything dies. Much of the &quot;modern<br/>Westernized world&quot; isn&apos;t ready for this kind of news.</p><p>&gt; &gt;&quot;Any sufficiently advanced music is indistinguishable from noise&quot;</p><p>&gt; &gt;(after Arthur C. Clarke&apos;s aphorism that any sufficiently advanced</p><p>&gt; &gt;technology is indistinguisable from magic.)&quot; - John Chalmers, in email<br/>response<br/>to the quote _The Difference between Music and Noise is all in your Head_</p></div>
