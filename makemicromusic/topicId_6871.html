I heard a Good Humor ice-cream truck<br/>approach with a fantastically warped/broken sounding set of ice-cream chimes.</p><p>I wish I had a sample of it to share with you. But it basically sounded<br/>magical in it&apos;s severe out-of-tuneness. It sounded like we were all in an<br/>Yves Tanguy painting, buying ice cream from some kind of Willa Wonka type<br/>person. Or that gumby himself was going to serve us up some soft serve.</p><p>It made me think: I like things that sound like they are &apos;broken&apos;. Like that<br/>ice cream trucks chimes. Like electronic circuits that are chaotically wired.<br/>Like the &apos;wrong note&apos; aesthetic of Prokofieff, Stravinsky, Honegger, Milhaud.<br/>I also imagined a sort of never before heard insect like music that had a<br/>mechanical clarity, but then the &apos;brokeness&apos; came from someone stepping on<br/>that insect...</p><p>But I have to tell you, the ice cream truck beat &apos;em all. It&apos;s something I&apos;ll<br/>never forget in my life. I swear it could inspire a whole movement in music<br/>towards the sweetly macabre xentonal !!!!</p><p>Best,<br/>--<br/>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=6872 href="#6872">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2004 11:11:20 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.
