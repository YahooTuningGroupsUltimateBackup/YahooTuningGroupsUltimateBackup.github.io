A<br/>&gt; couple of months ago I had a peculiar dream where I came face-to-face<br/>&gt; with the &quot;lyme entity&quot;; no not the actual clinical microscopic spiral<br/>&gt; thing, but rather a strange abandoned Indian&apos; canoe floating in a<br/>&gt; narrow river in a deep forest. On the canoe was an oddly painted<br/>&gt; symbol/glyph , which I at once understood to be the &quot;lyme&quot; . And in<br/>&gt; this dream there was no resolve or tidy end, just a symbolic and very<br/>&gt; resonant encounter with some deeply-rooted facet of one&apos;s context/<br/>&gt; condition. And if there was any message/meaning in the dream, it was<br/>&gt; that the lyme was an active entity.....a living thing in its own<br/>&gt; agenda ,one quite apart from mine, but not necessarily intentionally<br/>&gt; malignant.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Over the last few months I&apos;ve been working on a piece for Jacob<br/>&gt; Barton&apos;s ambitious 17-tone concert series. FWIW, I like 17-tone and<br/>&gt; think it&apos;s a very easy EDO to write in, but above and beyond that,<br/>&gt; and not so surprisingly I suppose ,I wrote a piece that deals with<br/>&gt; these topics (lyme, etc, albeit in an equally oblique way as the<br/>&gt; dream). I&apos;m still not sure if the piece will be played or nor, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; not so user/performance-friendly on a short notice , but I know Jacob<br/>&gt; is a get-it-done kind of guy, so I have faith and if it&apos;s meant to<br/>&gt; be, so be it, and if not, so be that.
