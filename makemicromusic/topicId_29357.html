I have not been active on MMM since my last microtonal concert in 2007 UKM2 Microfest, since I was busy completing my research.  I followed many of your list mails in the past and I was surprised to find out you are in Japan.  In which city do you live?  I was thinking to organise a microfest in Osaka and have plenty of microtonal instruments and the Osaka Ongaku Daigaku supporting me.</p><p>Best</p><p>Tony</p></div><h3><a id=29358 href="#29358">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forr&#xF3; &#x3C;danforcz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2014 9:17:17 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi, Tony,</p><p>I answer you in PM...</p><p>Daniel</p><p>On 20 Oct, 2014, at 1:05 PM, &apos;J.A.Martin Salinas&apos; tony@...
