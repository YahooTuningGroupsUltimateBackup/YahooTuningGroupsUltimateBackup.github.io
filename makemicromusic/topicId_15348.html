This is an accomplishment that directly parallels<br/>Larry Coryell and John McLaughlin enriching the jazz guitar lexicon by<br/>embracing the innovations of Jimi Hendrix, but in this case hardly<br/>anyone seemed to notice and few would follow suit. That doesn&apos;t<br/>diminish the accomplishment, however. Not one bit.</p><p>Jon Catler&apos;s playing on the Catler Bros. &quot;Crash Landing&quot; is a similar<br/>accomplishment. Catler is the first guitarist to bring Just Intonation<br/>to jazz guitar. And like Torn, he too ups the ante with style and verve.</p><p>Catler has been developing his very personal approach to microtonality<br/>since he was a student at Berklee College of Music in the late 70s.<br/>He&apos;s a member of the legendary La Monte Young&apos;s Forever Bad Blues Band<br/>he recently had his &quot;Evolution for Electric Guitar and Orchestra&quot;<br/>recorded with Grammy award winning conductor Joel Thome.</p><p>The Catler Bros. is a trio made up of (what else) brothers Jon and<br/>Brad Catler and drummer Jonathan Kane. The music is a stripped down,<br/>raw and punchy jazz-rock with a compositional aesthetic somewhat<br/>reminiscent of early Ornette.</p><p>On &quot;Crash Landing&quot; Catler primarily plays a Schecter Strat that<br/>utilizes a 49-tone just intonation tuning system of his own design,<br/>and the effect of hearing this tuning is somewhat akin to suddenly<br/>seeing alarmingly vivid colors that you never knew existed. Catler&apos;s a<br/>gifted, classy player too, and his measured yet forceful work on<br/>&quot;Crash Landing&quot; often suggests some prismatic mean of Ornette Coleman<br/>and Jeff Beck.</p><p>Jazz guitar doesn&apos;t have to pretend that everything post-Hendrix never<br/>happened. But it really doesn&apos;t matter either: &quot;Crash Landing&quot; is a<br/>landmark recording with or without the recognition.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/11/2006 11:09:14 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 09:45 AM 12/11/2006, you wrote:<br/>&gt;Every so often something sneaks in under the radar undetected and no<br/>&gt;one seems to notice that a paradigm shift has occurred... that<br/>&gt;someone&apos;s seriously upped the collective ante.</p><p>I noticed.  It&apos;s one of my top five favorite microtonal albums...<br/>has been since its release in 1997.  Easily the best of Catler&apos;s<br/>stuff.  A link to buy it was on my home page for upwards of 5 years.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
