One of the singularly killer musical events of my life was hearing Jack De Johnette do a solo piano version in the middle of one of his concerts. Devastating.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/28/2006 12:00:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 10:37 AM 10/28/2006, you wrote:<br/>&gt;I&apos;m having fun with the song Naima, by John Coltrane on my Bumper<br/>&gt;Music Podcast site.
