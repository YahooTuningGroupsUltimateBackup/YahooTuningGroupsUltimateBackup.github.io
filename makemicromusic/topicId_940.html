For those that don&apos;t know, X wrote some number of pieces for a percussion group &quot;L&apos;Percussion de Strausbourg&quot;, and because of difficulty and other factors, don&apos;t get that many performances.</p><p>Here in San Diego, the world-renowned Steven Schick draws incredible graduate percussionists to UCSD, and a couple of years ago the cream of the crop, known as &quot;red fish blue fish&quot; did all the X sextets, and then did a recording in the UC &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; studio, and mixed down to 5.1 surround (don&apos;t know which competing version of surround).</p><p>I heard some of the mixdown, and it was astonishing, in no small part because X specifies, for at least some of the pieces, that the 6 percussion stations surround the audience (and they needed click tracks to coordinate the separate metrical scenarios).</p><p>Perfect blending of music and technology. Very fun, very involving. If you can ever do it -- and especially knowing your great taste in exploring the &apos;physical&apos; placement of sounds in the sound stage, you&apos;ll be a master at it!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
