I must add, though, and to both lists, that I am a<br/>little disappointed to be casually told that the &quot;practical&quot; side of<br/>tuning has moved over t/here now, as though that were a predictable<br/>and perfectly unobjectionable development with no ramifications. I<br/>have a few thoughts about the change that I feel moved to share, with<br/>no offense intended to anyone, and I hope none will be taken.</p><p>Some years ago my predecessors at Bard renamed the music department<br/>the &quot;Making Music Program&quot; (shades of MMM!) in defiance of the<br/>administration&apos;s attempts to turn it into a history/theory<br/>department. Only last week I fought off yet another attempt to make<br/>theory and history central, and to relegate the performance and<br/>composition faculty to basically adjunct status. Institutions<br/>endemically tend toward a gradual shift from art to theory. It&apos;s<br/>difficult to pinpoint how this happens, though not hard to find<br/>excuses for. Art is a demanding mistress, and artists have little<br/>time for organization (or continual e-mail postings). Organization of<br/>hierarchies and structures requires the same kind of analytical mind<br/>that theorists must have by definition, and they take to it like<br/>ducks to water. Theory and history can always prove themselves with<br/>arguments and facts, and always seem so respectable; artists can<br/>never prove what they&apos;re doing, and are always so vulnerable. The<br/>great stone walls of theory always get built eventually, and the<br/>tender seedlings of art get trampled underfoot in the process. And as<br/>stone walls multiply, the wilderness of the mind that art both needs<br/>and represents gets pushed further away from the city.</p><p>And so, when the great composers who taught in academia in the &apos;70s<br/>(like Johnston, Martirano, Feldman) retired, the status-conscious<br/>departments of the &apos;80s replaced them with theorists. _Perspectives<br/>of New Music_ was begun by composers, Ben Boretz and J.K. Randall,<br/>and for the last several years has been edited by a consortium of<br/>theorists. Of course, one notices that when the theorists came, the<br/>Midwestern university music departments died as hotbeds of<br/>experimental musical activity. _Perspectives_ ceased to be an<br/>exciting journal of new ideas when the theorists took over. Not that<br/>I have anything against theory (hell, I&apos;m the only member of the<br/>music faculty who carries a pocket calculator, and even *uses* it in<br/>class), but without the unpredictable, irrational spark of<br/>creativity, theory tends to lie there on the table like the patient<br/>that didn&apos;t pull through. On the other other side, artists need<br/>theory, too - though, in my view, not very much of it, just a dash<br/>here and there to push their work forward, not enough to straitjacket<br/>it.</p><p>If the tuning list had split into just intonation versus various<br/>equal temperaments, I would have thought, &quot;Well, that seems<br/>unnecessary, but not harmful: each of those areas of inquiry can<br/>continue independently of the other.&quot; But a split between theory and<br/>practical creativity doesn&apos;t strike me as so innocent - especially<br/>because it suggests that the tuning list is subject to the same<br/>forces that operate in academia and other inherently conservative<br/>institutions. If we here, of all places, can&apos;t understand that theory<br/>and creativity are an interconnected yin and yang, needing each other<br/>to remain lively, who on the planet will? For god&apos;s sake, how can<br/>artistic creativity keep any meaningful foothold in society when it<br/>can&apos;t even keep a foothold in the *tuning list*?</p><p>Just a thought. I&apos;m too much of a southerner to play Abraham Lincoln.<br/>I&apos;ll secede with MMM, and I already find more of interest over t/here<br/>than I have on the tuning list in recent months. But perhaps that in<br/>itself shows how much the tuning list has to lose. I&apos;m afraid, in<br/>short, that at MMM I won&apos;t find the occasional glimpses of bizarre<br/>theory that fire my imagination - and that the tuning list, without<br/>art-talk, will become impenetrable.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Kyle Gann</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=5999 href="#5999">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

I, for my part, do not consider it a good idea to see<br/>theory and practice as adversaries, or even to play them out against<br/>each other. They are both useful and necessary - you just need to<br/>know the appropriate place of each. An artist who lets his or her<br/>creativity be buried under theory will, from my part, fall under<br/>suspicion of not having understood something about this<br/>appropriateness and will not get much of my pity.<br/>--<br/>Hans Straub<br/><a href="http://home.datacomm.ch/straub">http://home.datacomm.ch/straub</a></p></div><h3><a id=6003 href="#6003">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/13/2004 12:07:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey Kyle...

I sympathize with you strongly about this yin and<br/>yang, and never saw it any other way.</p><p>There was never a single suggestion that practical creativity was off-<br/>topic on the tuning list. There was never a complaint on the tuning<br/>list that someone there was posting too much about practice and not<br/>enough about theory. What happened, I think, was that some theorists<br/>were overly zealous in their desire to *explain* theory to people who<br/>didn&apos;t want to think about it, to *discuss* theory with people who<br/>didn&apos;t really want to go deeper than mere numerology, and to *apply*<br/>theory to this or that idea when the originator of the idea would<br/>have been happier had it gone unanalyzed. However, not one of the<br/>overly zealous theorists, nor anyone else on the tuning list, ever<br/>explicitly discouraged, meant to discourage, or wanted to discourage,<br/>any amount of posting on practical matters, sharing of music, etc. It<br/>might have been more of the &quot;walls&quot; effect you were mentioning. As a<br/>professional musician in many genres, I know it well, but<br/>unfortunately it&apos;s a lot more apparent when you&apos;re the victim than<br/>when you&apos;re the unintentional perpetrator.</p><p>Meanwhile, before the creation of the MakeMicroMusic list, two theory<br/>threads had already been willfully driven off the tuning list -- one<br/>led to the creation of the harmonic entropy list, and the other led<br/>to the creation of the tuning-math list. As I recall, the<br/>MakeMicroMusic list was one of two resurrections of the short-lived<br/>Practical Microtonality list. The initial formation of the PM list<br/>came a surprise to many of us because there was never any indication<br/>that anyone on the tuning list wouldn&apos;t have welcomed *more* posting<br/>on practical matters, sharing of music, etc. And in fact the latter<br/>have always been and continue to be part and parcel of the tuning<br/>list, though not always in the proportion everyone would have liked.</p><p>There are a lot of myths about what the tuning list was like in<br/>the &quot;good old days&quot;. It&apos;s easy enough to see for yourself -- go to</p><p><a href="http://www.mills.edu/LIFE/CCM/ftp/tuning/list/archive/">http://www.mills.edu/LIFE/CCM/ftp/tuning/list/archive/</a></p><p>and pick a folder at random.

Those who didn&apos;t want to think<br/>about theory had every right not to think about theory, and were in<br/>no way inferior to those who did.</p><p>Analyzing is not superior to leaving unanalyzed. I didn&apos;t mean to<br/>imply that it was. The creative mind, it&apos;s often said (with good<br/>reason), is stymied by analysis, unless the analysis occurs very far<br/>away from the creativity.</p><p>But yes, I do believe that in some cases, when one is intentionally<br/>using numbers in the first place to shape one&apos;s tuning materials, as<br/>for example in JI or temperament, quantitative reasoning can be more<br/>useful than unreasoned numerical manipulation. I also believe that<br/>quantitative considerations that make contact with the realities of<br/>how we hear can be more useful than those that derive from other<br/>sources. Those skilled and knowledgeable in these areas feel a<br/>compulsion to share their knowledge and reasoning so as to benefit,<br/>and further the endeavors of, others. The goal is to help along, in<br/>any way they can, the creation of microtonal music.</p><p>Often this works fine -- sometimes, brilliantly. But often, the<br/>result is negative. There are various reasons for this. And this<br/>can&apos;t helped by the usually dry tone of those doing the offering.</p><p>Nevertheless, I respect and have always respected anyone&apos;s right to<br/>use &quot;mere&quot; numerology for musical ends -- I have no problem with<br/>that. Once this intention is made clear, I don&apos;t bother this person<br/>with quantitative reasoning or psychoacoustical touchstones anymore,<br/>because I know these won&apos;t be matters of interest.</p><p>Is it remotely possible for me to see why someone would perceive the<br/>above as being &quot;couched in superiority&quot;? Yes, it is. But after all<br/>the time you and I have spend working through these things, I had<br/>hoped that someone wouldn&apos;t be you.</p><p>I accept full responsibility, though.

Something about the written<br/>word vs. a combination of speech and body language, I suppose.</p><p>&gt; &gt;However, not one of the overly zealous theorists, nor anyone else<br/>on the<br/>&gt; &gt;tuning list, ever explicitly discouraged, meant to discourage, or<br/>wanted<br/>&gt; &gt;to discourage,<br/>&gt; &gt;any amount of posting on practical matters, sharing of music, etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I believe Rick put it fairly well: many people simply didn&apos;t want<br/>to sit<br/>&gt; through thousands of words on theoretical matters.</p><p>I wish Rick had put it &quot;remotely&quot; that well.

I<br/>joined &quot;MMM&quot; a few months ago, then &quot;tuning&quot;.

It was annoying.</p><p>MMM is pleasant.  People here support one another.  They share music, not<br/>numbers.  I can keep up with it.

I don&apos;t<br/>contribute to the tuning list often but I rarely go three days<br/>without perusing it. I had noticed almost nothing but arcane number<br/>talk for the past several months, which always happened from time to<br/>time, but I didn&apos;t realize that others were thinking of the change as<br/>a permanent one. A few replies to specific points:</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante@i...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;  All you need to do to heal the split is to have your email program send all<br/>&gt;  the email from the various tuning groups into one folder called....<br/>&gt;  &quot;tuning&quot;. Voila- no more split. If you instead read the groups at the<br/>&gt;  website, well, then you must be a glutton for Yahoo advert punishment.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Dante</p><p>That&apos;s true to a point - but what I thought was fertile about the<br/>tuning list was the way it swerved wildly back and forth between<br/>theory and composition/performance, so that each interpenetrated the<br/>other, a thread about numbers bleeding into one about a compositional<br/>issue and vice versa. That&apos;s what I&apos;m going to miss, the friction<br/>between them, the occasional irruptions of creative insight in the<br/>midst of number theory. A group of theory wonks just comparing cent<br/>tables won&apos;t be nearly so interesting to look into.</p><p>&gt;  2. I would look forward to the day that MMM is unnecessary. I am, however<br/>&gt;  (in addition to my messy, chaotic, emotional artistic side) a<br/>&gt;pragmatic person.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  Cheers,<br/>&gt;  Jon</p><p>I too am pragmatic - almost to a fault, I think, the result of having<br/>been a feckless visionary in my youth. And so I&apos;m here.</p><p>&gt;  I&apos;ve looked upon the split as not so much one between theory and practice<br/>&gt;  as between (A) a nasty name-calling environment full of endless pointless<br/>&gt;  theorizing with a dash of occasional pointers to musical examples, and (B)<br/>&gt;  an environment of people who just wanted to share the non-12 music they&apos;re<br/>&gt;  actually working on, with a dash of methods &amp; tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&#x9;Rick</p><p>This is helpful - and is the way I will hereafter look at it.</p><p>&gt;  There was never a single suggestion that practical creativity was off-<br/>&gt;  topic on the tuning list. There was never a complaint on the tuning<br/>&gt;  list that someone there was posting too much about practice and not<br/>&gt;  enough about theory.</p><p>I&apos;m sure this is true. But I did feel this week just a little, though<br/>it probably wasn&apos;t meant this way, like I had wandered into the<br/>tuning list for the first time in months and was told, &quot;Oh, your kind<br/>has to go down the road to this other list now.&quot; Like dropping into<br/>your old neighborhood bar and the clientele has changed, and the<br/>officious doorman points his thumb at the little bar down on the<br/>other side of the tracks where your friends are now.
