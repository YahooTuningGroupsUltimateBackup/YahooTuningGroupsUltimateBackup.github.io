But you can also hear their resulting combination--which would often (always?) priviledge the lower key, since we hear harmonic identity from the bass up.  Music is rich, why say that it&apos;s GOT to be one of the other (2 keys, vs. 1 key with lots of wierd stuff on top)?</p><p>When I was writing my piano sonata (which I now have a live performance of which I&apos;ll be posting soon),  the development section of the first movement was a long stream of bitonality . . and I carefully considered the combined effect of the two streams at any given point.  I think Carl&apos;s example of Bb Major atop E Major. . . I thought &quot;yeah, that&apos;s gonna sound dominant-y,  a very rich E-dominant chord with #5, b9, etc. etc.&quot; .. so I used that combination (actually it was G with C# up above) at the end of the development, for a powerful dominant leading back to the recap.</p><p>********</p><p>Another way of thinking about bitonality was suggested to me by a passage from Schoenberg (from the 1st string quartet (which is &quot;tonal&quot;)), and another passage from a Bach chorale.</p><p>The Schoenberg example is a sudden, slow chorale of sorts, played sul ponticello by the quartet, in the 3rd movement (slow movement).  You can&apos;t miss it.</p><p>The first and last chords are e minor,  and there&apos;s a bunch of wierd chormatically related triads in between, and so you can hear it as sorta in e minor.  But the top melody line goes B---D-C#-B---C#-D-C#-B---, which sounds like it&apos;s in b minor.  You really can hear the passage in either &apos;key&apos; . . .to my ear it&apos;s a much more subtle way of being &quot;bitonal&quot; than just writing some dissonant counterpoint in 2 different keys on top of one another---in this case,  different elements of ONE inseparable wad of music point to one key or the other.</p><p>However, dissonant counterpoint is fun too.</p><p>C Bailey</p></div>
