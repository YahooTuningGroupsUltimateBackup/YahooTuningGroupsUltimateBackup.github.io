It is played upon a &quot;recycled&quot; vibraphone. Using a scale called Meta-Slendro by theorist Erv Wilson, it attempts to create beating patterns in various places. This is symbolic of the &quot;awakening of spirits&quot; thought to live primarily in the upper corners of rooms.</p><p>{with live two handed drawing by Sayo Mitsuishi}</p><p>John Brumit and Wayne Grim &lt;<a href="http://www.bayimproviser.com/artistdetail.asp?artist_id=191">http://www.bayimproviser.com/artistdetail.asp?artist_id=191</a>&gt;<br/>John Brumit will be designing a keyboard that utilizes replaceable &quot;tines&quot; made of site-specific found objects, while Wayne Grim &lt;<a href="http://www.bayimproviser.com/artistdetail.asp?artist_id=191">http://www.bayimproviser.com/artistdetail.asp?artist_id=191</a>&gt; will be designing a stringed instrument made from found wood, metal, and plastic with sympathetic drone strings. The instrument will be played through an array of speakers which are tuned to resonate with specific frequencies. The entire composition will interact with a flashing marquis sign whose on-off pulses control current flowing to other electronic devices.</p><p>Eric Roth<br/>&quot;Bible Thumpin&iuml;&iquest;&half; V, is a new composition for three performers, each with a cloth-bound bible, treated as the musical instrument it inexorably is. Bibles are made and infused with historical, cultural, political, ethical, and moral meanings by humans (no matter the considered origin of the prime ancestor of modern bibles). This piece endeavors to project musical meaning onto the Bible, as others project other kinds of meaning into the Bible&iuml;&iquest;&half;both through analysis/interpretation and supposition. I use bibles to contextualize the raw materials they provide and to serve my chosen purposes, for which I implicitly take responsibility.&quot;</p><p>Emily Hay will perform an original composed and improvised musical work entitled &quot;Bent&quot;. It will feature voice, percussion, and amplified metal objects; processed through electronics. Hay is a Los Angeles based flutist and vocalist who specializes in free improvisation and contemporary music. She will be accompanied by trombonist Kurt Heyl.<br/>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div>
