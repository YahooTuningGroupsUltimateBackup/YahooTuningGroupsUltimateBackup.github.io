But, regarding &gt;digital audio, what can it do that _Samplitude_ cannot or vice versa??</p><p>Just a couple of nights ago I downloaded the Sonar demo as well, and have worked a little with it. Additionally, I downloaded Samplitude a couple of weeks ago (you may recall this is one of the apps that I tested Ozone in).</p><p>After having worked with them, and having been a Cakewalk user for sequencing needs since Version 2.0, I would say this:</p><p>- Samplitude looks to be a digital audio, multi-track workstation with the ability to work with MIDI added.</p><p>- Sonar looks like a legacy sequencer with audio recording capabilities added.</p><p>The lines get blurred these days because of what? Plug-ins. Both can utilize DirectX plugins, so the same Noise Reduction or Reverb plugin would be useable in both. And therefore the question becomes: which front-end, which basic program do you feel more comfortable working in, and to answer that you need to answer &quot;Just what do I want to do with this?&quot;</p><p>- If you still want to do primarily sequencing, with maybe doing a little digital audio stuff, Sonar may be your best bet, as there are still a lot of MIDI manipulation tools left over from the Cakewalk days (sophisticated quantization, note shifting, etc.)</p><p>- If you want to have something that functions as a sequencer or can import your MIDI files, but you primarily want to record the output or add acoustic instruments and then do mixdowns, something like Samplitude would likely be much better.</p><p>Hopefully we&apos;ll have people on the list that have real time with these programs in a project sense, or that know the 2 fields well enough to offer more depth of opinion. That&apos;s how these two struck me, as compared to sequencers and DAW&apos;s that I&apos;ve been using for a while...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=2485 href="#2485">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson2 &#x3C;jpehrson@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/2/2002 12:40:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.

It&apos;s rather rare<br/>that I can do *anything* related to sound or music at this place, so<br/>this was nice for a change.</p><p>What they want to recommend for a client is something to record and<br/>archive both spoken materials and music.  It&apos;s basically a<br/>*recording* application they need.</p><p>According to your description, in this case it would seem that<br/>_Samplitude_ or something similar would be the best bet for them.</p><p>Now as to SONAR, this is more for my *own* investigation, since I<br/>have been happy with my current sequencer but just wanted to know<br/>what&apos;s *out there* and, also, wanted to investigate the most updated<br/>version of *Cakewalk* which it appears this is.  Why?  Well, mostly<br/>because of the fame of the particular product.  *Cakewalk* really<br/>goes back a long way.  I remember it at MIDI conventions in New York<br/>in the 1980&apos;s when MIDI was still new to a lot of people.</p><p>So I guess the bottom line is:</p><p>_Samplitude_ or some such:  multi-track recording angle</p><p>SONAR:  sequencing angle (primarily)....</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>jp</p></div>
