That is pretty much OK by me.</p><p>On the other hand, one of the things about caring for a list is occasionally stoking the fires, throwing out questions, etc., to keep the brains activated and the fingers typing.</p><p>All leading to say that the last couple of months have been really difficult on the home front for yours truly, the kind of matters in life that require one to refocus just where they can and can&apos;t put their energies. And, in spite of my desires, online life has had to take a bit of a back seat.</p><p>So I go to bed, firm in the knowledge that people are still making microtonal music(s), even if they aren&apos;t typing about it. And we even have examples of it, the most bonus of them the recent activities of Alison Monteith.</p><p>So I&apos;ll be back, and I hope you are all creating, performing, and thinking about the musics that haven&apos;t happened yet...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;&apos;&grave;<br/>Real Life: Orchestral Percussionist<br/>Web Life: &quot;Corporeal Meadows&quot; - about Harry Partch<br/>                         <a href="http://www.corporeal.com/">http://www.corporeal.com/</a><br/>NOTE:<br/>If your reply bounces, try --&gt; jonszanto@...</p></div><h3><a id=3847 href="#3847">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2002 4:58:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.

I haven&apos;t really been around either, but my<br/>troubles are mainly with my computer and with having too much<br/>work.</p><p>But this coming weekend I should mention I will be outside San<br/>Diego, in Poway California where the San Diego Harpsichord<br/>Society is having a clavichord exposition Saturday and Sunday, with<br/>maybe 10 instruments on display for people to try from 11 to 2 and<br/>me giving an informal concert on one of them at 2:00 each day. I&apos;ll<br/>be playing on a copy of a late Portuguese instrument in 6th comma<br/>meantone, I know at least one of the instruments on display will be<br/>in classic quarter-comma meantone, and the others will mainly be in<br/>one non-equal circulating temperament or another, at least if I am<br/>who is doing the tuning. The concerts seat a maximum of 20 and I<br/>think they are theoretically sold out, &apos;especially Saturday&apos;, I am told,<br/>but chances are I could squeeze a serious microtonalist in. &quot;There&apos;s<br/>always room for one more at a round table!&quot;, I proved by<br/>mathematical induction in some silly high school new math course.<br/>Remember New Math?</p><p>Judy</p><p>-</p></div><h3><a id=3850 href="#3850">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/22/2002 3:58:24 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Judy,</p><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., judithconrad@m... wrote:<br/>&gt; Sorry about the troubles.</p><p>Thanks, and thanks to Gene and Joe for their thoughts as well.</p><p>&gt; But this coming weekend I should mention I will be outside San<br/>&gt; Diego, in Poway California</p><p>Oh, how excellent and distressing! I am concertizing and don&apos;t think I can make it, but you should post this to the main tuning list as well in case some of the San Diego tune-lings aren&apos;t on this list.
