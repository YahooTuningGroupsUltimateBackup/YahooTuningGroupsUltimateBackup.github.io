Zalzal, a musician playing the oud<br/>(of which one variation is the European lute) in 8th-century Baghdad,<br/>is credited with introducing a neutral third fret or _wusta_, a note<br/>for which al-Farabi gives a ratio of 27/22, and for which other<br/>theorists suggest other shades of intonation. In al-Farabi&apos;s version,<br/>the just ratios are:</p><p>    1/1     9/8   27/22   4/3     3/2   18/11   16/9      2/1<br/>     0      204    355    498     702    853     996     1200</p><p>In a 17-tone version, which might be realized in an equal temperament<br/>(as in the Seventeen-Tone Piano Project) or an unequal temperament<br/>(for example, George Secor&apos;s 17-tone well-temperament or 17-WT), the<br/>basic pattern and spelling is like this using my Sagittal notation for<br/>the score, or alternatively conventional sharps and flats:</p><p>     G     A  B\|/  C     D  E\|/  F    G<br/>     G     A   A#   C     D   D#   F    G<br/>     0     3    5   7    10   12  14    17<br/>        3     2   2    3    2   2    3<br/>     |--------------|--------------|<br/>            Rast           Rast</p><p>Zalzal&apos;s scale as realized in a 17-note thirdtone tuning consists of<br/>two conjunct tetrachords of the Rast variety (3-2-2, tone plus two<br/>neutral seconds) plus an upper tone to complete the octave.

In some sections actually having one hand on each of the<br/>two 12-note keyboards might be a possible strategy for handling<br/>unisons or crossing voices, since both keyboards support the seven<br/>naturals. For the conclusion (measures 23-31), for example, one could<br/>play the two lower voices on the piano with five flats (actually using<br/>only naturals on this keyboard), and the highest voice on the piano<br/>with sharps to obtain D# (E\|/) and A# (B\|/).</p><p>In the mp3 version, the tuning is unequal:</p><p>     G     A   B\|/  C    D  E\|/  F     G<br/>     0    208   358 496  704  854 992  1200</p><p>My warmest thanks to Jacob for the Seventeen-Tone Piano Project, and<br/>also to Shaahin and Yahya for their encouragement in using the scales<br/>of the Maqam and Dastgah systems for polyphony.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=14548 href="#14548">ðŸ”—</a>c.m.bryan &#x3C;chrismbryan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/23/2006 5:34:44 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo:</p><p>As usual, thanks so much.

In a Near Eastern style, we have available various<br/>shades and colors of neutral intervals also -- a much richer and<br/>more subtle spectrum!</p><p>This is maybe most simply apparent in a style of improvisation<br/>with a single melody, possibly accompanied by a drone: the<br/>neutral steps have their own character, and one which, as the<br/>performer and scholar Ali Jihad Racy has written, can communicate<br/>&quot;ecstasy.&quot;</p><p>In composed polyphony, I find sometimes that I have a tendency to<br/>hear certain progressions in three or four voices as &quot;somewhat<br/>like&quot; a familiar European progression -- although also different.<br/>Thus I might say, &quot;This sounds a bit like the lower voice is<br/>descending by a tone and the upper voices rising by semitones&quot;<br/>when in fact all three voices are moving by neutral seconds. I<br/>have a tendency with this kind of polyphony to want to hear a<br/>familiar pattern -- and yet relish the different musical color<br/>which tells me that this is a different world of sonority.</p><p>Between improvisation mostly focused on a single melody and<br/>written polyphony taking a European form as a starting point,<br/>there is the possibility of a polyphonic _taqsim_ or dastgah<br/>style of improvisation. Can one freely and fluidly improvise two<br/>or more melodies at once, letting the traditional patterns of<br/>_sayr_ or _gusheh_ influence the musical process as much as the<br/>vertical relationships between the voices? That is the creative<br/>question.</p><p>A vital point which you are demonstrating in your music is that<br/>polyphony does not require compromising the intonational variety<br/>of the different maqamat or dastgah-ha. However, that variety<br/>might lead polyphony in new directions which we must seek out.</p><p>By the way, may I warmly thank George Secor, who pointed me in<br/>the direction of Zalzal&apos;s scale and explored with me from his<br/>perspective some of the things I have described about<br/>progressions for three and four voices in Middle Eastern<br/>tunings.</p><p>Peace and love, with many thanks,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=14571 href="#14571">ðŸ”—</a>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2006 7:42:04 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Posted by: &quot;Carl Lumma&quot; ekin@... clumma</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s amazing how medieval this sounds (and I mean that in the best<br/>&gt; possible way!).

In a JI<br/>version of the Zalzal tuning, this would be a pure 2:3:4. In either<br/>the unequal temperament of this mp3 or 17-EDO, the fifth is slightly<br/>wide and the fourth likewise narrow. Either this complete three-voice<br/>consonance, or the simple interval of the fifth, serves as a<br/>satisfying point of repose and contrasts with more active intervals.</p><p>At measure 15, such a contrast occurs when the highest voice descends<br/>by a neutral second of E\|/6-D6, producing a sonority of E\|/5-B\|/5-D6<br/>with a fifth and neutral seventh above the lowest part and an upper<br/>neutral third, in the mp3 around 0-704-1050 cents and very close to<br/>the JI ratios of 6:9:11. This sonority, somewhat tense and yet having<br/>a degree of concord, is repeated at the start of measure 16 and then<br/>resolves to the stable fifth F5-C6, with the outer neutral seventh<br/>contracting to a fifth and the upper neutral third to a unison.</p><p>At the opening of measure 17, we move to a mildly unstable sonority,<br/>G5-C6-D6, with a fourth and a fifth above the lowest voice and a major<br/>second between the upper voices, close to the just 6:8:9 which would<br/>obtain in the original Zalzal/al-Farabi JI tuning. This sonority has a<br/>pleasing quality rather like that of a fifth-octave consonance or<br/>simple fifth, but with the relatively tense major second adding an<br/>active and unstable quality. Here, in a typical cadential figure, this<br/>element of motion or activity leads to another unstable sonority: the<br/>upper voices expand from a major second to a fourth, forming a<br/>sonority of G5-B\|/5-E\|/6 with neutral third and sixth above the<br/>lowest voice, here about 0-358-854 cents.</p><p>The passage concludes at measure 18 as the neutral third expands to a<br/>fifth and the neutral sixth to an octave, arriving at F5-C6-F6, a<br/>full and stable concord.</p><p>Also, it might not hurt to point out that while the characteristic<br/>progressions in this portion of the composition often alternate stable<br/>and unstable sonorities, the cadences are to stable sonorities built<br/>on steps other than the final or concluding note, G. Here is the scale<br/>in rounded cents in Sagittal, Persian, and 17-EDO notations (with<br/>rounded 17-EDO cents at the bottom):</p><p>Sagittal:      G     A    B\|/   C      D     E\|/   F       G<br/>Persian:       G     A     Bp    C      D     Ep     F       G<br/>mp3 cents:     0    208   358   496    704    854   992     1200<br/>----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>17-EDO         G     A     A#    C      D     D#     F       G<br/>cents:         0    212   353   494    706    847   988     1200</p><p>&gt; I may make the experiment of tuning up and playing your piece, with<br/>&gt; variations, just for the learning experience!

Of course, I&apos;d be glad to help with any<br/>unresolved or new difficulties, or explore the question of what would<br/>happen if the middle voice were shifted by a scale step at measures<br/>14-18 (a good exercise for understanding the tuning system and style).</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=14573 href="#14573">ðŸ”—</a>Hudson Lacerda &#x3C;hfmlacerda@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/25/2006 8:00:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo Schulter escreveu:</p><p>&gt; By the way, speaking of the 17-TPP, people might want to take a look<br/>&gt; at Ozan&apos;s Web site:<br/>&gt; &gt;            &lt;<a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/">http://www.ozanyarman.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Alternative text for the images in that web page would be very fine...<br/>Cheers,</p><p>--<br/>  &apos;-------------------------------------------------------------------.<br/>Hudson Lacerda &lt;<a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com.br/hfmlacerda/">http://geocities.yahoo.com.br/hfmlacerda/</a>&gt;<br/>*N&iuml;&iquest;&half;o deixe seu voto sumir! <a href="http://www.votoseguro.org/">http://www.votoseguro.org/</a><br/>*Ap&iuml;&iquest;&half;ie o Manifesto:        <a href="http://www.votoseguro.com/alertaprofessores/">http://www.votoseguro.com/alertaprofessores/</a></p><p>                    == THE WAR IN IRAQ COSTS ==<br/><a href="http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=182">http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=182</a><br/>  .-------------------------------------------------------------------&apos;<br/>--</p><p>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________ Yahoo!

The intonation here goes a bit further than I can<br/>&gt;&gt; say I&apos;ve ever heard in an early music performance, but it still<br/>&gt;&gt; functions in the same space.  It&apos;s just lovely to hear.  I&apos;m sure<br/>&gt;&gt; Ozan Yarman would appreciate the polyphonic use of this scale, also<br/>&gt;&gt; (I think he may only be on the tuning list -- have you considered<br/>&gt;&gt; cross-posting?).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Dear Carl,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Thank you for nicely capturing about as well as it can be done in<br/>&gt;words my intentions for this piece in terms of something that<br/>&gt;&quot;functions in the same space&quot; as 13th-century European polyphony, and<br/>&gt;yet has a certain Middle Eastern quality also.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;In response to your suggestion about Ozan Yarman, I&apos;ve sent him an<br/>&gt;e-mail forwarding my original post; but this isn&apos;t to rule out my<br/>&gt;posting to the tuning list also.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Since we&apos;re discussing this, please let me give me permission for<br/>&gt;anyone active on the tuning list or other tuning-related groups to<br/>&gt;forward my posts here to those groups whenever they seem topical and<br/>&gt;helpful for a given forum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;By the way, speaking of the 17-TPP, people might want to take a look<br/>&gt;at Ozan&apos;s Web site:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;           &lt;<a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com/">http://www.ozanyarman.com/</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;which has what looks like a comprehensive setting of drawings for some<br/>&gt;kind of 17-tone piano, one keyboard with flats and the other with<br/>&gt;sharps (I regret my ignorance of Turkish, but the musical symbols and<br/>&gt;numbers may give a general idea).</p><p>Which paper is that?
