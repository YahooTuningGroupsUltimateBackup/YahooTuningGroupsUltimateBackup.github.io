One path maintains the 12tet value for each midi pitch number and then retunes, note-by-note, via pitch bends, the other path ignores the 12tet values of each midi pitch number and instead maps each tone of the desired tuning to a midi-pitch number (with the precise tuning of that pitch number done through either an additional tuning specification table or a full-keyboard tuning of the synth or a rendering program or a relay program like InTun).  Could Maple -- or a similar package -- be used to make a stand-alone program that would  simply locate each occurance of a given pitch number + pitch bend instruction (as in the first path) and replace it with a pitch number (as in the second path), or vice versa?</p><p>Daniel Wolf</p></div>
