I&apos;d really<br/>&gt;like to follow your progress!</p><p>I can send you out a CD-R and I have a beta version of a DVD-Video ready as well that I am updating to include the live performance video/audio.  When I get a full length CD released I&apos;ll bundle this DVD as bonus. :: crossing fingers :: for a release on Asphodel by next summer or so..</p><p>I put up the first section of my live performance (this is what is going to be played back at the Dartmouth concert). It comes in around 22 megs:<br/><a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/live/06_06_03_Catharsis_Live@Felix_Kulpa_Gallery/06_06_03_Catharsis(Live@Felix_Kulpa_Gallery)_Section_I.mp3">http://catharsis.egregious.net/live/06_06_03_Catharsis_Live@Felix_Kulpa_Gallery/06_06_03_Catharsis(Live@Felix_Kulpa_Gallery)_Section_I.mp3</a></p><p>&gt; &gt;Scream is coming along... lots of cool stuff... some &quot;temporary&quot; ???<br/>&gt; &gt;disappointments (Java gripes; especially the Mac JDK! well... It just<br/>&gt; &gt;sucks; boo on Apple).<br/>&gt;It is just totally screwed when a big part of the &apos;platform independence&apos;<br/>&gt;equation goes flat.</p><p>Yeah. I was really bummed when I found out Sun has only 1 person (development, QA, and public contact) on the JavaSound API. Very few are using it as it is not fully implemented; they don&apos;t put more people on it because few are using it... vicious cycle.   Currently I am using it just for midi IO.  I have to do some more testing, but midi IO seemed a little weak on the Mac port.</p><p>In general what is more frustrating is that the graphics/Swing seem half as fast on the Mac port to a comparable PC. This isn&apos;t good! Plus Apple is dragging on implementing new versions/updates of the VM. I have yet to test Linux, but I believe it will be more solid there.</p><p>One last gotcha when working with Java is that getting proper timing is difficult.   The best way to do it (right now) is with threads and a while -&gt; thread yield loop. Without rambling on here this makes things difficult for running a lot of programs on the same computer.</p><p>Currently I am now looking at 3 computer setup for optimal usage of Scream (2 if you just want Scream and SC3, etc.)  One dedicated computer for Java/Scream (only has to be  ~1.2ghz machine; nothing too beefy), along with a beefy PC and Mac.  Ouch... yeah.. it is a headache to move all of this around, but I&apos;ll be pulling off some cool custom performance software with such a setup.</p><p>On another note though I was very excited to hear the recent announcement from Lynx Studio (<a href="http://www.lynxstudio.com">www.lynxstudio.com</a>) on their AES-16 interface.   My ultimate goal is to have 2 of those in the beefy PC and one in the beefy Mac; with the possibility of adding the LS-Adat card also to the PC.  Lynx Studio is now supporting OSX with CoreAudio drivers (needed for SC3).</p><p>RME will be releasing a low cost MADI interface latter in the year as well. This will be very attractive, however they will only have XP drivers and if/when they make Mac drivers they might or might not be CoreAudio based; though they should have them!.... Currently, I think they only offer ASIO based drivers in regard to their Hammerfall series for the Mac.</p><p>&gt;Do you know the spatialization program &quot;spat&quot;? It has been grown here in<br/>&gt;San Diego at the UCSD Center for Music and Technology by Peter Otto. It &gt;can do *amazing* things sonically, and apparently is getting around in usage.</p><p>Actually Naut Humon and Asphodel is a leading user of spatialization technology in the US. Sound Traffic Control is the name for Naut&apos;s spatial system. He has worked closely with Peter Otto and the STC is listed on the Spat web page.</p><p>A student of Otto&apos;s is also working with Naut/Asphodel on a Max based spatialization environment. I believe the current operation of the STC is solely based on this work. This environment basically works from preset midi trajectories; though I am sure it might be extended.</p><p>I&apos;m kind of a wild card in the mix. The work I am doing is totally from scratch with my Java environment and SuperCollider3. It is taking me a while to get things started as there is no prior work here, but development is rolling along nicely now.</p><p>I should have a lot of neat features complete for spatialization by Burning Man. Some of the things I&apos;ll have include:</p><p>Dynamic physics panning simulations:<br/>- NBody gravity<br/>- spring based<br/>both of the above with/without collisions<br/>- time varying vector field</p><p>All of that has been done before; well maybe not the time varying vector field; at least I haven&apos;t seen/read an implementation in regard to audio spatialization; I&apos;m sure it is out there somewhere though.</p><p>One of my large goals beyond physics related dynamics systems is to create a geometry based spatialization engine; where trajectories are based on user inputted formulas or wizard based. All of this with time varying data of course. Rock...</p><p>&gt;Boy, but it would be great to see an installation at BMan. Don&apos;t forget the<br/>&gt;sunblock (or mud)... :)</p><p>Things look very good in regard to this. It looks like I might be coordinating spatialization for the JK system.  The system is going to be a massive 8 channel array; each channel will be a 6&apos;X12&apos; stack of speakers.  Woa! Can&apos;t wait to perform on it... People are going to trip out; uh, well trip out double.  Great thing is that when people are not performing on it I&apos;ll have generative audio (and spatialization) running on the system.</p><p>&gt; &gt;One of my tracks is very quirky and microtonal based. Neato...<br/>&gt; &gt;Production/engineering is stunning if I may say so myself... ;)<br/>&gt;And so you did! Damn, post some chunks at least!</p><p>Hah hah.. no chunks.. no chunks... I do have the mp3s here:<br/><a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/xenos_ep">http://catharsis.egregious.net/tracks/xenos_ep</a></p><p>catharsis_xenos_2003.mp3 is the only one with explicit micro content. 8 megs, so you should be able to grab it! :)</p><p>It is hard techno though, so if you don&apos;t like that stuff no complaining! ;P</p><p>&gt;Another of the great losses. I tried to keep the vibes cool on MMM, but &gt;was  unsuccessful. He&apos;s OK, though...</p><p>Doh.. I always enjoyed Mr. Ligon&apos;s input..</p><p>Someone said:<br/>&gt;If you can&apos;t afford better speakers, get headphones.</p><p>I definitely vouch for this approach and recommend the best: Sennheiser HD-600. I had to listen to a lot of music for a second time after getting my pair.. I didn&apos;t have good speakers; still don&apos;t have a great studio setup.</p><p>Hope all is well,<br/>--Mike</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div>
