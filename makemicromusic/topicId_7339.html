This was on purpose, so as to implement a sort<br/>of quasi-organic &apos;flamming&apos; feeling, like one naturally gets in the<br/>microdifferences in ensemble playing, or in finger differences at a keyboard,<br/>etc.</p><p>2) *skewing* early or late randomly would tend to make it feel like it was<br/>rushing or dragging over the long haul, which I didn&apos;t want. And besides, I<br/>think those things should convey what is going on musically, for instance<br/>delaying slightly a dissonance to a consonance in an appogiatura. So in<br/>answer to your questions about what musicians do, which I know first hand<br/>being a frequent performer and colleague of some great performers, these<br/>draggings (which are probably more common, I suspect, because of rubato) or<br/>rushings happen in response to affective or structural considerations in the<br/>music, at least when the performer is a master, and deliberately doing it.<br/>But, short of writing an advanced context sensitive artificial intelligence<br/>program, or hand entering such values myself, I do believe the Gaussian<br/>distribution curve breathing life into the file is the next best &apos;automatic&apos;,<br/>albeit slightly imperfect, solution. But I have no pretense that it is<br/>solving an *interpretive* problem, only a sonic one, and I think it succeeds<br/>admirably at making the surface of the music more interesting in its<br/>imperfection!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Aaron Krister Johnson<br/><a href="http://www.dividebypi.com">http://www.dividebypi.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.akjmusic.com">http://www.akjmusic.com</a></p></div><h3>Prent Rodgers &#x3C;prentrodgers@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/2004 8:43:24 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Aaron,<br/>This realization is great. I&apos;ve listened to it a few times and get a<br/>kick out of some of the harmonies. There is something really wierd at<br/>the 48 second mark, with a modulation that I don&apos;t think the composer<br/>considered. But I like it. The temporal adjustments at 1:55 are great.<br/>It really sounds like someone playing the harpsichord, with the gentle<br/>almost arpegiated chords.</p><p>The next step is to take the aspect you said couldn&apos;t be done and do<br/>it. That is, &quot;for instance delaying slightly a dissonance to a<br/>consonance in an appogiatura&quot;.

Update !!!</p><p>I have completed my John Bull &apos;Ut Re Mi Fa Sol La&apos; realization a couple of<br/>days ago....and am just now posting it. It&apos;s nice to be done with a project<br/>that I&apos;ve been delaying for months!</p><p>I left information from my original post a while back (when it was *almost*<br/>done) below for reference.</p><p>Here it is (complete version as a .ogg file):<br/>&#x9;<a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/bull_ut_re.ogg">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/bull_ut_re.ogg</a></p><p>As an incomplete mp3 file:<br/>&#x9;<a href="http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/bull_ut_re.mp3">http://www.akjmusic.com/audio/bull_ut_re.mp3</a></p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>Yes, I&apos;m posting it complete only as an .ogg file. This is not to alienate<br/>listeners, lose audience, etc, but because I believe in maximal fidelity in<br/>sound for a compressed format, and I don&apos;t believe in sacrificing that to the<br/>degree that I can help it. It is clearer to me than ever after doing<br/>extensive comparisons and research over the last couple of days that .ogg<br/>files are superior to .mp3s, in spite of the arguments for the ubiquitousness<br/>of .mp3. Nevertheless, I give a sample of the last minute and a half or so of<br/>the realization as an mp3; hopefully, if any of you stalwart mp3 users are<br/>intrigued enough, you will join the revolution, and update your listening<br/>situation to include .ogg capability.</p><p>For those of you who missed the ogg/mp3 debate, I had a relevant post about<br/>directly comparing their implementation, at least at it occurs on the linux<br/>platform. I included a &apos;snippet.wav&apos; example, compressed to both mp3 and ogg,<br/>and the results speak for themselves.

And I&apos;d encourage everyone to check out ogg stuff. If I had the time I&apos;d post links to the encoder I&apos;ve used, but orch season starts again in about 36 hours and I got a lot of gear to get together...</p><p>BTW: is the diff between your ogg file and the wav file greater or lesser than the diff between the ogg and the mp3? (in fidelity, that is)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
