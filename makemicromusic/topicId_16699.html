Two of the pieces to be performed in the NYC<br/>area are microtonal, in the 21-note subset of 72-equal, called<br/>the &quot;Blackjack&quot; scale which was invented on these lists.  The other<br/>bass flute piece might as well be microtonal, the way the flute<br/>player is playing it.  I&apos;m enjoying his rendition, however.  Here is<br/>the post:</p><p>Concert notices</p><p>For those of you with the time and interest, there are three local<br/>NYC performances by Joseph Pehrson coming up.  Two of them have free<br/>admission, and one a $10 charge.</p><p>On Saturday, April 28, the NYU Steinhardt School of Education is<br/>honoring the retirement of composition director, Dinu Ghezzo on a<br/>concert at NYU Loewe Theatre, 35 W. 4th Street, NYC.  (between Greene<br/>Street and Washington Square East). The concert begins at 5PM.<br/>(PLEASE NOTE TIME).  Admission is free.   I am pleased to have a<br/>piece on this concert, my new &quot;Microproj,&quot; an electronic work in the<br/>near-just-intonation 21-note scale of &quot;Blackjack,&quot; which I have been<br/>working with for several years now.  My wife, Linda Past, will be<br/>doing one of her &quot;dramatic-dance&quot; interpretations of this piece on<br/>the concert as well.  In addition to several pieces by Dinu Ghezzo,<br/>many using multimedia, John Gilbert has arranged an &quot;internet<br/>multimedia&quot; presentation, so there should be lots of variety there.</p><p>Monday evening, April 30, the Dinu Ghezzo honoring festivities<br/>continue with a concert at the Romanian Cultural Center, 200 East<br/>38th Street (corner of 3rd Ave) honoring Ghezzo&apos;s 38 years of<br/>composing in the US.  I am also happy to be included on this event<br/>with a performance of my &quot;Profondo&quot; for bass flute by Gerardo Levy.<br/>This concert begins at 7PM (AGAIN PLEASE NOTE TIME).  It is also free<br/>of charge.  Other composers on the concert include Leo Kraft, Robert<br/>Rowe,  Wendy Luck, and several others.</p><p>On Wednesday, May 2, the American Festival of Microtonal Music and<br/>Johnny Reinhard will host a performance of my &quot;Blackjinn,&quot; a work for<br/>woodwind quintet in the near-just-intonation 21-note &quot;Blackjack&quot;<br/>scale.  The concert is at the Bowery Poetry Club, located at 308<br/>Bowery at Bleecker Street (6 train to Bleecker).  The club concert<br/>begins at 10PM (YET AGAIN, PLEASE NOTE TIME).  Other composers on the<br/>program include Elodie Lauten, Kyle Gann and Johnny Reinhard.  Bass<br/>trombonist Dave Taylor will also be featured.  Tickets are $10 and,<br/>as in most club concerts, food and beverages are available.
