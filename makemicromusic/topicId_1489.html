It used to be that Midi did not have the capability od<br/>producing the toanl quality that i wanted, but now with new pysical<br/>modeling programs the quality has improved immensely. This has<br/>sparked interest in microtonal midi composing for me, but I realy<br/>don&apos;t know at all what I am doing. I have done enough reseach and<br/>fooling around so that I am able to ask a few questions.</p><p>How is it posible to use scala to tune cakewalk so that I can use the<br/>staff to write the music?</p><p>Are there any other good microtonal programs out there? I seems to me<br/>that scala is the most powerful if i could figure out how to utilize<br/>it.</p><p>What ways can I use phyiscal modeling synths such as Tassman to<br/>incorporate microtonal scales?</p><p>Any Help answering these questions would be greatly appreciated!</p><p>Blackbirdskies@...</p></div>
