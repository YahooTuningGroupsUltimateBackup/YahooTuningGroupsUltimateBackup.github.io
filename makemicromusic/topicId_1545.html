Jed Distler did in London.</p><p><a href="http://www.andante.com/magazine/article.cfm?id=12725">http://www.andante.com/magazine/article.cfm?id=12725</a></p><p>Thanks to Dan Stearns for posting that...</p><p>Very cool.  Nice going, Jed.</p><p>Jed is a neat guy and really &quot;wacko&quot; composer.  Talk about an anti-<br/>academic!
