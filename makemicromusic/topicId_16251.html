I *ABSOLUTELY*        hate a page that transparently forces music to be played, but a properly embedded player, with full controls accessible, is a very sensible approach to presenting music. I allows one to sample bits before downloading an entire piece, it allows the artist (if you will) to offer up music while still retaining a small bit of control, and when done efficiently and elegantly, can add value to the experience of visiting a musical site.</p><p>Try to differentiate between your experience (i.e. whether it works on your particular choice of hardware and software, and whether or not the music stream was done in a considerate and expert manner or just dumped on you) and what the technology can really do. When done properly, this is a technology that is very good for musicians to disseminate their work.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=16268 href="#16268">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/4/2007 1:56:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&gt; &gt;Eh???
