Maybe a trackball would be better there?</p><p>My word - how much noise could your mouse be making? Unless you are talking about the clicking of the buttons, which you&apos;ll still get with a trackball/trackpad, what is making noise? I&apos;ve got a cordless, ball-less mouse (I took it to the spay and neuter clinic) and it glides noiselessly on the surface of my desk.</p><p>Maybe what you actually have is a squirrel... :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=5592 href="#5592">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2003 1:09:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jon,</p><p>Yes, mine also is optical, though with a chord. Movement is noiseless. The scroll wheel movement is a low rumble and very<br/>quiet. But the clicks are very very loud indeed in a quiet room. So much so I think it must be deliberately done so that you<br/>can hear whether you have clicked or not indeed.</p><p>I&apos;ve tried out a touchpad before (and had forgotten about it) - you have no click at all, just<br/>a fairly quiet tap of your finger on the pad. So it might be the best solution for a quiet one.</p><p>Now I&apos;m trying to find a company to sell the keyboards of this type in the U.K. Plenty of them to sell<br/>in U.S. such as this one that I thought looked quite good (touchpad and quiet tactile keys).</p><p><a href="http://www.adesso.com/products_detail.asp?productid=60">http://www.adesso.com/products_detail.asp?productid=60</a></p><p>But I can&apos;t find any u.k. company that sells it yet, or even one that can send it from the US<br/>so still searching... Maybe I&apos;ll find one in the shops in town when they open on Monday<br/>(need to get it within a few days - missing a control key is rather awkward if one uses<br/>frequent keyboard shortcuts!).</p><p>Also not sure if it has a scroll wheel come to think of it. Those are pretty handy<br/>to have and I even sometimes use it as a modulation wheel with the p.c. keyboard in FTS<br/>:-).</p><p>Thanks,</p></div>
