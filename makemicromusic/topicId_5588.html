A little pricey, but should be the<br/>&gt; ultimate HID...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.fingerworks.com/">http://www.fingerworks.com/</a></p><p>Thanks, it does look interesting. Yes a bit more than<br/>I&apos;m expecting to pay indeed.</p><p>It looks as if it may be of interest for<br/>the option in FTS to play music from the p.c. keyboard.<br/>I wonder if it is able to play chords and triads...<br/>(most keyboards miss out notes in some triads)<br/>As far as I can see from the information, it looks<br/>as if it should be possible to program it to do so<br/>once they release the SDK if it can&apos;t do so yet.</p><p>Have you tried it out by any chance?</p><p>Though, it has a few drawbacks for typing for a touch typist.<br/>I just found this forum where various programmers and others<br/>discuss the very keyboard:</p><p><a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/01/07/10/0220214.shtml">http://slashdot.org/articles/01/07/10/0220214.shtml</a></p><p>Reading through those, a thing that springs to mind<br/>is that when I type I almost never look at the keyboard,<br/>except for some special characters, then out of the corner<br/>of my eye. Normally I type looking at the screen as I type, and<br/>touch type. So it is important to be able to feel where<br/>the keys are, otherwise how do you know if your<br/>hand drifts in position until you start to see wrong<br/>keys appear on the screen? Maybe the small area<br/>might also be a bit awkward for a touch typist.</p><p>But it has got me onto the lines of what to look for.</p><p>For now probably I&apos;ll get a silent tactile keyboard<br/>with a touchpad for the mouse, as I found a few of those using a search<br/>for &quot;quiet touchpad p.c. keyboard&quot;. I&apos;ve tried out touchpads<br/>before for mouse movement, sand they work well.</p><p>I&apos;ll be interested also to explore this one at<br/>some point for chord playing on the p.c.<br/>as it seems it has a lot of potential as a musical<br/>input device for a computer. It seems that they<br/>will release an SDK later too. I wonder if you<br/>will then be able to program it to do things<br/>like e.g. do pitch bend glides by simply<br/>moving your finger around after you press the<br/>note, maybe pitch bend different notes<br/>independently at once in that way too.<br/>So maybe I&apos;ll come back to it once they<br/>release the SDK and find out what can be done.</p><p>Thanks for an interesting link.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=5590 href="#5590">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2003 11:24:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;It looks as if it may be of interest for<br/>&gt;the option in FTS to play music from the p.c. keyboard.<br/>&gt;I wonder if it is able to play chords and triads...<br/>&gt;(most keyboards miss out notes in some triads)<br/>&gt;As far as I can see from the information, it looks<br/>&gt;as if it should be possible to program it to do so<br/>&gt;once they release the SDK if it can&apos;t do so yet.</p><p>It&apos;s my guess it can do arbitrary chords.
