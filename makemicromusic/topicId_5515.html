This is pretty OT, but I&apos;ll just share that I picked some windows up at a second hand store to use for picture frame glass. It all depends on how well the windows were made - these were constructed well, and it was hard to get the glass out without breaking. You might also try scoring just inside the perimeter of the window, tapping, and see if you can get out the majority of the window (i.e. *not* breaking up the frame).</p><p>&gt;And any ideas on<br/>&gt;a) rope-ladder &apos;frame&apos; (and somehow cushioning the individual bars)<br/>&gt;for playing bars vertically, perhaps versus<br/>&gt;b) horizontal, probably wooden frame?</p><p>Terribly bad idea. Much harder to be accurate, and much harder to gauge force of blows (you&apos;re talking to a professional percussionist, remember...). Lay them horizontally (like a marimba) and it will be far more sensible. Besides, that&apos;s the only good way to add resonators.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
