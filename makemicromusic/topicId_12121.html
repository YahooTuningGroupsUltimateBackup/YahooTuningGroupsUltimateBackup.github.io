I&apos;d like to say a thing or two about this if I may. First, and I&apos;m afraid this may get overlooked from time to time, the TUNING doesn&apos;t matter one bit; the MUSIC does. I never heard Bartok apologize for using 12 eq, and he did ok with it, as did many thousands of other composers over the last 250 years. What I tell all my students (and anybody else) is this: when you write a piece, make me FEEL something, make me weep, laugh, get angry, or whatever, but MOVE me, and that&apos;s all I ask.<br/>   Being a great composer is an entirely different skill from talking about tuning theory, and I hate to say it, not trying to start a ruckus here, but I have heard much non 12 music over the last 17 years, and very little of it was/is very good, by my standards of composition. That being said, I am always delighted to hear what folks are up to as composers, and I would always encourage folks to write and perform as much as possible, because we need to actually hear real music in other systems, not just chat about it...or so I believe.<br/>  But, just as a large vocabulary doesn&apos;t mean one can write a great book, advanced tuning knowledge doesn&apos;t mean you can write a good piece. I personally believe that a great (or even really good) composition is a rare breed, especially today. I reacall Wayne Shorter saying in an interview a few years back that &quot;nobody is composing their asses off anymore,&quot; and I agree. So, CM, gogogo, use whatever tuning you want, but make your piece deep and profound, and I personally could care less where the decimal places are between intervals, or if the notes beat, or if the ratios are high or low. And neither will most other people...best...HHH<br/><a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a></p></div><h3>daniel_anthony_stearns &#x3C;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/31/2006 11:40:17 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>thanks Neil .I&apos;m with you 100% on this .Btw, I wish you&apos;d stop over<br/>to the kronoforum and contribute there,I think you&apos;d fit right<br/>in.hope things are going well for you .</p><p>daniel</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Neil Haverstick&quot;<br/>&lt;microstick@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Hey CM Bryan...glad to see you have some new pieces happening,<br/>but it was<br/>&gt; interesting that you were somewhat concerned about potential<br/>criticism of 19<br/>&gt; eq, and were sort of apologizing in advance, before anyone could<br/>nail you<br/>&gt; for your choice.

So do please<br/>remind ME whenever I cross that line, as I may<br/>have done recently.  In future I&apos;ll try to post such<br/>stuff to the tuning or tuning-math lists, and post<br/>at most a brief link here.</p><p>The most exciting thing I find on this forum is the<br/>new and different music you guys are making.<br/>Thank you SO much for this.

There is a lot of contemporany compositions using 24ET, just because it is, from a point-of-view, a logic extension of 12ET. 24ET is very good for music related to the post-tonal/atonal/serial thread. Its familiarity is mainly related to maintaining the known 12 chromatic pitches and their notation. For performers, this is an important reference for tuning.

If A is 438.66 Hz then D<br/>would be in tune with a 12-EDO D with A=440, right? That seems like it<br/>*does* minimize the errors relative to C major already, because D is<br/>the center of the C major scale (F-C-G-D-A-E-B).</p><p>I think it&apos;s futile to minimize the differences from chromatic 12-edo,<br/>because if some notes on one side of the circle of fifths are in tune,<br/>the ones on the opposite side will be the farthest apart from each<br/>other. Making the Ds in tune seems like a good idea to me.</p><p>&gt; Best,<br/>&gt; Hudson</p><p>Keenan</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/17/2006 4:39:03 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Keenan,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;Ah, I wasn&apos;t thinking of atonal or serial music because they&apos;re just not my cup of tea.

I think that weird guy<br/>&gt; Bill Flavell was suggesting something like this...</p><p>I don&apos;t think so. There is no an opposition consonance/dissonance in atonal music, but several levels of affinity between tones instead, from the &grave;&grave;soft&apos;&apos; traditional &grave;&grave;consonances&apos;&apos; til &grave;&grave;hard&apos;&apos; complex relations (&grave;&grave;dissonances&apos;&apos;).</p><p>Atonal music -- in the sense in which Schoenberg&apos;s music can be called atonal -- is just a sort of extreme chromatic tonal music, but not &grave;&grave;mistuned&apos;&apos; music or simply &grave;&grave;dissonant&apos;&apos; music (as &grave;&grave;bad approximations to JI could suggest&apos;&apos;). Schoenberg prefered the word &grave;&grave;pantonal&apos;&apos; (all tones, or all keys) to describe his music.</p><p>BTW, I find it is a good idea integrate material elements from the tradition rather than exclude them. 19ET, 24ET, 31ET and other scales can do microtonal modal, tonal *and* atonal music (not 12-tone, obviously, but sounding atonal still).</p><p>[...]<br/>&gt;&gt;In my opinion (for _my own_ use), the only multiple of 12 to go is 24,<br/>&gt;&gt;and perhaps, in some circunstances, 48!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What&apos;s wrong with 72? Or 36, which has good 8/7s and 7/6s at least.</p><p>Yes, but for instrumental music, a high number of divisions is problematic, and the notation itself imposes other questions: the near pure intervals vs. the usual tempered ones can causes confusion (because the needed tuning adjusts in complex chords).</p><p>I misses 36ET which can be interesting really, but I am not sure that some intervals can be understood as such, given the tuning errors from JI (I need try it).</p><p>72ET is too divided to me for general use (harmonic mainly) -- its pitch classes are not clearly discrete for the perception -- one perceives mainly different &grave;&grave;flavors&apos;&apos; of an interval, instead of really independent intervals classes.</p><p>Anyway, this is a personal opinion. I prefer let to the performers a considerable margin for expressive intonation (adjusting the tuning by ear and accoding to the feeling) rather than write the precise pitches in detail. 72ET is too difficult to tune by ear during a performance, except for simple textures using small melodic intervals. Harmony demands some flexibility, and this is an important reason to the existence of 12ET: it is an artificial tuning reference to be corrected by ear in the practice.</p><p>The choice of the scales depends on each specific compositional project. Whatever scale can be useful in some circunstance. I was talking about scales for a general use, which could be tied to western music tradition and instruments (tonal, modal, atonal, serial music).</p><p>&gt;&gt;Another interesting thing is that even the &grave;&grave;complexity&apos;&apos; composer Brian<br/>&gt;&gt;Ferneyghough, when writting for string quartet, have limited himself to<br/>&gt;&gt;24ET plus intonation deviations, resulting in an _imprecise_ 48ET.

The premise is that one already knows how to play in<br/>     24 ( in some form, let&apos;s say 24 EDO to keep things simple)<br/>     and one wants to extend the melodic resourses here. Why?<br/>     Why not just learn to play in 19 EDO or 31 EDO etc. Because<br/>     of the time it takes to learn a new EDO *with* virtuosity.<br/>     This includes the ability to improvise on the spot of course.<br/>     Because of the time it takes to get a real feel deep down<br/>     of the scale. Then there is the subject of notation. At least<br/>     all three 24&apos;s could be notated the same way. A asterisk<br/>     at the bottom of the page of music would indicate which version<br/>     of 24 is in use for the piece.</p><p>     I&apos;m not saying 3 versions of 24 is the best. I&apos;m not saying<br/>     this is some fantastic idea.

There is a lot of<br/>&gt; contemporany compositions using 24ET, just because it is, from a<br/>&gt; point-of-view, a logic extension of 12ET. 24ET is very good for<br/>music<br/>&gt; related to the post-tonal/atonal/serial thread. Its familiarity is<br/>&gt; mainly related to maintaining the known 12 chromatic pitches and<br/>their<br/>&gt; notation. For performers, this is an important reference for<br/>tuning.<br/>&gt; Just think of a clarinet player, who needs to learn new<br/>quartertone<br/>&gt; fingerings, but still uses the common chromatic ones, so that the<br/>global<br/>&gt; tuning is assured by the performer&apos;s familiarity with 50% the<br/>pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the other hand, &grave;&grave;meantone&apos;&apos; tunings like 19ET (or 31ET) can<br/>&gt; integrate all pitches and intervals as corresponding to the known<br/>&gt; diatonic/altered intervals/functions (rather than separate fields,<br/>like<br/>&gt; 24ET == 12ET + displaced 12 ET). From a listener perspective, they<br/>seem<br/>&gt; easier to understand. But for performer, there are some difficults<br/>to<br/>&gt; domain (the small deviations from the &grave;&grave;standard&apos;&apos; pitches,<br/>demanding<br/>&gt; possibly new fingerings even for the already known pitches).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In my opinion (for _my own_ use), the only multiple of 12 to go is<br/>24,<br/>&gt; and perhaps, in some circunstances, 48!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Keenan Pepper &#x3C;keenanpepper@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/22/2006 6:40:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 2/22/06, stephenszpak &lt;<a href="mailto:stephen_szpak@hotmail.com">stephen_szpak@hotmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;    Keenan (or Hudson?) {{anyone can comment of course}}<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  I&apos;ve read that 72 EDO has everything that is worth anything<br/>&gt;  in it.

In the later case, just intonation can reduce the ambiguity of the interval, and therefore its harmonic possibilities.</p><p>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;-chris<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And there are just chords, in which every pair of pitches forms a<br/>&gt; consonant interval, which are not otonalities or utonalities. What is<br/>&gt; the fundamental of 3:5:9:15?</p><p>Maybe I should have said &grave;root&apos; instead of &grave;fundamental&apos; in the quoted message, but there is an important relation between these concepts in harmonic practice.</p><p>For sure there are ambiguous chords in JI, for example chains of a given interval (e.g. (6:5) -- (6:5)^2 -- (6:5)^3 -- (6:5)^4... ), or &grave;inverted&apos; fragments of harmonic series (e.g minor triad). But such chords tends yet to a certain meaning.</p><p>I think for 3:5:9:15, the root could be 3 (&grave;&grave;add6&apos;&apos;) or, in certain contexts, 5 (m7 -- 6/5 chord).</p><p>Then, I would say that just intonation *tends* to reduce the ambiguity of intervals towards to more precise harmonic meanings.</p><p>Better wording?</p><p>--<br/>  &apos;-------------------------------------------------------------------.<br/>Hudson Lacerda &lt;<a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com.br/hfmlacerda/">http://geocities.yahoo.com.br/hfmlacerda/</a>&gt;<br/>*N&atilde;o deixe seu voto sumir! <a href="http://www.votoseguro.org/">http://www.votoseguro.org/</a><br/>*Ap&oacute;ie o Manifesto:        <a href="http://www.votoseguro.com/alertaprofessores/">http://www.votoseguro.com/alertaprofessores/</a></p><p>                    == THE WAR IN IRAQ COSTS ==<br/><a href="http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=182">http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=182</a><br/>  .-------------------------------------------------------------------&apos;<br/>--</p><p>&#x9;</p><p>&#x9;<br/>&#x9;&#x9;<br/>_______________________________________________________ Yahoo! doce lar.

Also, if you play simultaneously two<br/>&gt; &gt; neighbour pitches (e.g. [0,1]), the listener will perceive a<br/>(beating)<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch that is not in the scale (the mean frequency).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There&apos;s a fallacy that &quot;if you want to play the note<br/>&gt; between Bb and B, just play both together&quot;.  Many<br/>&gt; jazz players allegedly do so to get a more &quot;natural&quot;<br/>&gt; seventh harmonic.  But there are some factors that<br/>&gt; make this approach unlikely to achieve the desired<br/>&gt; result:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.  Only advanced players can vary the dynamics<br/>&gt; adequately in music played at speed so as the &quot;mixed&quot;<br/>&gt; note is not overly prominent in the mix.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2.  The perceived average frequency note is not<br/>&gt; really the seventh harmonic.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3.

It&apos;s the same pattern of intervals. If a piano<br/>were<br/>&gt; tuned to 12-edo, but 25 cents flat of A=440, would it be a new<br/>system<br/>&gt; of music? No, it would still be 12-edo.

Also, if you play simultaneously two<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; neighbour pitches (e.g. [0,1]), the listener will perceive a<br/>&gt; (beating)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; pitch that is not in the scale (the mean frequency).<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; There&apos;s a fallacy that &quot;if you want to play the note<br/>&gt; &gt; between Bb and B, just play both together&quot;.  Many<br/>&gt; &gt; jazz players allegedly do so to get a more &quot;natural&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; seventh harmonic.  But there are some factors that<br/>&gt; &gt; make this approach unlikely to achieve the desired<br/>&gt; &gt; result:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 1.  Only advanced players can vary the dynamics<br/>&gt; &gt; adequately in music played at speed so as the &quot;mixed&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; note is not overly prominent in the mix.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 2.  The perceived average frequency note is not<br/>&gt; &gt; really the seventh harmonic.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 3.  The difference tone leads to the sensation of a<br/>&gt; &gt; very low virtual pitch<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think you just mean a &quot;very low pitch&quot;.</p><p>Do I?  Then perhaps I don&apos;t really know what &quot;virtual<br/>pitch&quot; is.  The name suggests it has no physical reality,<br/>and appears only as a byproduct of the neural<br/>processing we do of the sounds transmitted by the ear.<br/>Is that possible?</p><p>&gt; &gt; which may be at odds with the<br/>&gt; &gt; current harmony, depending on the tuning.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In my experience, a better seventh harmonic effect<br/>&gt; &gt; can be created when playing a C7 tetrad on a 12-EDO<br/>&gt; &gt; piano or keyboard, by playing the Bb as an acciaccatura<br/>&gt; &gt; - a &quot;crushing note&quot; - a short grace note starting simul-<br/>&gt; &gt; taneously with the B.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know why you keep saying Bb &amp; B. Don&apos;t you mean Bb &amp; A? The<br/>&gt; 7th harmonic is closer to A than to B.</p><p>Because they&apos;re the notes I play.

And the<br/>&gt; &gt; fingering requires even more dexterity and dynamic<br/>&gt; &gt; control to get the mix just right.  I figure I&apos;m at best<br/>&gt; &gt; successful only two-thirds of the time ... :-)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, a very interesting sonority with 99EDO can be made of<br/>&gt; &grave;chords&apos; like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; [0,1], [0,1,2], [0,1,2,3], [0,1,3,4], [0,1,2,4,5], etc.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This should lead to an interesting mix of low virtual<br/>&gt; &gt; pitches - almost providing its own bass line!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t know why you say this, Yahya. Perhaps you meant &quot;difference<br/>&gt; tones&quot; instead of &quot;virtual pitches&quot;, ...</p><p>Yes, perhaps I did.</p><p>&gt; ... and also read this post without<br/>&gt; realizing the whole thing referred to 99-equal ...</p><p>Not at all!!!</p><p>&gt; ... (surely you don&apos;t play<br/>&gt; music up in the five-digit Hz range)? ...</p><p>Relevance?  As I&apos;ve pointed out already in another<br/>reply to Hudson, in 99-EDO it&apos;s quite easy to<br/>produce difference tones of ~35Hz, just by playing<br/>notes 3 steps apart in the vicinity of (IIRC) A6.</p><p>&gt; ... And even in 12-equal, only the<br/>&gt; first chord would produce anything like an individuated difference<br/>&gt; tone that could function in a bass line, since the other chords would<br/>&gt; have difference tones doubled at semitone intervals, right?</p><p>I wasn&apos;t talking 12-EDO.  Why did you think I was?!</p><p>&gt; &gt; Do you<br/>&gt; &gt; have a composition we could hear using these chords?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That would surely clarify a lot of things!<br/>&gt; :)</p><p>Hudson has already provided a piece.
