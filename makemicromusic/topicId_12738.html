Not sure if it&apos;s finished yet (I might add a little more to it), but for the upcoming MMM Day I&apos;d like to render it using a different tuning scheme, and I&apos;ve been having trouble finding one that sounds good to me.  I&apos;m not even sure if I&apos;m retuning it right (I&apos;m using Scala).</p><p>Anyway, I thought I&apos;d offer up the midi file for anyone to play with who would like to try their hand at finding a suitable retuning and helping me render it into a sound file.  I&apos;ll share credit with whoever comes up with a solution I like.</p><p>I&apos;m also open to collaborating on the piece itself, if someone is inspired to add to it.  I wrote it in Noteworthy Composer, and I&apos;ll share that file if you want to work with it in that form.</p><p>Here&apos;s the file: <a href="http://mysterybear.net/files/SundayAfternoon.mid">http://mysterybear.net/files/SundayAfternoon.mid</a></p><p>- Dave Seidel<br/><a href="http://mysterybear.net">http://mysterybear.net</a></p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/2/2006 3:33:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dave Seidel &lt;dave@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Anyway, I thought I&apos;d offer up the midi file for anyone to play with<br/>who<br/>&gt; would like to try their hand at finding a suitable retuning and helping<br/>&gt; me render it into a sound file.

All I can really say is that the most important thing to me is to emphasize smoothness in the chords and in the voice leading between the chords (especially in the keyboard part, which is nothing but broken chords).</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Gene Ward Smith wrote:<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dave Seidel &lt;dave@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyway, I thought I&apos;d offer up the midi file for anyone to play with<br/>&gt; who &gt;&gt; would like to try their hand at finding a suitable retuning and helping &gt;&gt; me render it into a sound file.

Since then, I slowed the tempo a bit and changed the keyboard part from harpsichord to piano, so his version will be different from the others.  But if I get at least one or two more versions, I will put them all up with a web page so people can compare and contrast.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>Dave Seidel wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi all,<br/>&gt; &gt; I have this little piece for piano, flute, oboe, and bassoon that I &gt; originally wrote in a while ago in 12TET (key of E major).
