We know that the chinese colonized Madagascar between 100-700 AD with giant vessels that carried up to 400 people.<br/>it was for this reason that i first became interested and worked out some recurrent sequence that worked quite well with their scales. The tunings i past on to Erv and he became interested in especially Mavila. hence his own sequence. otherwise i noticed that it was  formula works quite well for their scales ( i can&apos;t look this up right now). unfortunately they are down to one timbala tuner ( timbala is the name of the ensemble of instruments). My objection is that the name is already taken to describe previous work. possibly it should at least be preceded with something such as Erv use of meta-.</p><p>Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;Also, note there is a linear temperament which used to be called<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;Pelogic, but which is now called Mavila, the natural 5-tone<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;scale of which has alternating 2nds of about 164 and 358 cents.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;I did quite extensive research on the scales of the Chopi including &gt;&gt;correspondence with the son of the man who collected the first<br/>&gt;&gt;tuning  records we have of the them.<br/>&gt;&gt;Mavila is a scale from a Chopi Village of that name.
