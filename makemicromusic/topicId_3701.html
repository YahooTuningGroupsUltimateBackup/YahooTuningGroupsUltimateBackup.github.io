I&apos;m very new to Gigastudio, so this is<br/>&gt; ALL new to me. I&apos;m taking one last summer vacation and when I get<br/>&gt; back, I&apos;ll be putting myself through the paces to learn Gigastudio<br/>&gt; and add this to the mix. The big question is whether I would be able<br/>&gt; to set up a &quot;template&quot; of pitch bended notes that I can use over and<br/>&gt; over, or will every single note I play have to be manually pitch<br/>&gt; bended? Ina ny event, several microtonalists have now answered my<br/>&gt; plea, which is also good news for my prospects for getting Gigastudio<br/>&gt; intpo the microtonal realms in the Version 3.0. I&apos;m very encouraged.<br/>&gt; Woreking on this alone, coming into it cold, has been very isolating,<br/>&gt; and finding a few like-minded souls on the internet is very<br/>&gt; heartwarming!</p><p>Basically it is pretty much like using tuning tables - in fact<br/>a bit easier as you can just enter the scale you want to use<br/>in cents / ratios notation in Fractal Tune Smithy, and then play<br/>in it. So, you don&apos;t need to enter any pitch bends by hand -<br/>you don&apos;t even need to work out the cents deviations<br/>from 12-et.</p><p>The program works out the pitch bends to apply for<br/>every note, and does them all for you. I think it<br/>was Graham Breed who pioneered this approach - and<br/>I came up with it independently in FTS without knowing<br/>about his work. Manuel also does it with SCALA now.</p><p>FTS is freeware / shareware. It&apos;s $31 if one wants to purchase it<br/>for Midi relaying only - I&apos;m making a go at starting up a<br/>business selling my software :-).</p><p>Anyway you can retune pieces of up to ten minutes at a time<br/>for free (after ten minutes playing time you have to exit<br/>the program and start a new session).</p><p>SCALA is completely free.</p><p>Each program has its particular strengths, so you can<br/>try them both out and see which you get along with<br/>best for your way of working (or use both...).</p><p>The home page for fts is<br/><a href="http://tunesmithy.co.uk">http://tunesmithy.co.uk</a></p><p>If you look under Features | Features for<br/>musicians and composes you can read more about<br/>some of the things it can do.</p><p>Yes, it&apos;s great the way that things are shaping up<br/>with various moves in the way of wider support for<br/>microtonal work :-).</p><p>Robert</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 1:21 PM<br/>Subject: [MMM] Digest Number 374</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; [MMM info]------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt; More MMM music files are at <a href="http://www.microtonal.org/music.html">http://www.microtonal.org/music.html</a><br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------[MMM info]<br/>&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are 2 messages in this issue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Topics in this digest:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       1.

I think so, but if not, I have to say I&apos;m<br/>&gt; new to Gigastudio and these samples. The Garritan Strings are<br/>&gt; absolutely fabulous, and so is Garritan harp. I&apos;m not wild about the<br/>&gt; brass and winds out there for soloistic use, tho they sound pretty<br/>&gt; good in a full orchestral texture. Gary Garritan says he is working<br/>&gt; on winds and brass, so I will hold out until he gets his on the<br/>&gt; market.<br/>&gt; East West Sounds has audio CDs full of examples of how these sampled<br/>&gt; sounds can sounhd in the context of complete pieces.<br/>&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>&gt; Chris Mohr<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In MakeMicroMusic@y..., Stan Hoffman &lt;stanhoffman@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Very good news about GigaStudio--I&apos;ve sent them an email<br/>&gt; encouraging them to<br/>&gt; &gt; make it easy for the less technical among us.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Can you recommend a sample library for solo orchestral instruments?<br/>&gt; I have a<br/>&gt; &gt; big project to do quickly and the Xsample solo instruments I have,<br/>&gt; although<br/>&gt; &gt; very good, are not useable &quot;out of the box&quot;--they require a great<br/>&gt; deal of<br/>&gt; &gt; monkeying with to get them to sound right. Unfortunately, this is<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; intimate chamber music texture, so ensemble sounds won&apos;t work.<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Stan<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 2<br/>&gt;    Date: Mon, 19 Aug 2002 14:01:14 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;fromtherealmoftheshadow&quot; &lt;fromtherealmoftheshadow@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Gigastudio Microtonal-friendly, part 2<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi Chris,<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Probably you know this already, and of course tuning table like<br/>&gt; support<br/>&gt; &gt; is much better if one can get it, but just in case it is new to you<br/>&gt; &gt; it may be worth mentioning you can do microtonal work<br/>&gt; &gt; in Giga using pitch bends.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve got a few examples up on my <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> web site.<br/>&gt; Hey Robert,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s potentially great news!

The string<br/>&gt; &gt; quartet is in twelve equal.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The main thing is that many of the instruments are locked<br/>&gt; &gt; with a pitch bend range of 0, and so don&apos;t respond to pitch<br/>&gt; &gt; bends (or the pitch bend wheel), but you can unlock that<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What one does is to go to Edit Instument. Then in the Instrument<br/>&gt; Editor, go to<br/>&gt; &gt; the Instrument Bank, right click on each instrument in turn,<br/>&gt; &gt; look for the Pitch bend (semitones) field, and set this to 2.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now you can retune the Giga instruments using pitch bends<br/>&gt; &gt; in FTS or SCALA. You can also bend the notes using the<br/>&gt; &gt; pitch bend wheel.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
