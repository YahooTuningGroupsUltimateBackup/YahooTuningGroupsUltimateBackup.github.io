With the &gt;&gt;&gt; exception of completing the internal tunings, an extra feature or &gt;&gt;&gt; two, and some documentation, the project is complete.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I see. Well, then, I&apos;ll be happy to download a demo as soon as you &gt;&gt; post a link... ;)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ditto!  Jon&apos;s suggestions for the preset tunings<br/>&gt; are very good, I think.  Please include something<br/>&gt; capable of good barbershop harmony, too!</p><p>The way in which I have produced the LucyTuning tables are always derived from A=440 Hz; so that all LucyTuned instruments (real or virtual) can play with eachother in tune.</p><p>For musicians this make live much easier than other systems, as a LucyTuned C, C# or Cx etc always uses the same name for the same pitch.</p><p>The method I use may require longer and more microtuning files than merely expressing the interval sizes; but it makes it much easier in practice for musicians to use<br/>as they simply set everything to a 12 tone ET A, and then the musos know which notes and chords are playable from the note names.</p><p>This arrangement enables users to write their compositions in regular 12edo midi, and choose the appropriate LucyTuning dependent upon the key of the harmony in the piece.<br/>All &quot;real&quot; musicians seem to immediately understand microtuning when conceptualised in this way, and just select which LucyTuning that they want from the menu.<br/>e.g. 0b5s; 5b0s; 3b2s; etc. as all musos know the circle/spiral of fourths and fifths, and hence the logic of sharps and flats, and can read musical notation.</p><p>I appreciate that this is different to how other systems have been applied in scala and other systems.<br/>Being a musician as much as if not more than an engineer or mathematician; I think like a musician.<br/>As my mother was a musician and music teacher, I was educated in traditional harmony from a very early age, before I could read or even knew my multiplication tables, and many years before I studied and was qualified in engineering.</p><p>Please remember that whatever weird and wonderful maths may be used to calculate microtunings, ultimately it is all about making music;<br/>music is played by musicians;<br/>so please make your microtuning presentations be musician friendly;-)</p><p>Charles Lucy - lucy@...<br/>------------  Promoting global harmony through LucyTuning  -------<br/>for information on LucyTuning go to:  <a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies go to <a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>Buy/download/CD from: <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a></p></div>
