But I want you to know that a couple things have kept me from commenting directly on these 24 pieces:</p><p>1. Zebox isn&apos;t the easiest thing to deal with, in terms of coordinating downloads, what with multiple screens. It does take some time to get them all here (I happen to like dl&apos;ing them and giving a listen in a suite when I&apos;ve got the quiet time).</p><p>2. There isn&apos;t much in terms of description, but boy some of those looked familiar. And knowing that I had turntable pieces, the old music, etc, I thought I&apos;d look through my Stearns folder to see what I already had, and had commented on many moons ago when first posted.</p><p>3. One of my Achilles heels is to get pulled into a technical discussion to, in effect, argue on the side of the artist (as opposed to technician). Done with the best of intentions, but there you go.</p><p>I actually thought you had some kind of rotating image deal going on that page, but I think I must have been one of the first to visit, and then at some point you changed to the picture of the score. Which maybe your son did his magic on.</p><p>I&apos;ll try to get some cogent thoughts together, but it may not be immediate. Empty-headed blather is always much easier. I also hope that others give a listen, too - they might not know what they are missing.</p><p>What I WILL heartily second is where did the energy go from MMM day????? What about Jacob and Prent and all the contributors - no commentary after the fact? Is that all there is? Are we back to stasis already?</p><p>Off to mend my ways...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=13141 href="#13141">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/27/2006 10:38:45 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>At 08:29 PM 4/27/2006, you wrote:<br/>&gt;last saturday i posted about a site i had just put online featuring 24<br/>&gt;microtonal compositions.

I started posting to<br/>these forums back in the late 90s and steadily saw my enthusiasm wane<br/>due to this to the point where i hardly ever post anymore; and as you<br/>may or may not know, this very forum was a kind of splinter group<br/>brought about by some people in the community/cult who had a similar<br/>feeling. I know it&apos;s harder to talk about the actual music than it is<br/>about the terminology and that like, but i participate in quite a few<br/>other forums where this kind of disproportion just doesn&apos;t happen,<br/>ever. everybody who composes enough and posts enough music online<br/>ought to be used to the feast and famine of responses, and i&apos;m no<br/>different there and don&apos;t really have a problem with that per se.
