Things are going well. I&apos;m back in the San Francisco area and am collaborating with Naut Humon / Asphodel (<a href="http://www.asphodel.com">www.asphodel.com</a>).  I recently did my 1st live electronic music performance in Santa Cruz:<br/><a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/live/">http://catharsis.egregious.net/live/</a></p><p>I have made some headway on a new component oriented software environment for synthesis and compositional control; it is called SCREAM and is Java based. I used the alpha version of the first SCREAM module (a granular sampler) for my live performance.  Here is some very tentative early info:<br/><a href="http://audio.egregious.net/scream/">http://audio.egregious.net/scream/</a><br/>I&apos;ll be updating it when I have time.</p><p>At first I am targeting SCREAM for use with SuperCollider3, but any combination of OSC (or MIDI) enabled environments is game (SC/Reaktor/Max/PD, etc.).</p><p>Real soon I will annex JMSL into the SCREAM environment and have it working with SC3. This will be big news for JMSL!</p><p>Eventually I&apos;ll have to get in touch with Monz and others on creating specific microtonal oriented SCREAM modules.  At some point there will be an open API for module development.</p><p>Anyway... Hope you guys like my 1st live performance. It is very microtonal, but in an unstructured way. As always, I am sitting on a fully stocked studio and would be glad to assist any microtonal composer with mastering/audio engineering... Perhaps you guys can get a CD together...</p><p>Best,<br/>--Mike</p><p>Egregious<br/>&quot;Spiritual renewal through music for those outside the heard.&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.egregious.net/">http://www.egregious.net/</a></p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/15/2003 12:19:29 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mike,</p><p>Good to hear from you again!</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Catharsis &lt;catharsis@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I recently did my 1st live electronic music<br/>&gt; performance in Santa Cruz:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://catharsis.egregious.net/live/">http://catharsis.egregious.net/live/</a></p><p>I&apos;ll check it out...</p><p>&gt; for synthesis and compositional control; it is called SCREAM and<br/>&gt; is Java based.

I believe he was supposed to premier one of his works in May or June that I helped out with (a little audio engineering on the electronic part)..</p><p>&gt;Aargh! Java based but targeting a Mac app? :) Oh, well, you hint that you&apos;ll broaden out, and I hope in your design (and later, implementation) you can keep as much platform-independent Java functionality as possible.</p><p>Heh heh.. I currently run SCREAM on my PC and connect to SC3/Mac via a crossover cable.</p><p>Well, there is an active group that is porting SC3 to Linux. Currently I believe they have the DSP engine ported, but not the SC3 Language (programming part). The neat thing about what I am doing is that my environment works directly with the SC3 DSP engine and bypasses SC Lang entirely.  You still have access to SCLang if you choose to use it as both the DSP engine / Lang are available by OSC communication.<br/>So apparently you could run the SC3 DSP engine on Linux with SCREAM; though I haven&apos;t tested it yet and won&apos;t have time allotted for that for a couple of months. It should be possible though.</p><p>The next synthesis environment I will be targeting is Reaktor4. Between Reaktor/SC3/SCREAM/analog gear/post production (Nuendo, plugins, etc.) I will be content and have my hands full for a while!</p><p>SCREAM itself is component based where the components communicate via OSC to the target synthesis environment, so it should be mostly platform independent.</p><p>&gt;Is it just SC3 that is an enticing front-end for you? From what I&apos;ve &gt;gathered on the JMSL list, I had the impression that most of those folks &gt;were non-Mac. No matter, and it is still art/music types that have more &gt;Macs than anyone else, but there is a whole world of cheap laptops waiting &gt;for more good apps to do live, creative sound/music. Just ask the many &gt;people using AudioMulch, among other apps.</p><p>There are cheap Mac laptops too.. ;)    I&apos;m lucky as I have an ok Mac on loan currently; thus my SC experience.   I really like SC3.. SC2 was neat, but SC3 takes the cake for the freedom allowed in its usage; It is allowing me to work via SCREAM directly with the DSP engine. This is very cool. I can&apos;t think of a more cutting edge DSP environment at the moment.</p><p>I did complete a proof of concept component oriented framework for SC2 called CIS (Control Interface Synthesis). I took it as far as I felt necessary to learn the SC2 language and environment before hitting up SC3... I then promptly dropped CIS and started SCREAM once I realized what was going on with SC3.   If I continued to use SC2 though I would pursue the CIS angle.</p><p>If you have SC2/OS9 CIS has a few interesting components for microtonal control; some via a 1st order markov chain.<br/><a href="http://audio.egregious.net/sc2/cis/">http://audio.egregious.net/sc2/cis/</a></p><p>&gt;That would be great - I&apos;ve asked Nick before about microtonal support for &gt;JMSL, but it seems few or no people are interested in micro work in that &gt;community.</p><p>I had a nice little chat with Nick and Phil Burke last week when Nick was performing in the SF Bay Area. It appears Nick is all for getting JMSL to work with SCREAM/SC3 and I&apos;ll be getting to it in a month or so.</p><p>My goal (vision is more like it!) with SCREAM is to provide a framework where all current areas of compositional theory/practice can be combined and explored. Creating this framework is not necessarily creating new compositional theory/techniques, but I think it certainly could lead to something new through a synthesis of theory/implementation.</p><p>One of my projects with SCREAM is to create a new performance oriented spatialization environment for a 16.4 sound system. Eventually I will most likely be using Java3D for an interface (in the interim I will be doing a psuedo 3D interface via 2D).</p><p>I&apos;d really like to explore creating a 3D interface to realize organization of microtonal concepts.  I kind of got inspired for this direction by Erv Wilson&apos;s brief talk at the microtonal conference back a couple of years. I think it could lead to some wild results.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t know about the last part, but if you&apos;re willing to answer &gt;questions &apos;publically&apos;, I&apos;ll post them here (in case others benefit from &gt;your information); otherwise, I&apos;ve got a couple of questions for you off-line!</p><p>No problem.. I am about to actually get my first record pressed as well. I can cover all premastering for this process and I certain the results will be nice!</p><p>&gt;One last request: for those on dialups, any chance you might find it<br/>&gt;possible to pick a couple of excerpts of a few minutes in length and post<br/>&gt;those?

Yes, _Blacklight_ was premiered a couple of<br/>weeks ago (May 29) with a superb cellist, Dan Barrett and your<br/>wonderful renderings, which helped a lot.  The audio sounded great in<br/>the hall....  We even got a little pre-concert publicity for the<br/>composition in the New Yorker (it mentioned the Blackjack scale...)</p><p>I&apos;ll get in touch with you again when I need more processing, to see<br/>if you&apos;re around and still interested...
