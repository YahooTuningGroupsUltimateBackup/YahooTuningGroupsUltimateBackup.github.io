On the other hand,<br/>saying &quot;it was crap&quot; and that&apos;s it, isn&apos;t very interesting to read either.</p><p>Maybe we should start a list called &quot;tuning-whipping&quot;, where everyone agrees<br/>that they are willing to be WHIPPED by the other members of the group, if<br/>they: 1) post bad music,  or 2) make lame, pronouncement-with-no-details<br/>posts.  You could also make a rule that any time music is posted, everyone<br/>must listen and post about it, positive or negative.  What&apos;s the answer to<br/>annoying flame wars??  Fan the flames!!!  Fight fire. . .with fire!!!!!!!!</p><p>--<br/>--------------------------------------------<br/>Christopher Bailey<br/>chris@...<br/>zipzappoozoo@...<br/><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
