It seems like<br/>it would be incredibly easy using something like the Arduino<br/>Duemilanove, which is programmable in C/C++ and uses an AVR<br/>microcontroller (<a href="http://www.arduino.cc">http://www.arduino.cc</a>). If you don&apos;t know about the<br/>Arduino, and you know even a little bit of C or C++, you should<br/>definitely check it out. It makes microcontroller programming<br/>incredibly easy. And, it&apos;s fun! (tm)</p><p>The only thing holding me back from this is that I&apos;m not sure what we<br/>could use as a keyboard to do it. I&apos;m only acquainted with the<br/>Bosanquet and Fokker keyboard layouts, and so far I haven&apos;t found any<br/>commonly available, cheap panel of buttons to cannibalize for this<br/>project to match either layout. Does anyone have any ideas? I&apos;ve<br/>thrown around the idea of perhaps destroying a computer keyboard and<br/>setting it up in some kind of pseudo-Bosanquet fashion but it seems<br/>like a pretty lame option. Does anyone know of any products -<br/>children&apos;s toys, perhaps - that have a large bunch of buttons laid out<br/>in an array that would be suitable for such a purpose?</p><p>-Mike</p></div>
