They&apos;re not wrong in the sense of out-of tune or amiss like an inaccurate pianist - just wrong in the way someone suggested Stravinsky was a cubist composer. See Donald Mitchell the Language of Modern Music -the chapter &apos;Cross currents with Cubism&apos;.</p><p>For my own opinion on microtonality - I feel that when a microtonal (non 12EDO I suppose) context should enhance the rightness of the vertical and linear connections - there should be no sense of being &apos;wonkily out of tune&apos;. Some cultivate this wonkiness, but it detracts from the music in the end - it&apos;s merely effect. IMHO.</p><p>can anyone who wants to hear the &apos;wonky&apos; waltz, please email me again - lost the last digest due to finger trouble.</p><p>Mark</p></div>
