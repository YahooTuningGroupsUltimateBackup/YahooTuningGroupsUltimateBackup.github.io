I was messing<br/>around with gamelan tunings, then decided the Harrison JI tuning was<br/>more in-your-face microtonal.  Nobody seemed to notice.  Probably<br/>because of the reportedly amusing video of a little girl chasing a<br/>little boy that was playing on a projection screen behind me during<br/>my performance.</p><p>Paolo</p></div>
