Please note that the total duration of the work including silence may NOT exceed sixty seconds.</p><p>The 60x60 project&apos;s definition of a record work is as follows: any work created as a musical composition which is captured on recorded media, which does not require live performers for its production in broadcast at concert halls, radio, multi-media, etc. Its creation can include but not limited to acoustic instruments, voice, environmental sources, and computer (Sampling, MIDI, C Sound, ProTools, etc.)</p><p>Acoustic compositions should be submitted with the understanding that it is their recording that is of prime importance and is what will be used to determine its selection. Scores of works are strongly discouraged and will not be used in the selection process.</p><p>60x60 is a project of &quot;signature works&quot; and short works created specifically for the 60x60 project. Excerpts of larger works are strongly discouraged.<br/>Works generated from procedures (i.e. mathematical matrices, organizational systems, or computer programs,) remixed works, or themes and motives recomposed from other of the composer&apos;s own work are acceptable.</p><p>The call is open to composers of any nationality, age, or career stage.<br/>Works submitted must not have been previously performed or broadcasted.
