The main tuning list didn&apos;t hold my interest one bit.</p><p>It&apos;s not like I am writing a lot of music as I&apos;m focused on some interesting software development, but whenever I do it&apos;s microtonal related.  So, dropping in here periodically and chatting about what I&apos;m working on is cool.. All this software stuff will eventually get around to some cool microtonal music tools.</p><p>I&apos;d be glad to follow on to any particular new email list. I can offer a couple of directions though.</p><p>Check out the Microtonal Music tribe on <a href="http://tribe.net">tribe.net</a> if so inclined: <a href="http://microtonal.tribe.net/">http://microtonal.tribe.net/</a><br/>~70 folks are on there, but discussion is low. Some folks from MMM post there.  Heck.. I was rather surprised as out of the 3 tribes I created including Music-DSP, and SuperCollider the tuning one has nearly twice the membership as music-dsp and the SC one has the least with ~30.</p><p>I also am running Mailman on my personal server (<a href="http://egregious.net">egregious.net</a> and <a href="http://auriga3d.org">auriga3d.org</a>).  For free we could run <a href="http://tuning.egregious.net">tuning.egregious.net</a> or <a href="http://tuning.auriga3d.org">tuning.auriga3d.org</a> with a private mailing list and web page.  Any other name would be suitable except the top level domain. For a small fee of getting a domain I could register something cool and microtonal related. I&apos;d probably put some sort of bandwidth limitation on the site, but it will be just fine for the mail list and web page. Perhaps even limited hosting of audio files, but I think linking audio files from the mail list and web page to free file caches will be sufficient and make things more maintainable (cost free) yet still have a private list / strong identity on the web.</p><p>Best,<br/>--Mike</p><p>Lead Developer,<br/>Scream: <a href="http://audio.egregious.net/scream/">http://audio.egregious.net/scream/</a><br/>Auriga3D: <a href="http://www.auriga3d.org/">http://www.auriga3d.org/</a></p></div>
