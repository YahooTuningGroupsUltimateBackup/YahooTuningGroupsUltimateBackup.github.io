Some of you may have previously seen earlier versions of these pages which were up on my former faculty space several years ago. In that case you will be happy to know that all the graphics have been updated. The relatively small amount of text remains almost the same. Loading of these pages may be slow, as there are lots of graphics on some of them. Feedback and suggestions welcome as always. See the grey menubar for the new pages:</p><p><a href="http://www.h-pi.com/MSCintro.html">http://www.h-pi.com/MSCintro.html</a></p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron Hunt<br/>H-Pi Instruments</p></div>
