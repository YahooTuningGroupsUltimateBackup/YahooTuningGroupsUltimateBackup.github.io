I&apos;ve been<br/>corresponding with a support person at Peterson about their tuners, having<br/>thought I would go for the VSAM when it comes out. However, he suggests that<br/>for microtuning percussion instruments, the mechanical strobe is far<br/>superior. I&apos;ll append a few of his comments below. Just wondering whether<br/>this sounds accurate to people on this list--or whether he&apos;s just trying to<br/>sell me a more expensive solution.</p><p>Many thanks,</p><p>Stan</p><p>-------<br/>... I would urge you to consider a real strobe. For percussion nothing else<br/>really works.  I speak from experience, I worked with German experimental<br/>band Einst&uuml;rzende Neubauten for 10 years (among other types the instruments<br/>we built were metal, plastic, and electronic percussive, stringed and wind<br/>instruments tuned to many different intonation systems). I could not have<br/>done it without a mechanical strobe tuner.</p><p>The advantage of the mechanical strobe over other types (including VS-1 &amp;<br/>V-SAM) is that the display offers much more information about the sound<br/>being analysed. Other tuners pick out the dominant partial and attempt to<br/>display that, since in the area of tuned percussion, the signal&acute;s complexity<br/>causes that dominant partial to jump around quite a bit (at least in raw<br/>non-tuned form) you will be frustrated by the erratic readout of a<br/>non-Strobe display as it tries unsucessfully to keep up! A mechanical strobe<br/>however, can handle more than one tone and can even display simultaneously<br/>in some cases. It also shows you the amplitude or intensity of the different<br/>constituents of a tone, and after a while you will recognise tonal<br/>characteristics visually as well as aurally. A real strobe has much more<br/>programming and memory capacity, and the readout is much more suitable for<br/>non 12TET systems.</p><p>This is why percussion manufacturers such as Musser, Ludwig, Marimba One,<br/>Malletech, Ross Mallet, Sabian Cymbals, Sonor etc. and almost all Steelpan<br/>builders and Tap-tuners favor the mechanical strobe.<br/>....</p></div>
