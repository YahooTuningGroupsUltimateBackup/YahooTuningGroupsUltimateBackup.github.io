Well, I dl&apos;d the thing and listened to it, and I do have a question: one of the problems of a raw midi sequence is that the end listener will be hearing it played on who-knows-what kind of output, everything from a very cheezy soundcard to a midi-out to a sophisticated synth.</p><p>Mine, going to a mid-level sound card (some form of SB Live), went to a generic &quot;sax&quot; sound, but the weird thing is that the timbre changed almost constantly, from very smooth, &quot;Paul Desmond&quot;-like tones to very raw, honky baritone sax sounds, with a lot of reed buzz. Is this a phenomena that occurs as the tuning itself, as evidence in the harmonies generated through contrapuntal lines, causes the tonal qualities of the soundcard samples/synth-voices to change?</p><p>Either it is a by-product of the tuning, or an anomaly. Even if it is either, is it remarkably the same across all different manner of playback devices, or could it be radically different from card to card, computer to computer, and synth to synth? And, if so, is this *good* thing, a *bad* thing, or a completely *inconsequential* thing (speaking as the composer of the piece, that is)?</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=2814 href="#2814">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/3/2002 9:26:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;Jonathan M.

I *should* have looked at the raw midi data first, and realized that you had assigned different instrument patches! I got confused as the description said &quot;sax quartet&quot;, and thought that the varying timbres (which were nothing more than the differing instrument sample/patches) were caused by the tuning. As they say, &quot;never mind&quot;...</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m no expert, but I can say that the results with this piece did seem to &gt;depend to an unusual extent on the samples being used.

In any event, the wild variables of sound cards cause me to never release things in raw midi files, unless a single timbre file would be illustrative of an effect, harmony, or other that would be independent of the *sound* that someone would hear. And your explanation of the reasoning of sending it this way (ala Graham&apos;s comments, etc.) makes sense.</p><p>&gt;I suppose Cage would think it is wonderful; I&apos;m inclinded to regard it as &gt;a pain in the ear.</p><p>In pain there is pleasure? :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
