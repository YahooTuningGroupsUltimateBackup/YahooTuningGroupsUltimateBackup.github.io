Group, a forum for<br/>tonal music enthusiasts. George Pepper is a former member bounced from<br/>the list for the following post. (Rick informs me that reading this post<br/>required joining the list.)</p><p>George considers himself the ultimate authority on all matters musical,<br/>and is contemptuous of alternate tuning buffs. He resorts to highly<br/>personal invective when someone doesn&apos;t acknowledge the &quot;truthiness&quot; of<br/>his opinions. Here is his last post in its entirety:</p><p>Jon,</p><p>Not only is your ass showing, but your Freudian slip as well.<br/>Now, I&apos;ve only attended the Guitar Institute, where I studied with dolts<br/>like Herb Ellis and Pat Martino; and Berklee College of Music, where I<br/>earned a lowly Professional Music degree; my experience with rock bands<br/>only lead to a handful of appearances on MTV (Which I&apos;m sure would be<br/>beneath your dignity); then, I programmed most of the factory sound<br/>effect presets for New England Digital&apos;s Synclavier Digital Music System<br/>(Where I became intimately acquainted with the overtone series in a way<br/>you&apos;ll never understand, and had my name enshrined in their user manual,<br/>as well as my sounds used in everything from Star Trek: TNG to Firefly);<br/>and of course, I later earned a worthless master&apos;s degree from a little<br/>school in Texas nobody has ever heard of, after which I recorded a CD of<br/>twenty-seven classical pieces I wrote all by my lonesome, performing<br/>them as well.  Now, I was going to try to keep this response to a single<br/>sentence, but I believe that one has run on long enough.  Nowadays I<br/>simply have a management contract and endorsements with a guitar<br/>manufacturer, a guitar electronics manufacturer, and a software company.<br/>I&apos;m sure your list of endorsements makes mine pale into insignificance<br/>by comparison, and I&apos;m sure you make a lot more money performing than I<br/>do.  In fact, I&apos;m sure you are enjoying a stellar career... just not in<br/>music.<br/>I&apos;m sorry that I understand the overtone series better than you do.  I<br/>know you wish you were the greatest interpreter of the series&apos;<br/>implications in all of music history, but you aren&apos;t.  In fact, Jon, you<br/>aren&apos;t worthy to eat the peanuts out of my poop; by any measure of a<br/>musician, by any measure of a man, by any measure of a human being, by<br/>any measure of anything - and my poop would be brain-food for you.<br/>Judging from the off-list interactions I have with other Delians, I&apos;m<br/>far from alone in understanding this truism, and I&apos;m far from alone in<br/>wishing that you would just take your insignificant musical flailings,<br/>dry up with them, and blow the hell away.<br/>I&apos;ve tried humoring you, but you are obviously determined to remain<br/>willfully ignorant, so I can&apos;t help you.  One thing I have become over<br/>the years is butthole-intolerant, Jon, and you are a gaping maw of a<br/>bleating, butthole: You yell out of your butt at the top of your lungs,<br/>and I just have no time for your pre-pubescent bullcrap anymore.  If I<br/>were the moderator of this group, your sub-basement IQ&apos;d rear-end would<br/>have been tossed out of here long ago, but I&apos;m not.  So, being the<br/>butthole-intolerant, yet magnanimous person that I am, I&apos;m going to give<br/>you sole ass-hat stewardship of the Delian group.  I&apos;m tired of tossing<br/>my pearls before swine like you, but perhaps this is the only place<br/>where you will be tolerated.  It&apos;s yours.<br/>Read commandments nine and ten sometime, Jon.  I&apos;ve encountered<br/>covetous, jealous piles of excrement like you before (Reading the<br/>letters of Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven leads me to believe this<br/>experience is near-universal among musicians with talent), and I&apos;m sure<br/>I&apos;ll have the pleasure again.<br/>You&apos;ll die knowing you are less than nothing next to me, Jon, and this<br/>is as it should be.<br/>Next time you want a laugh, Jon, take a long look in a mirror.  That<br/>ought to do it.<br/>Sorry Delians, but every now and then in life one has to rip the head<br/>off of a butthole and poop down his throat.<br/>You should have read the first draft. LOL!<br/>Adios muchachos.  Yo Finito.<br/>Jorge Jalapeno.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=15735 href="#15735">ðŸ”—</a>Prent Rodgers &#x3C;prentrodgers@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/21/2007 8:58:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jon,<br/>This has to be the most over the top exit-note from a mailing list<br/>ever written.
