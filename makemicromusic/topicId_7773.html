But<br/>I&apos;m very happy with the piece and what&apos;s a date anyway; surely<br/>nothing in the larger scope of appreciating Ives&apos; unique and timeless<br/>contributions!</p><p>Technically speaking, there&apos;s a lot going on in this piece, but I&apos;d<br/>like to take the time to call attention to one aspect in particular.<br/>Over the Rivers is composed in 11-tone equal temperament. This<br/>tuning, and other tunings like it, are routinely mentioned by<br/>theorists as atonal or discordant tunings with little or no practical<br/>purpose. This is simply not the case,and I intentionally kept this<br/>piece on the threshold of tonality just to accentuate the unique<br/>beauty these &quot;atonal&quot; and &quot;discordant&quot;  tunings can express if one<br/>takes the time to look...</p><p><a href="http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/">http://zebox.com/daniel_anthony_stearns/</a></p><p>Thanks,<br/>Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=7774 href="#7774">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2004 11:41:06 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>By popular request, I&apos;ve put up an ogg file of two-thrds of the 13tet piece, _Change of Regime_.</p><p><a href="http://home.snafu.de/djwolf/ChangeOfRegime.ogg">home.snafu.de/djwolf/ChangeOfRegime.ogg</a> (1.32mb, 2&apos;22&quot;)</p><p>I&apos;ll post a score and a complete audio file when I have figured out a more plausible notation than that used for composing the piece.<br/>Daniel Wolf</p></div><h3><a id=7775 href="#7775">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Wolf &#x3C;djwolf1@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/12/2004 11:47:55 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>daniel_anthony_stearns wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Over the Rivers is composed in 11-tone equal temperament.

For example, I find the 11tet leading tone to be resolutely directional in both purely melodic and harmonic settings (although I&apos;ll add the caveat that I haven&apos;t been able to get 11 or 13 to work &quot;tonally&quot; in textures with much more than 2 tones at once, but I&apos;d venture to guess that that&apos;s more likely due to a deficit in my technique that to anything intrinsic in either tuning).   And the remark abour the &quot;serial composer&quot; strikes me as odd, because -- excepting some Webern and perhaps some Goeyvaerts -- I don&apos;t know of any serial music where key centers are undefined, but I know a lot of serial music that either enjoys or suffers an overabundance of key centers, and I don&apos;t reckon that 11tet will alter this quality.  Might I be excused for making a theoretical observation (albeit a very low -level one) on this list?  Following some work in 11 and 13, I have observed that these tunings, when compared to 12, shift weights among the intervallic neighborhoods with regard to their tonality-defining characters.   The intervals in the middle of the octave strongly define tonal motion in 12, while 11 and 13 are defined more by intervals in the 2nd and 4th fifths of the octave. The &quot;seconds&quot; in all three tunings are strongly tonal, strongly directional, at least in their most local melodic forms.</p><p>DJW</p></div><h3><a id=7787 href="#7787">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/13/2004 3:56:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I am constantly amazed at what sounds good for no apparent reason ( and vice versa too i must add).

These<br/>utilities may exist in earlier versions of these OS&apos;s too.</p><p>If you&apos;re using a Unix-based OS such as Linux I hope that a search on<br/>either &quot;Character Map&quot; or &quot;Character Palette&quot; will reveal a suitable<br/>utility.</p><p>These utilities can be used with Finale and other programs that don&apos;t<br/>have their own symbol palettes.</p><p>If you happen to have Microsoft Word running on your OS, then as a<br/>second-last resort you could presumably use its character palette to<br/>obtain the desired Sagittal symbol and then cut and paste it into<br/>your notation software.</p><p>As a last resort you may have to search the web for a third-party<br/>utility like PopChar <a href="http://www.ergonis.com/products/popchar/">http://www.ergonis.com/products/popchar/</a></p><p>For Microsoft Word you simply choose Insert/Symbol and choose<br/>Sagittal from the Font menu in the palette window that pops up.</p><p>In Sibelius it&apos;s a little more involved. You choose House Style/Edit<br/>Symbols then click Music Fonts, then New and Yes. Then type the<br/>word &quot;Sagittal&quot; and choose Sagittal from the Font menu and click OK<br/>and Close. You only have to do that part once, just to let Sibelius<br/>know that Sagittal is a music font. Now back at the symbol editing<br/>window you double-click a blank cell on the palette and choose<br/>Sagittal from the Music Font menu. Then you will see a palette of<br/>Sagittal symbols to choose from.</p><p>However, thanks to Jacob Barton there is a much simpler way to use<br/>the most common Sagittal symbols with Sibelius, via his scripts and<br/>saved House Styles, which he has kindly allowed us to provide for<br/>free on the Sagittal website. I&apos;m hoping to obtain an updated version<br/>from him in the next day or so.</p><p>Jacob&apos;s script allows you to insert a Sagittal symbol by typing either<br/>a) an ASCII character that somewhat resembles it (available for the<br/>most common symbols only), (see the &quot;mixed short ASCII&quot; column in the<br/>table) or<br/>b) a series of ASCII characters that represent the various kinds of<br/>half-arrowheads and shafts making up the Sagittal symbol (see<br/>the &quot;pure long ASCII&quot; column).</p><p>We&apos;re happy to work with anyone considering Sagittal, to ensure that<br/>it&apos;s as easy as possible for you. If you can&apos;t find the information<br/>or tools you need on the Sagittal website, don&apos;t hesitate to ask.</p><p>-- Dave Keenan</p></div><h3><a id=7835 href="#7835">ðŸ”—</a>Prent Rodgers &#x3C;prentrodgers@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/15/2004 12:19:12 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan,<br/>This is a terrific piece.

It has<br/>&gt; marvelous way of leading to expectations of tones. Then what we hear<br/>&gt; is not what we expect, which is jarring. But then the tone is so sweet<br/>&gt; and pleasant and the pitch makes sense for a second. And then there&apos;s<br/>&gt; another note we have to somehow come to grips with. Which we do. It is<br/>&gt; like a very gentle dance walking on rocks across a steam. You have to<br/>&gt; be careful to step in the right place, or risk getting wet and cold.<br/>&gt; And then you stop on the way and realize where you are, in a very<br/>&gt; beautiful spot. I have really enjoyed this work.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks for the kind words.  Your description of your listening experience mirrors very closely the way in which 9tet unraveled itself during composition.  Some pieces take lots of work, this one almost wrote itself. (Actuall, the hardest part of composing was editing out two phrases.  I had originally written nine time nine measures of music plus a cadence, but I felt it needed to be thrown off a bit, and figuring out how to do that was hard.)</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not so fond of the string quartet, but I bet it has much more<br/>&gt; drama in person than online.

If anything, the quartet resists the dramatic, with a pace like East Asian court music and the battuto playing defintely helps with the comparison.  The piece is notated only in whole notes with a very slow tempo, so any faster rhythmic activity is essentially a surface accident.  The strangest thing about the piece is that Americans tell me it sounds &quot;European&quot;, and Europeans tell me it sounds &quot;American&quot;.  (As if those adjectives meant anything pin-downable).</p><p>Best,</p><p>Daniel</p></div><h3><a id=7932 href="#7932">ðŸ”—</a>Prent Rodgers &#x3C;prentrodgers@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/23/2004 1:42:05 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Daniel Wolf, composer of the Un-Pin-Downable.
