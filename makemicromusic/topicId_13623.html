So it is possible. Not a good idea, but possible.</p><p>&gt; +++++++++++ OK. I don&apos;t remember hearing a beat in old<br/>&gt;            music. Rhythm and beat are synonyms, right?</p><p>Well, sort of. If you listen to the first Prelude from the WTC, it has<br/>a very steady pulse. In other works (say... Musical Offering Ricercar<br/>a 6) the beat is less obvious because there isn&apos;t a rhythm section to<br/>articulate every downbeat, as we&apos;re familiar with. There&apos;s still a<br/>very clear meter, though, and that doesn&apos;t go away until the arhythmic<br/>and ametric leanings of modern music.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  There is a low likelihood that the chord of F# major<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  would be used here. This is all I meant. This is what<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;  you mean by guidelines, right, stuff like that?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Basically... except that by that definition, a strange chord would<br/>&gt; be<br/>&gt; &gt; defined as a freak accident (like flipping a coin to heads 100<br/>&gt; times<br/>&gt; &gt; in a row).  But in music, defying a &quot;guideline&quot; isn&apos;t a matter of<br/>&gt; &gt; probability, but a purposeful statement with a definite intention<br/>&gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; a deliberate effect.  Make sense?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; +++++++++  Yes if one knows what one is doing. If a melody line<br/>&gt;           in a given measure has certain notes, the chord that is in<br/>&gt;           effect then (for lack of better phrasing) will likely<br/>&gt;           be one of X number. The top 50% of the chords that<br/>&gt;           be. It is unlikley that it will be in the bottom 50%.<br/>&gt;           F# major in my example.<br/>&gt;           If I can maintance some motavation for this theory<br/>&gt;           stuff, I think I should learn the most likely<br/>&gt;           possibilities first.</p><p>That&apos;s a gross oversimplification, see. If I have a melody line that<br/>goes &quot;a c c e g c&quot; then for a really consonant minor sound I&apos;d put it<br/>in a minor. But if I want a more dramatic effect, I might have the<br/>underlying chord be C Major, or even d# diminished depending on the<br/>sound I want. d#dim with that note line would sound very dissonant and<br/>might have the effect of destroying the tonal sense of the piece for a<br/>moment, I&apos;d use that as a transitional point to take off in a<br/>completely different direction.</p><p>I find that theory is fun to play with, but when I&apos;m writing music I<br/>go more by how something sounds than what its theoretical importance<br/>is.</p><p>--TRISTAN<br/>(<a href="http://dreamingofeden.smackjeeves.com/">http://dreamingofeden.smackjeeves.com/</a>)</p></div><h3>Chuckk Hubbard &#x3C;BadMuthaHubbard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/19/2006 2:54:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.Smith&quot; &lt;jsmith9624@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Any tone can succeed any other tone, any tone can sound<br/>simultaneously<br/>&gt; with any other tone or tones, and any group of tones can be<br/>followed by<br/>&gt; any other group of tones, just as any degree of tension or nuance<br/>can<br/>&gt; occur in any medium under any kind of stress or duration.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Successful projection will depend upon the contextual and formal<br/>&gt; conditions that prevail, and upon the skill and soul of the<br/>composer.&quot;<br/>&gt; -- Vincent Persichetti, &quot;20th-Century Harmony&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Everything in the Universe is permitted....but not everything<br/>&gt; permitted, is edifying.&quot;  -- unknown<br/>&gt;</p><p>My freshman theory teacher studied with Persichetti.

Talk about<br/>&gt; BALLS!!! Talk about the invention of rock! This music still is way<br/>&gt; hipper than any rock music you could throw at me. Light years<br/>&gt; beyond, and full of great intense rhythm. Rhythm that could move<br/>you<br/>&gt; to jump around energetically, body music, but way more intelligent,<br/>&gt; sophisticated, and emotionally deep than *any* rock ever was.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Most rock music is utter garbage, a least common denominator music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The exceptions (generally prog rock like Yes, King Crimson, Gentle<br/>&gt; Giant, some Floyd, some Beatles) prove the rule.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Nothing nowadays anyway seems any good. It had a peak in the 70s<br/>and<br/>&gt; died hard in the 80&apos;s.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I confess a fondness for some U2 however, especially their latest<br/>&gt; stuff, which is no longer I and IV chords exclusively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Aaron.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Lol, while reading this my first thought was &quot;come on, what<br/>about &apos;Owner of a Lonely Heart&apos;&quot;, but I see you mentioned Yes.  Frank<br/>Zappa was the greatest, though, receiving commission offers from all<br/>sorts of orchestras.  He was a monster.</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2006 3:55:23 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>TRISTAN</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; On 6/14/06, stephenszpak &lt;stephen_szpak@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;             Also was wondering if rock could exist 100&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;             of years ago.

I&apos;m going to have to start<br/>                writing these groups down. I have recently<br/>                started &quot;serious&quot; listening, if that is the<br/>                word for it, at Pandora. I hardly listened to<br/>                rock/pop at all for about 15 years or more.<br/>                I missed a lot of songs.</p><p>&gt; &gt; +++++++++++ OK. I don&apos;t remember hearing a beat in old<br/>&gt; &gt;            music. Rhythm and beat are synonyms, right?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well, sort of. If you listen to the first Prelude from the WTC, it<br/>has<br/>&gt; a very steady pulse. In other works (say... Musical Offering<br/>Ricercar<br/>&gt; a 6) the beat is less obvious because there isn&apos;t a rhythm section<br/>to<br/>&gt; articulate every downbeat, as we&apos;re familiar with. There&apos;s still a<br/>&gt; very clear meter, though, and that doesn&apos;t go away until the<br/>arhythmic<br/>&gt; and ametric leanings of modern music.</p><p>++++++++++ Sorry. I don&apos;t know what you are talking about.<br/>           I think I should start by listening to:</p><p>           &quot;the first Prelude from the WTC&quot;</p><p>           If this was just mentioned I just missed it.<br/>           Is a link available?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  There is a low likelihood that the chord of F# major<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  would be used here. This is all I meant. This is what<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  you mean by guidelines, right, stuff like that?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Basically... except that by that definition, a strange chord<br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; defined as a freak accident (like flipping a coin to heads 100<br/>&gt; &gt; times<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in a row).  But in music, defying a &quot;guideline&quot; isn&apos;t a matter<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; probability, but a purposeful statement with a definite<br/>intention<br/>&gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a deliberate effect.  Make sense?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; +++++++++  Yes if one knows what one is doing. If a melody line<br/>&gt; &gt;           in a given measure has certain notes, the chord that<br/>is in<br/>&gt; &gt;           effect then (for lack of better phrasing) will likely<br/>&gt; &gt;           be one of X number. The top 50% of the chords that<br/>&gt; &gt;           be. It is unlikley that it will be in the bottom 50%.<br/>&gt; &gt;           F# major in my example.<br/>&gt; &gt;           If I can maintance some motavation for this theory<br/>&gt; &gt;           stuff, I think I should learn the most likely<br/>&gt; &gt;           possibilities first.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; That&apos;s a gross oversimplification, see. If I have a melody line<br/>that<br/>&gt; goes &quot;a c c e g c&quot; then for a really consonant minor sound I&apos;d put<br/>it<br/>&gt; in a minor. But if I want a more dramatic effect, I might have the<br/>&gt; underlying chord be C Major, or even d# diminished depending on the<br/>&gt; sound I want. d#dim with that note line would sound very dissonant<br/>and<br/>&gt; might have the effect of destroying the tonal sense of the piece<br/>for a<br/>&gt; moment, I&apos;d use that as a transitional point to take off in a<br/>&gt; completely different direction.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I find that theory is fun to play with, but when I&apos;m writing music<br/>I<br/>&gt; go more by how something sounds than what its theoretical<br/>importance<br/>&gt; is.</p><p>++++++  Thanks. Someone is helping me off-list with theory.<br/>        I think I should learn the simple common stuff first.<br/>        If I even get that far. I see your point though. You<br/>        want to make something uncommon, regardless of theory.</p><p>Nice reply,</p><p>-Stephen</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; --TRISTAN<br/>&gt; (<a href="http://dreamingofeden.smackjeeves.com/">http://dreamingofeden.smackjeeves.com/</a>)<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>stephenszpak &#x3C;stephen_szpak@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/21/2006 5:28:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>TRISTAN</p><p>&gt; On 6/14/06, stephenszpak &lt;stephen_szpak@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;             Also was wondering if rock could exist 100&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt;             of years ago.
