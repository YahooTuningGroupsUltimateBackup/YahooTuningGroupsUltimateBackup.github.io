I&apos;m going to find out more how<br/>the softsynth works with pitch bends, but it makes me more inclined<br/>to try to use native Sibelius for microtonality than before.  I&apos;ll<br/>post more when I have more time and have more of this sorted out...</p><p>best to all of you!</p><p>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
