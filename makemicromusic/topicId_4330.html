Not Even Love is a big piece with a ton of stuff going on.<br/>&gt; There&apos;s lots of the 20-tet guitar and lots of elaborate tuning and<br/>&gt; rhythm collisions, but they&apos;re more the sort of thing that&apos;s better<br/>&gt; analyzed after the fact as opposed to the sort of thing that arises<br/>&gt; from a neat formal (tuning) scheme.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The approach I usually take has little to do with acoustics and even<br/>&gt; less to do with extended tonal or serial practices.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When I walk the woods this time of year I never fail to marvel at the<br/>&gt; way the landscape of leafless trees and their backdrop of heavy<br/>&gt; winter skies move me. What I often try to do is capture something of<br/>&gt; these sorts of densities... ones where hearing or seeing or knowing<br/>&gt; every detail is somewhat irrelevant, but the details themselves are<br/>&gt; not.</p><p>What struck me most was the opening.  It was like raw pain.  That&apos;s where<br/>I drew the analogy to Schoenberg, in his hyper-expressionist pieces.<br/>Perhaps it was a lame analogy.  Though you mentioned Pelleas, and I love<br/>that piece, for similar reasons.</p><p>In any case, there was something there with the juxtaposition of the<br/>simple,  non-gliss-able piano part in the background, and the weeping<br/>expressive guitar solo in the foreground.  There was a too-much-ness about<br/>it that I liked.  Funny, this was the section that seemed the least<br/>&quot;microtonal&quot;, but anyway. .</p></div>
