Without going into the mathematical details, which would be more suitable for the tuning-math list, this seems to be related to negri temperament (if you omit every other step in the chain), which suggests it might be useful to check out tunings with slightly sharp octaves (around 1203 cents).

I first tried 20 because I&apos;m a bit of a<br/>contrarian and it totally ignored12&apos;s major thirds and fifths--not<br/>once, but twice! I also knew that it contained 5, which I was<br/>interested in for its approximations in various world cultures;so i<br/>guess i was hoping for something both &quot;weird&quot; and &quot;exotic&quot; . At first<br/>it was quite a shock, because you really can&apos;t play anything from the<br/>standard repertoire as you can in tunings like 19 and 31 (etc) ,and<br/>it took me quite awhile to learn how to use the tuning and be<br/>comfortable with its many stubborn obstinations and obstinate<br/>stubbornations. But i&apos;m not a one tuning guy at all, and 20 is NOT a<br/>good utilitarian tuning.....but i&apos;m not a utilitarian tuning guy<br/>either So, i guess i wouldn&apos;t want to be stuck with only 20, but i<br/>sure am glad i have it . For me, microtonality is like space<br/>exploration and every tuning, of which there are a vast and never-<br/>ending stock, is like some new planet......a fresh alien vista<br/>calling out to me(and FWIW, 13 and 11, both tunings I&apos;ve used quite a<br/>bit, are quite sweet and pretty if you want them to be).<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Yahya Abdal-Aziz&quot; &lt;yahya@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Sun, 19 Mar 2006 dan stearns wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; should anyone be interested, here are a few rough examples of<br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt; tuning/temperament :<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://zebox.com/danstearns_2/">http://zebox.com/danstearns_2/</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the first example is a little attempt to show that while 20-tone<br/>equal<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament is not a particularly concordant temperament--it has<br/>&gt; &gt; extremely rough maj 3rds or 5ths thereby making it a poor<br/>candidate for<br/>&gt; &gt; orthodox tertian harmony,it can still be used to express tonality<br/>&gt; &gt; without avoiding &quot;pretty&quot; sonorities.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the second example is a quick and dirty bit of funk /rock that<br/>plays<br/>&gt; &gt; off the familiar 1/4th of an octave min 3rd .<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the third example is a solo--note the faux bends that are<br/>&gt; &gt; actually &quot;chromatics&quot; , and the slippery sense of &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; .<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dan,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Very, very cool!

Gets over the G-B discontinuity in transferring<br/>&gt; the same fingering from one string to the next, which<br/>&gt; has always bugged me when playing the guitar - there<br/>&gt; are enough technicalities going on that removing just one<br/>&gt; of them would lead to smoother flow when improvising.<br/>&gt; I think I&apos;m going to have to make myself one ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Regards,<br/>&gt; Yahya<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;jszanto@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/20/2006 8:14:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan,</p><p>Thanks, as always, for your particular take on the universe.</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;I first tried 20 because I&apos;m a bit of a contrarian and it totally ignored12&apos;s major thirds and fifths--not once, but twice! I also knew that it contained 5, which I was interested in for its approximations in various world cultures;so i<br/>&gt;guess i was hoping for something both &quot;weird&quot; and &quot;exotic&quot; . At first it was quite a shock, because you really can&apos;t play anything from the standard repertoire as you can in tunings like 19 and 31 (etc) ,and it took me quite awhile to learn how to use the tuning and be comfortable with its many stubborn obstinations and obstinate stubbornations.</p><p>Ah, yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is why it is so soulful to have Dan around - he has a poetic take not only on words but on tunings and music, and it is good to be reminded, from time to time, that these are communicative, malleable tools, to be used as you will.</p><p>Whatever that means.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
