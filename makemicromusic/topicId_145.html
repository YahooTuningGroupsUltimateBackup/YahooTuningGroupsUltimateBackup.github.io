I have mentioned this before in the context of<br/>&gt; &gt; good non-MOS scales which are MOS-scales with the alteration placed<br/>&gt; &gt; on the &quot;wrong note&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This is all very fascinating to me, and it is something that I have<br/>&gt; wished to ask Paul about, relating to his numerous comments<br/>&gt; about &quot;Coherency&quot; in pitch sets. Perhaps I should ask this on the<br/>&gt; mother list, but since I am currently working on a CD that uses all<br/>&gt; MOS scales, I will take the liberty of asking them here.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Hi Jacky,</p><p>Dan Stearns, Paul and Kraig will probably have some better answers<br/>either cause they&apos;ve made more music or have a better grasp on<br/>the math, but I&apos;ll chime in with what little I can.</p><p>&gt; First I would like to say that there are certain criteria that I look<br/>&gt; for in a MOS scale that seems to make it infinitely more musically<br/>&gt; useful to the current work I&apos;m doing. I already have all of the<br/>&gt; scales designed from this project, and all of them meet this set of<br/>&gt; criteria.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On another note, I have found that many times a 3 step size scale<br/>&gt; (isn&apos;t this what Dan Stearn&apos;s has dubbed &quot;Trivalency&quot;?) can be the<br/>&gt; answer to having these &quot;missing notes&quot; especially as far as melody is<br/>&gt; concerned.</p><p>One of the things I was alluding to in a few posts (on a few lists)<br/>relates to this. When I say &quot;apply the alteration to the wrong note&quot;<br/>what I am saying in shorthand is the following.</p><p>We have some diatonic scale with a bunch of L&apos;s and s&apos;s.</p><p>The &apos;#&apos; is L-s and the &apos;b&apos; is s-L. If the scale is MOS and you apply<br/>it at the right point, it transposes (rotates the order of L and s).</p><p>However, if it is not MOS, or you don&apos;t apply the alteration to the<br/>right point, good things may happen nonetheless. Really obvious<br/>examples are the melodic minor and harmonic minor, neither of which<br/>are MOS, but can be produced by a single alteration of the parent<br/>MOS. [When I speak of scales I use that as a shorthand to include<br/>all rotations, so I&apos;m not slighting any of the modes of the three<br/>scales alluded to].</p><p>Harmonic Minor is also a 3 step size scale, which is one of the<br/>things that happens when you start applying alterations to the<br/>wrong note.</p><p>This gets into a &quot;religious&quot; sort of thing. If you never use<br/>a note in a scale, is it still there?</p><p>For instance, 1 2 b3 #4 5 6 b7 is the fourth mode of harmonic<br/>minor (all alterations are in West-speak, related to a mythical<br/>major scale... ignore tuning for a second (hey, stop hitting)).</p><p>Someone might say, &quot;oh, thats the diminished scale<br/>[1 2 b3 4 #4 5 6 b7] and you never played the fourth degree&quot;. In<br/>this case, its back to being diatonic.</p><p>This happened with the way I looked at one of your three interval<br/>scales on one of these lists. Since the third interval L was<br/>equal to M+s, I just rewrote it as an &quot;imaginary parent diatonic&quot;.</p><p>Of course, if that doesn&apos;t happen (and we can easily come up with<br/>cases  which don&apos;t), then my ability to relate it to MY<br/>understanding of MOSness falls apart. (This is true if we<br/>start adding tuning to the equation and mode above does not<br/>have [in log domain] b3-1 == #4-b3) (Now will you stop hitting?).</p><p>I&apos;m looking forward to the answers to your specific questions.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=149 href="#149">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2001 2:03:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I moved this discussion to the main tuning list.</p></div><h3><a id=151 href="#151">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2001 2:18:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I moved this discussion to the main tuning list.</p></div>
