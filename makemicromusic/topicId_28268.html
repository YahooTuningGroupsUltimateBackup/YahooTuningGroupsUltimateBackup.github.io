The Hammond organ draw bars are<br/>tempered, not tuned pure, and that is a big part of its characteristic<br/>sound, the draws bars [overtones] do not beat with the corresponding other<br/>notes when played together.   This only works because all the tones are<br/>signwaves.</p><p>fg</p><p>On Sat, Oct 22, 2011 at 7:18 AM, clamengh &lt;clamengh@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; **<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Freeman Gilmore&gt; If you had a small organ with few ranks of pipes, one rank<br/>&gt; could be used for<br/>&gt; &gt; more than one thing.

The electric organs I knew about; I was unsure about pipe organs. The 31-tet Fokker organ was mentioned; it&apos;s a very small one, and in case anyone is wondering, it only has 8&apos; and 4&apos; stops, no mutation stop fifths.</p><p>jn</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;clamengh&quot; &lt;clamengh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Freeman Gilmore&gt; If you had a small organ with few ranks of pipes, one rank could be used for<br/>&gt; &gt; more than one thing.
