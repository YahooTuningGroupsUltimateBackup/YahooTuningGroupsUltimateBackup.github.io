Margo&apos;s FM<br/>synthesis uses such a method, yes?  But if I&apos;ve understood you<br/>correctly, you have done the latter; that is, started with a sampled<br/>sound, analyzed and subtracted out the highly pitched portions, leaving<br/>the characteristic unpitched (or poorly pitched) noises that make the<br/>instrument sound &quot;real&quot;, shifted the pitched portions and added them<br/>back in?  The guitar in the 19-tET piece, for example; did that not<br/>start life as an acoustic sample?</p><p>OK, yes, I just went back and read your post,</p><p>   <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/1152">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MakeMicroMusic/message/1152</a></p><p>Reading this makes manipulating the partials of sampled waves sound<br/>almost easy (using Matlab).  Moving things from the time domain into<br/>the frequency domain and back.  And I gather that transients are somehow<br/>preserved (since FFT&apos;s require integrals across time, I&apos;m a little vague<br/>on how this works).</p><p>&gt;Id be happy to share my code, but as I warned before, its in Matlab<br/>&gt;and is absolutely not user friendly.</p><p>Sorry, what does this code do again?  Remap the partials of a wave with<br/>the push of a button?</p><p>My thanks for your help, Bill.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
