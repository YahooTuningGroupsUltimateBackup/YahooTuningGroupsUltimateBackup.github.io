Get a friend to listen, to get<br/>&gt; his/her hands wet in sticky tuning goo, for a moment. Fool a stalwart<br/>&gt; 12tet-thumper into hearing an alternative.</p><p>Well, I&apos;ve been playing my part in this.  I sent the URL for the podcast to some of my online friends, and I&apos;ve been touting my MP3 player around the school and its environs.  In the dinner hall, I played my piece and the start of the podcast to one of the students who&apos;s interested in computers, and his friend.  I played my piece to some of my students before lessons.  I played it to some people in a toy shop.  And I played it to a young lady outside a disreputable establishment where, I hasten to add, I was not involved in the production of sticky goo of a physical nature.</p><p>So far, the feedback has been entirely positive.  Granted, my students are hardly likely to say they don&apos;t like it because I&apos;ll be grading them at the end of term.  But it&apos;s worth noting that nobody&apos;s spotted anything odd about the tuning.  This is fortunate because I don&apos;t know the Chinese for &quot;microtonal&quot; and don&apos;t have any lattices to hand.  The youngsters in the dinner hall, who got as far as big giant worms (which they seemed to like, although they politely requested I leave after it finished ;) asked if something was &quot;American village music&quot;.  That might have been my piece as it came around again, or the whole thing (they paid particular attention to the spoken pieces, which of course are Prent and The Bearded One, so they might have spotted the accents). It&apos;s possible they&apos;re used to hearing different tunings in folk music and only expect pop music to be equally tempered.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;ll keep touting it around, and let you know if I get any interesting comments back.</p><p>             Graham</p></div>
