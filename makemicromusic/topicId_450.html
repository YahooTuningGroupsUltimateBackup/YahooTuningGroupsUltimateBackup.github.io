The piece is about 10 minutes,<br/>but maybe I&apos;ll think of a way to put it up somewhere. For now, I&apos;m<br/>towing the line and trying to hold myself to only non-pitched or<br/>microtonal excerpts. I&apos;m almost out, too!</p><p>&gt; I know you&apos;ve mentioned the fact that your wife is a cellist, do<br/>&gt; you two ever collaborate musically (if you don&apos;t mind me asking)?</p><p>Well, the dear is firmly in the non-adventurous camp, although a high<br/>point of her playing (for me) came last year during some programs of<br/>Messeian&apos;s &quot;Quartet for the End of Time&quot;. I&apos;ve arranged and produced<br/>chamber music for some studio projects that she played on, but mostly<br/>I&apos;m too shy to force my dreck out of her lovely instrument. We will<br/>be performing some newish chamber music next week as part of the La<br/>Jolla Chamber Music Festival&apos;s &quot;SummerFest&quot; programs - Bruce<br/>Adolphe&apos;s &quot;Tyrannisaurus Sue&quot; (for one of their family programs).<br/>It&apos;s harmless but has some nice challenges, and is good new music for<br/>getting young people to not listen like &quot;rollos&quot;.</p><p>Thanks for listening...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
