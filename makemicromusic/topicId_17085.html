He was not one to look back which could be heard in how radically different his earlier 12-tone guitar music sounded<br/>He was a constant explorer, experimenting with different open string tunings, and a great variety of techniques.<br/>constantly changing timbres within his finger picking style.<br/>I don&apos;t think a single day went by when he didn&apos;t play for over an hour or two.<br/>I had just given someone in Berlin his e-mail who was attempting to contact him about playing there.</p><p>David Beardsley wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Kraig Grady wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I am sorry that i have to inform this community that rod poole was<br/>&gt; &gt;stabbed to death last night by 2 gang members he got into an altercation<br/>&gt; &gt;with. this is all i know<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m stunned.
