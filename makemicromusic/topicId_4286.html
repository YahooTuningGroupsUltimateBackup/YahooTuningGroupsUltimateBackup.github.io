I managed to<br/>change the order of the keys so that I now have 22-tone keyboard with<br/>44 keys in Steve Reszutek&apos;s layout. The only thing I needed was a<br/>screwdriver! After removing the keys (which was easy) I reassembled<br/>them in this order:</p><p>C/F, black, C/F, black, G, black, A, Black, B/E, Black, B/E</p><p>This was repeated four times until I ran out of suitable keys. No<br/>filing of the keys was required. I covered the remaining five empty<br/>keyslots with anti-static plastic which came from a plastic bag for<br/>computer components. I&apos;m very satisfied with the result. It looks<br/>pretty decent.</p><p>Bart Willemse, the author of the Balanced Keyboard website, has<br/>promised to build a list of keyboards that can be converted. The<br/>Balanced keyboard is a different concept but the site contains some<br/>useful information for microtonalists.</p><p><a href="http://www.balanced-keyboard.com/">http://www.balanced-keyboard.com/</a></p><p>Kalle</p></div><h3><a id=4294 href="#4294">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E; &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2003 12:34:26 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kalle Aho &lt;kalleaho@m...&gt;&quot;<br/>&lt;kalleaho@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Folks!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to share my keyboard modification experiences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My Roland (Edirol) PC-180A Midi Keyboard Controller had originally<br/>49<br/>&gt; unweighted velocity sensitive keys (no aftertouch).

Specifically, would you use your thumb on<br/>&gt; the first, or your second finger . . . Either way is really hard because<br/>&gt; of the thumb passing to either get onto or off of the short keys from<br/>&gt; the longer ones, and potentially puts one in a position of being unable<br/>&gt; to use the same fingering for a second octave of the same scale pattern.</p><p>So: has anyone actually done any extensive playing on such a balanced<br/>keyboard, and what are your thoughts?</p><p>As for the problem of whether it makes things better for micro-tonal work<br/>or not... At least it makes them balanced!</p><p>I was thinking you could almost devise a slight update to the standard<br/>lines/spaces staff notation and put short keys on lines and long keys on<br/>spaces... For odd number of tones/octave, you end up with each octave<br/>alternating line/space/line/space; but for even tones/octave all octaves<br/>would start on (either) space or line.</p><p>Just some thoughts,<br/>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=4296 href="#4296">ðŸ”—</a>wallyesterpaulrus &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E; &#x3C;wallyesterpaulrus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/21/2003 1:21:54 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Rick McGowan &lt;rick@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I also looked at the web page provided for these keyboard<br/>modifications at:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &#x9;<a href="http://www.balanced-keyboard.com">http://www.balanced-keyboard.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It seemed somewhat interesting to me.
