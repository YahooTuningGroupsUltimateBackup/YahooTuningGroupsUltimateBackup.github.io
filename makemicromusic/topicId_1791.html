Rumba). Furthermore there<br/>are still San (Bushman) people in Namibia which borders on Angola.<br/>Regarding the 7-9-11-13: was this overtone singing? If not it does not<br/>surprise me.</p><p>Some Xhosa music:</p><p>1. &apos;Songs of the Rainbow Nation&apos; (Music Village 101) (** not to be confused<br/>with other CD&apos;s with &apos;Rainbow Nation&apos; in the title).<br/>South Africa is a nation of many cultures, you won&apos;t find a better<br/>representation on any other CD. Includes 3 tracks from the Ngqoko Village<br/>Ensemble who sing above a throat singer.<br/>The sleeve notes read: &quot;One of the Ngqoko Ensamble, Mrs. NoWayilethi<br/>Mbizweni is an expert in the technique, almost unknown in Africa, of<br/>Umngqokolo split-tone or harmonic singing ...... In this technique, the<br/>singer intones a deep, gruff note or drone. She then selects harmonic<br/>partials of this note to resonate in her mouth and throat. thus producing a<br/>melody which is heard as an almost ethereal, whistling sound, high above<br/>the low drone.</p><p>2. The book: &apos;Xhosa Music&apos; by David Dargie (ISBN 0-86486-102-8 Daviid<br/>Philip, Cape Town and Johannesburg). Comes with an excellent cassette.</p><p>3. Madosini: MELT2000: BW108. Madosini plays the traditional mouth bow as<br/>well as the jaw harp, I had the privalige of meeting her last year. More of<br/>this another time.</p><p>Bushman music:</p><p>1.
