I was getting complaints about the<br/>wierd super-short notes.  My plan was to realize it with my new string<br/>patches like I&apos;m using on L&apos;Ecume, but it turned out to be a pain<br/>because of the lack of velocity support on those sample sets.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Really like this version of BlueStrider, which I had only<br/>&gt; heard as a MIDI file.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Steve Layton did that - <a href="http://www.niwo.com">http://www.niwo.com</a> - he&apos;s got some cool piano<br/>music himself at his ampcast site.</p><p>&gt; Love the Espace and Transcension albums!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Spirale d&apos;Arco is fun.

Steve&apos;s my co-moderator for my NetNewMusic so he&apos;s always<br/>putting those quotes in there.  Love that Xenakis quote about death<br/>and the other one about space/time. And also Joe Benzola&apos;s quote about<br/>people being scared of his music.  Cracks me up...</p><p>jeff</p></div>
