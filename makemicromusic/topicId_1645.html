(The latter pays the<br/>bills.) He studied at Univ of Washington &amp; U.C. Berkeley. Semi-amateur<br/>composer of microtonal ballet music (mainly), and some incidental music for<br/>theater productions. See the home page for samples as well as photos,<br/>poetry, prose, and pointers.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=1646 href="#1646">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.

You give hope to a new owner of an old TX-802! Very fun stuff, and I like that there is variety in style and &apos;instrumentation&apos; in addition to being microtonal.</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;So, since about everyone else is listed there...

Yes, I think they&apos;re pretty good boxes. I have three of<br/>them now. They&apos;re pretty easy to program and tune. (I use MidiQuest 8 these<br/>days, but most of my voices were hand-programmed in the old days.) I&apos;ve<br/>recently started using Scala for tuning tables, but years ago I laboriously<br/>entered all of the tunings by hand. In the drawback side, the TX802 front<br/>panel UI for everything leaves something to be desired! Also, I find the<br/>voices tend to be a little thin in the upper partials.</p><p>I&apos;ve been thinking of moving toward software synthesis (with Infinity) but<br/>my machine is too slow...</p><p>&gt; Ah, pointers. That&apos;s when I lost interest in programming in &apos;C&apos;. :)</p><p>Heh... Pointers are the nemesis of many a budding programmer...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=1713 href="#1713">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/12/2002 10:11:46 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey Jacky --</p><p>&gt; Rick - I&apos;m also hugely interested in Infinity - but - and BIG BUT -<br/>&gt; can we affrim that this thing can allow one to design synths which<br/>&gt; have full retuning capabilites???</p><p>Yes, I asked them and early on suggested they add it, which they did, but<br/>not in the very first release. The most recent &quot;service pack&quot; for Infinity<br/>2.0 is supposed to have full keyboard retuning.  Apparently you can give it<br/>a list of note numbers &amp; frequencies, I believe from a file. However, I<br/>have not tried this out. I have Infinity 2.0 here, in a box, awaiting a new<br/>machine... (The package arrived here at a very inopportune time in my<br/>life, and I have never gotten around to installing it...)</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
