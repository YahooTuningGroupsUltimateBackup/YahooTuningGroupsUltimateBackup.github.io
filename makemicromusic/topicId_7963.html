Don&apos;t use MIDI for presentation as the way its<br/>played back will vary with each sound card.  Sometimes<br/>the pitch bend messages don&apos;t work properly and the<br/>harmonics of the instrument voices won&apos;t reproduce the<br/>audible effect as you intended.  For example, one<br/>clarinet voice in Bohlen-Pierce tuning would work<br/>great while another might sound awful for someone<br/>else&apos;s set of default MIDI soundfonts.  If there is a<br/>MIDI file you want to present, render it to WAV with a<br/>program like Timidity++<br/><a href="http://timidity.sourceforge.net/">http://timidity.sourceforge.net/</a> and encode it to OGG.</p><p>2.  Don&apos;t use MP3 (MPEG-2 layer 3) because it is<br/>uselessly bulky compared to the MPEG-4 generation<br/>audio formats.</p><p>3.  Among the MPEG-4/quasi-MPEG-4 generation audio<br/>formats, don&apos;t use proprietary ones because at least<br/>in principle (in terms of licensing), you won&apos;t have<br/>nearly as much freedom of control (either in the<br/>short-term or the long-term) without paying money.<br/>This means not using WMA, RM, AAC(?), etc.</p><p>4.  So, I think OGG <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">http://www.vorbis.com/</a> is the best<br/>lossy format to use.  If you have the webspace, in my<br/>picky opinion, its ideal to make a lossless format<br/>available like FLAC <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/">http://flac.sourceforge.net/</a>.<br/>Since FLAC is streamable, I think that there is no<br/>question that as average user bandwidth increases,<br/>lossless formats like FLAC will become the norm.</p><p>I hope this helps out!</p><p>Shaun</p><p>Just learning, first attempt:</p><p><a href="http://mozartonmars.musicpage.de/">http://mozartonmars.musicpage.de/</a></p><p>--- danieljameswolf &lt;djwolf1@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would like to have asked this question via a<br/>&gt; formal poll, but (a)<br/>&gt; that feature&apos;s been turned off for MMM (and Yahoo<br/>&gt; groups doesn&apos;t allow<br/>&gt; it to be turned on again after a group has been<br/>&gt; established) and (b)<br/>&gt; experience shows that only a handful of members will<br/>&gt; ever respond<br/>&gt; anyways.

Also, the quality of the sounds are very dependent on the MIDI<br/>device -- that I do know.  It may sound great on your super duper sound card at<br/>home, but when it gets played on a $10 sound card that barely knows how to<br/>produce simplistic FM audio fromm MIDI, it will sound very different.</p><p>Personally, I would suggest a compressed audio file like mp3 or ogg vorbis.<br/>You can render your files however you like (and you&apos;ll know their done right)<br/>and when you post them as one of these files, you&apos;re guaranteed that they will<br/>be heard the way it was meant to be heard.  wma is also okay, but to the best<br/>of my knowledge, WMA players only exist for windows platforms.  While this may<br/>not be a big deal to you, there are people who use Macs or use the Linux OS,<br/>and they are tough out of luck to hear your really cool composition.</p><p>Avoid WAV files for online downloading.  Yes, the provide the ultimate bit-for-<br/>bit replica of your music, but they are about 10 times bigger and can take<br/>forever to download.  Most people cannot tell the difference between a good MP3<br/>(or OGG file) and the original WAV.</p><p>My .2 cents worth.</p><p>Jay Rinkel (MMM lurker)</p><p>Quoting danieljameswolf &lt;djwolf1@...&gt;:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello --<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would like to have asked this question via a formal poll, but (a)<br/>&gt; that feature&apos;s been turned off for MMM (and Yahoo groups doesn&apos;t allow<br/>&gt; it to be turned on again after a group has been established) and (b)<br/>&gt; experience shows that only a handful of members will ever respond<br/>&gt; anyways.

When finished maybe one wants to make a definitive version of it.</p><p>For instance if it is a piano piece, the listener might want to play it on the Giga piano to hear what it sounds like, or on their<br/>favourite piano patch whatever it is. Or they might want to try it out on some completely other voice. If it is a clarinet piece,<br/>maybe they have a choice of clarinet voices to try. If it is a Bohlen Pierce piece maybe they have a voice they know works well - or<br/>if 13-et maybe they have voices that works well with 13-et etc.</p><p>I mean - as an option - here is the rendered one - and here is the midi clip for those who want to listen to it that way.</p><p>When rendered to .ogg or .mp3 you can only listen to it in the one way.</p><p>The other thing is that midi format is far more accessible for those still on dial up. A 10 MB mp3 will take me about half an hour<br/>to download here in Oxford  before I can listen to it - or if you try to play it in real time you get bursts of sound every so often<br/>for half an hour until it is downloaded. A midi clip can be played instantly in real time.</p><p>There are some with broadband here in UK, more as time goes on, but it isn&apos;t really that widespread yet. Many others have slower<br/>connections than I have - there are still many here in the UK with connections of 30 K or less in the islands and country regions.<br/>When I&apos;m at my mothers place, if many of the islanders are downloading at once, e.g. at 6 p.m., the connection rate goes down to a<br/>crawl (not sure why but I think it is because they are nearly all connected using the same ISP and there are only a few lines<br/>dedicated to the entire island) and you only get a fast connection late at night or early in the morning where fast means over 30K.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2004 8:11:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;(c) mp3s<br/>&gt;(d) ogg-vorbis<br/>&gt;(a) midi with individual pitch-bend messages<br/>&gt;(b) midi for external re-tuning (e.g. via a relay program like &quot;Midi<br/>&gt;Relay&quot; or &quot;InTun&quot; or to a synth with tuning tables)<br/>&gt;(f) wav<br/>&gt;(e) wma</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/29/2004 9:07:51 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Well, to me it&apos;s fairly obvious that if you&apos;re going to put music on the<br/>web, you want to use the format that the largest number of potential users<br/>can listen to.
