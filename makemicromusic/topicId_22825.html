It is the same situation when you have a timbre that is all the same a volume that is all the same or equally stepped. people find it artificial which is why they &apos;humanize&quot; all these things. i don&apos;t know why scales would be not so inclined also.</p><p>In all my years of playing the mavila i do, i have never heard anyone say it didn&apos;t sound right.</p><p>But the Chopi tuning is closer to this tuning than 12 ET and think if they had been given the choice would have chosen the this.

It sounded to me like a video game soundtrack on</p><p>&gt; something. I feel like I&apos;m playing Sonic the Hedgehog on acid or</p><p>&gt; something.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; But really, this is my first time getting into 7 or 14-equal, and all</p><p>&gt; of the synesthetic colors in my head basically exploded and mixed</p><p>&gt; together, and I liked it. I&apos;ve been using microtonality as a way to</p><p>&gt; get into more accuracy, or more complexity - like 31-tet as a</p><p>&gt; hyperchromatic approach to meantone for example - but from a meantone</p><p>&gt; perspective 7-equal is even more simple, and it&apos;s awesome.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; But I would have used a quantizer or something on some of those chords...</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt; -Mike</p><p>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=23000 href="#23000">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/8/2010 10:22:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Philip K Dick?   -C.</p><p>Rich wrote:</p><p>&gt;Awesome tracks - very PKD<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Rich Duckworth<br/>&gt;Lecturer in Music Technology<br/>&gt;Department of Music<br/>&gt;House 5<br/>&gt;Trinity College<br/>&gt;Dublin 2<br/>&gt;Ireland<br/>&gt;Tel 353 1 896 1500<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;It&apos;s the most devastating moment in a young mans life, when he quite<br/>&gt;reasonably says to himself, &quot;I shall never play The Dane!&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;--- On Wed, 8/9/10, sevishmusic &lt;sevish@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;From: sevishmusic &lt;sevish@...&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: [MMM] Awesome 14-tet piece<br/>&gt;To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;Date: Wednesday, 8 September, 2010, 0:59<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=23011 href="#23011">ðŸ”—</a>richard duckworth &#x3C;richduckworth@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/10/2010 1:34:45 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>It&apos;s what came to mind - specifically the bar scene in Total Recall (We can remember it for you wholesale)</p><p>--- On Wed, 8/9/10, Carl Lumma &lt;<a href="mailto:carl@lumma.org">carl@lumma.org</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>From: Carl Lumma &lt;carl@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Re: [MMM] Awesome 14-tet piece<br/>To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>Date: Wednesday, 8 September, 2010, 18:22</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>      Philip K Dick?   -C.</p><p>Rich wrote:</p><p>&gt;Awesome tracks - very PKD</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;Rich Duckworth</p><p>&gt;Lecturer in Music Technology</p><p>&gt;Department of Music</p><p>&gt;House 5</p><p>&gt;Trinity College</p><p>&gt;Dublin 2</p><p>&gt;Ireland</p><p>&gt;Tel 353 1 896 1500</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s the most devastating moment in a young mans life, when he quite</p><p>&gt;reasonably says to himself, &quot;I shall never play The Dane!&quot;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;--- On Wed, 8/9/10, sevishmusic &lt;sevish@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;From: sevishmusic &lt;sevish@...&gt;</p><p>&gt;Subject: Re: [MMM] Awesome 14-tet piece</p><p>&gt;To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a></p><p>&gt;Date: Wednesday, 8 September, 2010, 0:59</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
