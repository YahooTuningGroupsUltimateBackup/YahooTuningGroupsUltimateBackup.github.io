I enjoy the sound of your instrument. I particularly like the crisp wooden tone. I have made myself a couple of lyres (1 has 6 strings and is electric. I use that at gigs. The other has 7 strings and is acoustic, but needs work to give a better tone) and a 5 string kantele, but I don&apos;t have any recordings yet.</p><p>Link to pictures of electric lyre and kantele:<br/><a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=329079&id=536589255&l=05acffcc71">http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=329079&id=536589255&l=05acffcc71</a></p><p>I have mostly been tuning to 5 limit just intonation because I can do that by ear fairly easily. Occasionally I have tuned with intervals like 8/7 and sometimes got good result, but I haven&apos;t tried that on stage yet. I find it difficult enough tuning to 5 limit JI by ear in a noisy environment. I recently had to tune to 1, 16/15, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5 while someone was playing bagpipes full blast into a microphone right next to me. To make tuning easier, I try to make the instrument isolated from the sounds in the air and use a stethoscope.</p><p>Chris:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m finding pentatonic scales more and more in my work and this is no exception.

I also tried tuning to a 7 note scale devised by Michael (DJ Trance Dance) by playing the notes with Scala and tuning the lyre to them by ear, but that was on the acoustic lyre (because it&apos;s the only one with 7 strings) and I think I need to improve the timbre and make the tuning more stable to properly appreciate the subtleties of that scale (It&apos;s an irregularly tempered Dorian mode with some just intervals. It is devised to minimise the maximum deviation from the pure dyads 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 16/9 and 9/5 whilst keep the octave at exactly 2 and without concern for the size of semitones or major 7ths).</p><p>Chris: &gt; This is *not* a spectacular piece of music - more or less an exercise and follow through on a previous thought I posted.

And - wow - playing hammer<br/>&gt; dulcimer is *alot* harder then I ever imagined.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris<br/>&gt;<br/>Mark: I think that marking the harmonic points is a very good idea. I&apos;ve been tempted to do that on some of my related instruments. Aswell as giving more notes with a different timbre, harmonics can make it easy to accurately tune to just intonation up to a limit of 7 (And higher limit if you have the skill to play higher harmonics).</p><p>Last night I experimented with my seven string lyre, putting more bridges on it and moving the bridges to tune the notes, so that (like a hammered dulcimer), each string gives more than one note. Specifically, I set it up so that each string gives 3 notes: The base note, a note an octave above the base note and a note 2 octaves above the base note.</p><p>I really really like the sound of it. All though it isn&apos;t the way I intended to solve the problem, this gives an instrument with 3 octaves, each with 7 notes in and allows immediate retuning to other 7 note an octave modes simply by retuning the 7 strings. More notes can be added to the octave by adding more strings of the right gauge. Strings can be bent to get notes in between the main notes of the mode. Bending one string raises the pitch of all 3 notes on that string by the same interval.</p><p>I will want to refine the instrument a bit, with more easily adjusted bridges (separate bridge position adjustment for each string like the bridge of an electric guitar) that stay put and add pick ups (3 bridge position Precision Bass Guitar style pickups will do for up to 8 strings. 5 would be enough for 12 notes in an octave).</p><p>Further variations could include positioning the bridges for non octave tunings, using curved bridges to allow the bowing of separate strings, having large tuning levers instead of machine heads so that you can quickly tune to another mode in the middle of a song or instrumental piece and having more than 3 notes on each string.</p><p>This is exactly the kind of instrument where marking harmonic positions would be a really good idea.</p><p>You can also play it with a slide like a cosmo lyre or bow chords, or bow single notes on the highest or lowest string (but not the strings in between because the bridges are flat at the moment). To bow chords I bow all the strings and damp the ones I don&apos;t want to hear. To bow single notes I hold my finger to the string (or hold the string between my fingers) while bowing only that string.</p></div><h3><a id=23715 href="#23715">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/20/2010 11:08:33 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>sorry for the length of this</p><p>The scale is a recurrent sequence so while many intervals are close none quite duplicate.<br/>I actually use a smaller sets of pentatonics than say a &apos;schillinger like math number crunch might give you.<br/>You can actually use these with any 12 tone system.</p><p>The first 19 i use are from those found within these 7 tone scales<br/><a href="http://anaphoria.com/modal12.pdf">http://anaphoria.com/modal12.pdf</a><br/>these are the basic of most your north Indian scales and so i consider them without question<br/>[in the diagrams the underline below a note signifies flattening.]</p><p>now 11 of these are also those formed if you look at the five note left out from the 7.<br/>So this lead me to investigate all the 7 tones scales that are formed from the 19 pentatonics.<br/>and so i west to investigate all the pentatonic available in this set of 19 heptatonics.<br/>No only one more pentatonic was possible so i included that .<br/>at this point i ended up with a closed set.</p><p>So each of these 20 has 5 notes , each could be the tonic so even in 12 ET one could get 100 pentatonics.<br/>Now if each of these will sound different on a different step of a scale that has unequal size steps you get 1200.<br/>The 20th group though is a simple whole tone of only 5 instead of 6 tones so you can see these would be duplicated.</p><p>Now i only used the L ssls pattern in the 7 tone scales.<br/>i have figured out the s s s sl pentatonic buy haven&apos;t used them.<br/>i have noticed that certain South Indian Heptatonics are the Reciprocal of some of these.<br/>But i haven&apos;t exhausted the first set yet as far as exploring modulations in between.<br/>often restricting to how one pentatonic goes to another with a heptatonic. depending on which heptatonic one has one often has many option of where one can modulate to with what i think more of a a organic set over a mathematical set.</p><p>/^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_ //^/Kraig Grady_^_,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,_<br/>Mesotonal Music from:<br/>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_ ^North/Western Hemisphere:<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>_&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;_^South/Eastern Hemisphere:<br/>Austronesian Outpost of Anaphoria &lt;<a href="http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/">http://anaphoriasouth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</p><p>&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,&apos;,</p><p>a momentary antenna as i turn to water<br/>this evaporates - an island once again</p><p>On 20/11/10 10:09 AM, Chris Vaisvil wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for the listen and comment.

This was quite helpful!!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Now - modulation - in common harmonic practice modulation &gt; usually enlists a<br/>&gt; pivot of some type - something that is the same but with &gt; different meanings<br/>&gt;
