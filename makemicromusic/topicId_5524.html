You have to pre-think anything you write in code, and how easy is it for me to think as a midi-gear? I wish you much success for the first release! You&apos;ll probably send a mail to MMM to let us know :)</p><p>All the best,<br/>Clemens<br/>  From: monz<br/>  To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>  Sent: Wednesday, October 01, 2003 9:39 PM<br/>  Subject: [MMM] Re: Microtonal Sequencer?</p><p>  hello Clemens,</p><p>  --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Clemens&quot; &lt;ontheway1@g...&gt;<br/>  wrote:<br/>  &gt; Hello all!<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; I tried to find a Microtonal Sequencer in the web. I know<br/>  &gt; about Scala and FTS, but is there a software that supports<br/>  &gt; scale editing ~while~ composing - via a sequencer? I miss<br/>  &gt; things like &quot;free scale making&quot;, out of notes I can sing in<br/>  &gt; via microphone, and also a tool structuring one scale into<br/>  &gt; chord or arpeggio sections to make the overview easier,<br/>  &gt; what notes of a larger scale i want to use together.<br/>  &gt; Considering all the people busy with microtonal music,<br/>  &gt; why did noone invent such a thing? Do you think it is<br/>  &gt; useful at all? Or are you happy and satisfied working with<br/>  &gt; the tuning tables of your instruments (assuming we talk<br/>  &gt; about midified instruments)?<br/>  &gt; Such a sequencer could also built in Keyboard retuning and<br/>  &gt; an audiofile pitch section. With the solutions I have now,<br/>  &gt; I have to multitask between little tools, interconnecting<br/>  &gt; what could be organized in the hands of one program with<br/>  &gt; much more effort.<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Does anyone at least ~plan~ the development of this kind of<br/>  &gt; tool, or is there a real silence in the need for and creation<br/>  &gt; of a microtonal sequencer? What kind of Sequencers are best<br/>  &gt; for working microtonally?<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Thank you :)<br/>  &gt;<br/>  &gt; Clemens</p><p>  i was more-or-less (mostly less) working on this project<br/>  from 1984 until last year.  but since this past February<br/>  development has been seriously under way.  the projected<br/>  release date for version 1.0 is February 2004.  the tuning<br/>  part is essentially complete now, and the next step is<br/>  to incorporate the sequencer stuff.</p><p>  -monz</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
