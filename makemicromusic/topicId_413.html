I<br/>thought<br/>&gt; that everyone who might have been interested must have downloaded<br/>&gt; them. They took up about 5 megs of space, and I didn&apos;t feel that I<br/>&gt; should take up that much space for long.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I uploaded them again so that Joseph and others who may have missed<br/>&gt; them can check them out if they like.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Thanks, Jacky... these were great... very contemporary with<br/>the &quot;recognizable&quot; Ligon sound... and PANNING.  (Wouldn&apos;t pan the<br/>panning, that&apos;s for sure :) )</p><p>When I first started with electronic music I *only* used sounds that<br/>I created myself... better get back to that soon.</p><p>Thanks for the valuable &quot;tutorials&quot; on music in the studio...</p><p>________ __________ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=455 href="#455">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>8/8/2001 1:31:00 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jacky wrote:</p><p>&gt; Let me know when you&apos;ve got them and I&apos;ll delete them out, because I<br/>&gt; know our policy is to have them in folders.</p><p>Leave them there at least until Friday, because I&apos;ve got most of the week<br/>off work.</p><p>                        Graham</p></div>
