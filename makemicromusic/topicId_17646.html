It uses a voltage control<br/>model of modular synth design so that audio components such as oscillators<br/>and filters can be strung together with virtual &apos;patch cords&apos; and saved as<br/>VST instruments. I&apos;ve developed a microtuner object for this model that<br/>browses and loads Scala files for real-time polyphonic tuning.</p><p>The most notable feature of the microtuner is that it implements<br/>real-time, ensemble scale and key change that can be &apos;played&apos; by midi<br/>note events, where key structures are themselves defined by Scala<br/>files.  If you&apos;re interested to learn more about it, I&apos;ve set up a web page<br/>for the microtuner at <a href="http://www.12equalboresme.com">http://www.12equalboresme.com</a></p><p>Testers with SynthEdit experience would be ideal, but I also have a test<br/>microtonal VST synth, and I&apos;d like to get some idea about its<br/>performance with various host and operating system combinations. The<br/>only prerequisites are a reasonably up-to-date XP or Vista operating<br/>system and a VST host such as Cubase or Sonar.</p><p>If you would be interested in trying it out sometime over the course of<br/>the next two or three weeks, please email me at robert@...</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert Strauss</p></div>
