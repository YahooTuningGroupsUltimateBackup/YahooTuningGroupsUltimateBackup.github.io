Wonderful work!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wow - the Giga-timbres just rule! They completely put the GM sound<br/>&gt; set to shame. ***Great*** sounding strings! And *very* realistic<br/>&gt; sounding.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I like 17 ET. There&apos;s some great &quot;MOS models&quot; in that one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Keep up the great work!</p><p>Will do :-)</p><p>Yes I like 17-et too - grows on you doesn&apos;t it. I find it rather<br/>endearing and tender at times, as you hear in the second 17-et improvisation.</p><p>Now, if one were to hear a complete note on the strings all the<br/>way to the end of the note in the wave sample, then it would be<br/>completely a real note as that is what it is, - if also<br/>played back at the same volume as the recording.</p><p>Even though it isn&apos;t like that most of the time, the<br/>variation in how the notes are played makes it sound very<br/>realistic, because all the notes and all the volume levels for<br/>each one are recorded individually, with those small nuances<br/>of timbre one only gets with a real insrument.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
