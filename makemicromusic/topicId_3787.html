OK, we have seen your announcements previously; I don&apos;t know how many others took a walk over to your mp3 site, but I listened to most of the pieces.</p><p>I have a suggestion: for future postings, instead of just &apos;advertising&apos; the site and the music in general, why don&apos;t you pick one or two pieces and share with us -</p><p>- the scale/intonation/tuning you used<br/>- the way the piece was put together (structure/improvisation/collaboration)<br/>- tools used in the composition/performance of the piece<br/>- programmatic content behind the pieces (if any)</p><p>One thing I noted was repeated &quot;credits&quot; for Harry Partch. Having worked with Partch and his music, other than having him as an inspiration I must confess that I couldn&apos;t hear any Partch influences in the pieces. Maybe you could talk a little about that, too.</p><p>So, since we like to make microtonal music around here, how about sharing a little more than links and titles? :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
