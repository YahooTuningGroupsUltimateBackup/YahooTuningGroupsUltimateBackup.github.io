Macs running OS X,<br/>&gt;&gt; especially new fast machines with OS X v10.3.x run more applications<br/>&gt;&gt; than *any* other computing platform on this planet.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah... Because it&apos;s now Unix? ;-) Anyway, I don&apos;t want to get into an<br/>&gt; argument here about software availability. Your mileage may vary; my<br/>&gt; experience may differ from yours.</p><p>No need for an argument Rick :-) it&apos;s true ;-) For example, an enormous number of command-line *nix apps are just a &apos;./configure&apos;, &apos;make&apos;, &apos;make install&apos; away. As for GUI *nix apps, more and more of those will be accessible too since OS X 10.3.x includes X-windows.</p><p>Real-time audio &amp; MIDI applications are a different matter as it requires platform specific code. But there are already thousands of native applications for OS X.</p><p>Also, if one *could* (but why ? why ?? why ???) run Windows XP within Virtual PC on a Mac.</p><p>So, you can simultaneously (and interactively) run apps in (at least) 3 different environments.</p><p>&gt; As long as we&apos;re talking environments... What makes audiounits superior &gt; to<br/>&gt; VST? Can someone provide a brief synopsis of features?</p><p>I&apos;ve seen it mentioned in several places, but don&apos;t have a proper reference at hand. Anyway, it seems that it may be that AudioUnits run at the OS level, while VST runs at the application level. i.e., it&apos;s part of Apple&apos;s Core Audio API, which is part of OS X.<br/><a href="http://developer.apple.com/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/GS_MusicAudio/index">http://developer.apple.com/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/GS_MusicAudio/index</a>.<br/>html</p><p>Anyway, on the more complicated side of things, SuperCollider is now open source and runs natively on OS X - there is pre-built application, or you can compile it yourself on your own machine from the source code.<br/><a href="http://www.audiosynth.com/">http://www.audiosynth.com/</a></p><p>Another resource to find thousands of audio/midi &amp; other OS X apps :<br/><a href="http://osx.hyperjeff.net/Apps/">http://osx.hyperjeff.net/Apps/</a></p><p>- Joel</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2004 12:15:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Also, if one *could* (but why ? why ?? why ???) run Windows XP within<br/>&gt;Virtual PC on a Mac.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So, you can simultaneously (and interactively) run apps in (at least)<br/>&gt;3 different environments.</p><p>Must... not... reply....

But it would be reallllly nice if we can keep our posts in that light, and avoid platform/OS wars. I think there are very, very few people on these lists that don&apos;t have a reason for using a particular setup, and let&apos;s not waste our precious time trying to convince someone to do or use something else.</p><p>Unless they ask, of course.</p><p>Yours truly,<br/>ListMom</p></div><h3>2357111317 &#x3C;spigot@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2004 1:31:09 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>for what it&apos;s worth (not much, probably!), i play with non-standard tunings<br/>on mac os x in two ways..  it took me a bit of time to work it out after<br/>moving from os 8 and/or a winbox with win2k.. and i have only just scratched<br/>the surface in the hour or two per month of time i find these days for music<br/>making (..sigh).</p><p>but anyway, the quick and dirty, free and slow way i have<br/>is to write up the music in scala&apos;s &quot;seq&quot; format, use scala (ScalaX for os x,<br/>thanks manuel!) to convert to a midi file, and then play that via whatever<br/>midi player is handy (originally a freeware player called mighty midi, more<br/>recently via protools/mbox) either to external synths or to the semi-painful<br/>built-in quicktime synth.</p><p>the more sophisticated, technicality annoying, non-free way i have been<br/>exploring is to build my own synths/samplers/whatever in max-msp, turn them<br/>into protools RTAS plugins with pluggo (all that now in os x, thanks cycling74!<br/>pluggo can make other types of plugins too, incl, i think, VST) -- and then<br/>playing the plugin synth from within protools either by mouse entering midi<br/>notes or just playing on a keyboard and sending the data to the plugin.<br/>of course, experimentation can be done completely within max-msp with much<br/>less technical irritation.. and i do that.. but protools seems a much better<br/>place (for me) to do the dirty work of multi-track mixing and finalizing.</p><p>the second way is far more rewarding, once the technicalities are set up and<br/>i&apos;ve made the plugins the way i want (which is never, it turns out -- they are<br/>always not quite what i want).  the first way is nice in that scala&apos;s .seq<br/>format seems a quick and easy way to try out ideas in whatever random tuning<br/>the day calls for.</p><p>i&apos;ve also explored the max-msp object maker for alternate tunings (mtof) that comes<br/>with.. um.. magic microtuner i think (it&apos;s been a while)...</p><p>anyway, i just thought i&apos;d write up some osx methods i&apos;ve been exploring --<br/>would be curious to hear of others..  one of these days, i will get back to<br/>music making more deeply, really!  if only i could ditch this &quot;job&quot; thing.. :)</p><p>pfly</p><p>(i can&apos;t recall what music i last posted here.  there are a couple hexany<br/>tests i made but they seem to not be online at the moment.  in boring old<br/>12-TET there are a few oddities of late:<br/><a href="http://www.pfly.net/misc/mp3/pfly.GeArpeMooge.mp3">www.pfly.net/misc/mp3/pfly.GeArpeMooge.mp3</a>  -- a snippet from Grosse Fugue<br/>  on wet analogy synths, made one night to annoy a friend<br/><a href="http://www.neuron.net/~pfly/ear/mp3s/bachair-fyehmyx.mp3">www.neuron.net/~pfly/ear/mp3s/bachair-fyehmyx.mp3</a>  -- a weird orchestration<br/>  and meter-skew of bach&apos;s famous &quot;air&quot;.  someday all this chaos will be<br/>  organized and well-presented on <a href="http://pfly.net">pfly.net</a>... but, i seem to keep finding myself<br/>  at this job thing all day!)</p></div><h3>Manuel Op de Coul &#x3C;manuel.op.de.coul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2004 3:06:08 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I can mention that porting of the GUI-version of<br/>Scala to Mac OS X is making good progress now.<br/>Still cannot say when it will be released but hopefully<br/>not a really long time anymore.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Manuel</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>4/16/2004 10:01:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, 2357111317 &lt;spigot@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; but anyway, the quick and dirty, free and slow way i have<br/>&gt; is to write up the music in scala&apos;s &quot;seq&quot; format, use scala (ScalaX<br/>for os x,<br/>&gt; thanks manuel!) to convert to a midi file, and then play that via<br/>whatever<br/>&gt; midi player is handy (originally a freeware player called mighty<br/>midi, more<br/>&gt; recently via protools/mbox) either to external synths or to the<br/>semi-painful<br/>&gt; built-in quicktime synth.</p><p>Sounds familiar.
