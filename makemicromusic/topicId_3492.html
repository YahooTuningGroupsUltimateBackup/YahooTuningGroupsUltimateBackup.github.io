What&apos;s the pattern?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Based on what you said, I first thought it must be: &quot;2 up,<br/>&gt; then 1 down&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C,G, F, D,A, Bb, E,B, Eb, F#,C#, Ab  [12]<br/>&gt; C,G, F, D,A, Bb, E,B, Eb, F#,C#, Ab, G#,D#, Db, A#,E#, Gb, B#<br/>&gt; [19]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But that gives two sharps and three flats.<br/>&gt; Then thought the pattern might be &quot;3 up, 1 down&quot;:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; C,G,D; F; A,E,B; Bb; F#,C#,G#; Eb; [12]<br/>&gt; C,G,D; F; A,E,B; Bb; F#,C#,G#; Eb; D#,A#,E#; Ab; B#,FX,CX [19]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Which does it, but that sure seems lopsided for a default 12<br/>&gt; note meantone keyboard tuning.</p><p>the &quot;pattern&quot; is usually &quot;1 up, 1 down&quot; starting from D as *center*:</p><p>D; A; G; E; C; B; F; F#; Bb; C#; Eb; G# [12]<br/>D; A; G; E; C; B; F; F#; Bb; C#; Eb; G#; Ab; D#; Db; A#; Gb; E#; Cb<br/>[19]</p><p>&gt; Q2. Was C really considered the center of this default three<br/>&gt; sharp two flat meantone tuning?</p><p>not the center -- however, when specifying a 12-tone tuning, it is<br/>*extremely* customary to go from C to c.</p><p>&gt; Was the default selection of sharps and flats pretty much what<br/>&gt; to always expect</p><p>no; in some places and times Ab was &quot;default&quot; rather than G#.</p><p>&gt; or would a performer shift the C# to Dd on<br/>&gt; occasion?</p><p>if you didn&apos;t have split keys, retuning your keyboard for the piece<br/>was expected from most performers in the renaissance era -- in the<br/>baroque and classical eras some regions adopted well-temperaments and<br/>so didn&apos;t have to go through this process.</p><p>&gt; If so, how often? And how often to go further and<br/>&gt; tweak the F# to Gb? Would it ever go further?
