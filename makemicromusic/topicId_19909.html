But one could easily make the volume depend on where you click on the key e.g. towards the top of the key for quieter notes and towards the bottom for louder notes (FTS&apos;s virtual keyboards already have that as an option).</p><p>Robert</p><p><a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/music.htm">http://www.robertinventor.com/software/tunesmithy/music.htm</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
