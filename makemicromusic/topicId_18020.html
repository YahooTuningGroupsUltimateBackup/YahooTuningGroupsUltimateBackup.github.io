I find 31 just gorgeous, and<br/>I don&apos;t have the same problem with the fifth that others do, or even<br/>the ninth. I can definately live with it for the relatively fewer # of<br/>tones, and the delicious 5 and 7 limit.

So<br/>I couldn&apos;t be happy without the meantone ideal, where there are<br/>more-or-less equal diatonic step sizes (sorry, Kraig!)</p><p>I go back and forth on this, though. 17 and ilk are fun for just being<br/>wack. And things like 3and7 based scales (Michael Harrison stuff) are<br/>just fun. I have to admit, I don&apos;t find myself all that attracted to<br/>things beyond the 7- limit that I feel that I *must* have them to say<br/>what I want to say.</p><p>-A.</p></div><h3>Magnus Jonsson &#x3C;magnus@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2007 12:37:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On Fri, 2 Nov 2007, Carl Lumma wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hans Straub wrote...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; it keeps sounding<br/>&gt;&gt; slightly out of tune to me - that large semitone...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1/4-comma sounds more natural, yes, but I&apos;ve always thought 1/3-comma<br/>&gt; is a nice color.</p><p>I agree with both of you :)</p><p>19-edo semitone (126 cents) is right between  16/15 (112 cents) and 13/12 (138 cents), so it has both 5-limit feel and quartertone feel. In fact<br/>C-F# (568 cents) is closer to 11/8 (551 cents) than to 45/32 (590 cents), so you may well hear a semitone as a 11/12 step harmonically. For example, in the key of C, B may be heard as the 11/8 above F, the subdominant. If you want an 11-limit kind of sound then 19-edo is great for its compactness. But I don&apos;t usually want 11-limit sound so I usually prefer a milder temperament between around 2/7 commas and 1/6 commas.</p></div><h3>Carl Lumma &#x3C;carl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/2/2007 8:35:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;One thing about 19 is that it&apos;s more practical.</p><p>Ja.</p><p>&gt;But I&apos;m getting tired of it, and find I&apos;m more attracted to 31 and 53<br/>&gt;these days.

A few years ago I<br/>happened to notice that the intervals in the best major triads beat<br/>at approximately the same rate, so I altered the size of the fifth<br/>slightly in order to make them exactly the same.</p><p>One great advantage of a 19-tone well temperament over the equal<br/>division is a significant improvement in the 7ths (both minor and<br/>major, but particularly the harmonic 7th).  Because 19-ET represents<br/>both 6:7 and 7:8 with a single interval of 4deg, that interval tends<br/>to sound ambiguous: is it a small 3rd or a large 2nd?  The well<br/>temperament remedies that problem such that, e.g., G-A# sounds like a<br/>small 3rd (~6:7), A#-C sounds like a large 2nd (~7:8), and Ab-B<br/>sounds ambiguous (~13:15), just as you&apos;d want them to sound as<br/>members of a harmonic series built on C.</p><p>&gt; I can verify in my spreadsheet that the major triads beat equally<br/>with<br/>&gt; the fifth size given, but I&apos;m interested in more of the theory<br/>behind<br/>&gt; how meta-meantone was developed by Wilson as well, apparantly from a<br/>&gt; limiting process of rationals...I couldn&apos;t really make sense of<br/>what I<br/>&gt; saw in Kraig Grady&apos;s &apos;Wilson archives&apos;....can anyone give a math<br/>summary?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -A.</p><p>While I can&apos;t speak for Erv, I _can_ give my own reasons for why I<br/>find this tuning so attractive.  In 1/4- or 1/3-comma meantone (and<br/>also 31-ET and 19-ET) the rather quick beating of the minor or major<br/>3rds (respectively) make the sound less restful than we would like.<br/>In meta-meantone both 3rds beat much more slowly, and the lack of<br/>rapid beating tends to make an instrument sound more like<br/>it&apos;s &quot;singing.&quot;  (Much the same could be said for 34-ET, BTW.)</p><p>So I guess you could say that the rationale behind meta-meantone is<br/>to minimize the fastest beat rate in a major triad, where the major<br/>3rd is arrived at via a chain of four 5ths.</p><p>Best,</p><p>--George</p></div>
