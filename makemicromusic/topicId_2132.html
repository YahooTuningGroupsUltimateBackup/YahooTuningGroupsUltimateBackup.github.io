(It&apos;s a poor, poor,<br/>poor-man&apos;s version of &apos;2001&apos;.) In one scene, one of the ship&apos;s crew plays an<br/>instrument made of jars and tins. The sound-track is obviously a syntheser<br/>simulating the instrument while the actor mimes, but the piece of music is<br/>quite microtonal sounding and well composed. Does anybody know who composed and<br/>performed it.</p><p>DARREN McDOUGALL</p></div>
