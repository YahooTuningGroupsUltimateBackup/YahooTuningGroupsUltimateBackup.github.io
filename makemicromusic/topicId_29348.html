Can you share how you used your pair ?</p><p>Sure... I bought my first TX802 brand new in Tokyo, in 1988. I had heard it was micro-tunable, and I was getting into that, so the TX802 was perfect. I subscribed to the Computer Music Journal then, and read the famous article by Wendy Carlos (&quot;Tuning: At the Crossroads&quot;). I did some work with tuning design, etc.</p><p>So I started using the TX802 for microtnal work, like having a chamber orchestra, in the studio. In 1990 I bought another TX802 and started working with larger ensembles up to 16 parts. I liked working in 15-equal, but did some work in harmonic tunings, Carlos &quot;alpha&quot;, 17-equal, Balinese tunings, and others. At one time I had 3 TX802s that I sometimes used together.</p><p>Before 1992, I used a rustic program called Concertware on a 512k Mac, then Finale on Windows starting in 1998.</p><p>I stopped using the TX802s much after 2003, once my computer was fast enough for VST soft synths like Big Tick&apos;s &quot;Rhino&quot;. But I haven&apos;t really written any new music since 2009...</p><p>So the TX802s need a good home! :-) Someone interested in vintage instruments, I guess.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>    Rick</p></div><h3><a id=29351 href="#29351">ðŸ”—</a>Daniel Forr&#xF3; &#x3C;danforcz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/19/2014 4:06:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>So is it 100 Volt Japanese model?</p><p>If you would consider returning it to Japan, I could be interested in one of them :-) I have one which needs a friend.</p><p>Two TX802 can be used also for doubling polyphony - one can play all odd notes, another one all even notes...</p><p>This instrument is good for microtonal music as each of 8 parts can have different tuning. Besides preset tunings there are two custom tunings and another 63 could be saved on the RAM4 cartridge.</p><p>Just the sounds it produces are limited from contemporary point of view, it&apos;s 6OP Yamaha algorithm synthesis combining Phase Modulation and additive principle. Good for electronic sounds, not so usable for imitative sounds when we have all those sample based and physical modeling machines nowadays.</p><p>Is that Wendy&apos;s article available somewhere on the internet?</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 20 Oct, 2014, at 4:13 AM, Rick McGowan rick@...
