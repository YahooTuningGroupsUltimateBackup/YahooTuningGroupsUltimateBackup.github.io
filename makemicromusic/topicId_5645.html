Although<br/>&gt; when i was work exclusively in such animals i would tune up two hexanies<br/>&gt; opposite each other in the eikosany, The bewst of these (from memory) were<br/>&gt; hexanies like 5-7-9-11 because they are seperated by a 1-3 (things in the<br/>&gt; eikosany so often work that way). there is also the 1-5-7-11 hexany<br/>&gt; seperated by a 3-9 and being a big fan of the 1-3-7-9-11-15 eikosany (since<br/>&gt; it falls into a 22 tone scale so easily you have the 1-7-11-15 hexanies a<br/>&gt; 3-9 apart.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; although for the most part i would use my centaur tuning<br/>&gt; <a href="http://anaphoria.com/centaur.html">http://anaphoria.com/centaur.html</a></p><p>Hi Kraig,</p><p>Yes...I&apos;ve used Centaur more than once--nice tuning, and has also some useable<br/>tempered sounding triads to boot (like the A major triad).</p><p>When I want to get more non-western, I like what you&apos;ve done with the CPS<br/>scales....for instance what did you use for that spacious beat-filled<br/>textural drone-like mp3 sample from your new album?</p><p>By &apos;tuning hexanies opposite&apos; I assume you mean 1-3-5-7, and 1-1/3-1/5-1/7 and<br/>octave normalized, no?</p><p>And by &apos;seperated by 1-3&apos; you mean &apos;a perfect fifth apart&apos;, correct?</p><p>I&apos;m finding myself attracted to active, beating textures that I coud use to<br/>slowly morph--you know, drone like things. Harmonics 12 thru 24 works, but I<br/>want to keep exploring other options for the standard keyboard before giving<br/>up and building stuff....</p><p>Best,<br/>Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=5657 href="#5657">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;perlich@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/30/2003 12:42:34 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Aaron K.
