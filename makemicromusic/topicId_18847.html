One of the things I&apos;ve gotten used to<br/>is that when people become engrossed in a conversation, they start<br/>following their muses pretty strongly. It isn&apos;t hard, at all, to have<br/>a thread drift, and especially when people reply with relevant<br/>information that tends to branch, things happen.</p><p>What I *do* notice is an influx of new posters.

What is not a *good* thing is the concept that MMM is just<br/>another tuning list, and if you don&apos;t like the original tuning list<br/>you just simply post here.</p><p>It has always been pretty clear that theoretical topics need to be<br/>closely tied to the creation of new (or the performance of existing)<br/>microtonal music(s). To the extent that it varies from this concept is<br/>the degree to which it is at fault. MMM has always been an<br/>unmoderated-to-lightly-moderated list, and I&apos;d like to see that<br/>continue. That said, it is up to the individual members to<br/>self-regulate their urges to wax poetically on the meaning of the<br/>universe, etc. Maybe an occasional reminder about this, from the<br/>powers that be (such as they are), wouldn&apos;t be remiss.</p><p>I was pleased to see the Blue author chiming in.
