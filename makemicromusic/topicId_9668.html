But at the same time I&apos;ve ended up getting a rather shocking number of CDs, not to mention the music that has been posted on MMM over the last few weeks, that I simply haven&apos;t had the &apos;quiet time&apos; to give a good listening to. Certainly Johnny Reinhard&apos;s 3 cds need first attention, other mystery recordings, along with postings from AKJ, Margo, Dan, and others. Just didn&apos;t want any of you to think I wasn&apos;t interested in your music.</p><p>I&apos;ve got some spots carved out. I&apos;ll be listening, and trying to do a little writing/playing too. Back soon.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
