My one quibble was with this last part:</p><p>&gt;I&apos;d hope here at MMM that unless the realisation gets _completely_ in the &gt;way of hearing the tuning being demonstrated,  the discussion would stay &gt;focused on the tuning, and suggestions for improving the realisation can &gt;take a back channel.</p><p>I&apos;d suggest that if the only thing of importance in discussing was *tuning*, it should go to the tuning list. MMM was intended as a more holistic experience, and there really are people who *need* to find out how to make their microtonal music work better. This may mean how to make a notation program spit out microtones, or how to render (well) a midi file with pitch bends and soundfonts, or what synthesis method or box or app might best suit a particular style or approach to microtonality. And etc.</p><p>I&apos;ve always fought hard to support those who would seek live performances on acoustic resources (my good friend Alison leaps to mind), but there are many ways to approach the formation of one&apos;s idea of microtonality, and unless it egregiously veers away from music into sheer techy dweebiness, it would be great to allow those discussions to flourish when needed.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p><p>P.S. I hadn&apos;t ever thought of it before, but couldn&apos;t you get a nice side career going in the dance clubs in Hungary as DJ Wolf? :)</p></div>
