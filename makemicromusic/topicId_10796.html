They did a marvelous job on both...the action is easy to play, and the intonation is exceptional...both axes stay in tune extremely well. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to have them do another one if I need it done...HHH</p></div><h3>David Beardsley &#x3C;db@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/2005 9:29:19 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Neil Haverstick wrote:</p><p>&gt;   Both my 34 tone electric guitar and bass have new refretted necks by &gt;Carruthers, which the late Larry Hanson had done sometime in the early &gt;1990&apos;s, I believe.
