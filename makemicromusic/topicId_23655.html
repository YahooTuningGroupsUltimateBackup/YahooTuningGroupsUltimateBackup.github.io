&gt; In a temperment, one goes from one &apos;out of tune&apos; chord to &gt; another.<br/>&gt; &gt; i think if one is going to use JI one need not restrict oneself<br/>&gt; &gt; to such strict practices.<br/>&gt; &gt; This is not to say that each movement will not have it own<br/>&gt; &gt; character, but even some of the more unorthodox has musical use<br/>&gt; &gt; and expression.<br/>&gt; &gt; painting had it s period where only certain colors could be used<br/>&gt; &gt; in combination.<br/>&gt; &gt; We are long past that and can&apos;t concern ourselves with imposing<br/>&gt; &gt; such stifling limitations.<br/>&gt; &gt; If we can accept 7,11,13 ETs there is nothing here we can&apos;t and<br/>&gt; &gt; should not explore.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Well I think one can do whatever one like in rational &gt; intonation, or in a<br/>&gt; temperament.<br/>&gt; But this doesn&apos;t deserve the name Just intonation.<br/>&gt; Not all rational chord progressions sound correct to the ear / &gt; brain, nor<br/>&gt; make sense upon close inspection.<br/>&gt; Furthermore, I belief that Just intonation will reveal a &gt; universal theory of<br/>&gt; harmony. &quot;Do whatever you like rational intonation&quot; offers no &gt; such thing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; -Marcel<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=23689 href="#23689">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/12/2010 5:49:24 PM</span><button style="float: right;

But as I see it, &quot;functional&quot; music is sort of strict and rule-bound, and plays with predictability and expectation, whereas &quot;textural&quot; music is more concerned with &quot;pure sound&quot; and mood.  It&apos;s kind of like the distinction between &quot;realism&quot; and &quot;impressionism&quot; in the visual realm, if that makes any sense.</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Chris Vaisvil &lt;chrisvaisvil@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thank you for the listen and comment!
