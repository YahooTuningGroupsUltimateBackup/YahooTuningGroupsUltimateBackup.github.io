I just got an email from a<br/>British television show that is interested in doing a segment on<br/>unusual instruments. I will probably be having a telephone conversation<br/>with one of the researchers. I think I&apos;m being consulted because of my<br/>blog on ancient instruments. &lt;<a href="http://lutesandviols.blogspot.com/">http://lutesandviols.blogspot.com/</a>&gt; I<br/>have a lot of ideas, but I would like to also mention some unusual<br/>instruments that are specifically designed for microtonal music. If you<br/>can provide some examples or links, it would be appreciated.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if this will amount to anything. I know someone else who<br/>assisted with a similar type of research and his information was pretty<br/>much ignored in the end. It seems like it might be fun to collect this<br/>information anyways.</p><p>Thanks,<br/>Daniel Thompson</p></div>
