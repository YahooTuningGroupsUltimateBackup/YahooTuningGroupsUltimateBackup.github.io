ADS(F)R envelopes? Why is it that so many of<br/>these synths still have such &quot;primitive&quot; envelope generators? These days<br/>it seems like there shouldn&apos;t be any excuse for NOT having a completely<br/>flexible drawable envelope generation!</p><p>Putting in another plug here also for Big Tick&apos;s &quot;Rhino&quot; beta... It also<br/>uses the Scala TUN format, and has a really nice envelope interface. When<br/>this synth is finished, I think it will be a definite rival for synths like<br/>the Native Instruments &quot;Absynth&quot; and similar models. It&apos;s one worth<br/>watching.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
