Currently, my plan is to have built a 31edo classical<br/>guitar.  The big question for me is, who to do the fretwork?</p><p>I contacted pavan guitars ( <a href="http://pavanguitars.com">pavanguitars.com</a> ) and Tom Prisloe said he<br/>can have a Spanish shop guitar constructed for me sans frets, which is<br/>nice because they&apos;re well priced instruments, and the reviews are<br/>good.  For whatever reason, the idea of ripping frets out of a good<br/>guitar bugs me a little bit, and I want a beautiful, no-filler<br/>fretboard, because I&apos;m silly and superficial like that.</p><p>And so that leaves me with the question of who to do the refretting.<br/>Price is somewhat of an issue here, but I&apos;m also willing to pay to get<br/>it do accurately.  A local contact who has confirmed their ability to<br/>do this is Ralph Novax (of Novax guitars, the multi-scale guys).  I<br/>asked him a while ago... but I think it was around $300, and would be<br/>done by programming his fret slotting machines.  Neil Haverstick has<br/>had all his guitars done by John Starrett, and also posted about some<br/>work done by Edward Victor Dick.  I&apos;ve seen mention of a few other<br/>luthiers in this list, but failed to bookmark them.  There&apos;s also this<br/>guy I found with google: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/yahnuit/micro.html">http://www.geocities.com/yahnuit/micro.html</a> .</p><p>Does anyone have anyone else I should keep in mind?  Also, aside from<br/>comparing quotes and general reputation, is there anything I should<br/>ask about?  I&apos;d want to make sure the instrument played reasonably in<br/>tune, including intonating at the bridge.  Thanks for any advice!</p></div><h3><a id=14765 href="#14765">ðŸ”—</a>Charles Lucy &#x3C;makemicro@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2006 5:44:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>We have used lotsa different luthiers in the UK and US, (all have<br/>been perfect so far - fingers crossed) for fretting over the years,<br/>and these observations/hints my help you.<br/>Don&apos;t attempt to DIY; I have tried and it is very difficult and<br/>frustrating.</p><p>1. As a player myself, I have found that playing with more than 25<br/>frets per octave is &quot;difficulty&quot; as you have to be very precise with<br/>your finger placement.<br/>2. 31edo is an &quot;OK&quot; sorta meantone compromise, but don&apos;t expect it to<br/>play the notes and harmonies that you &quot;hear in your head&quot; very<br/>accurately.<br/>3. I recommend new LucyTuned guitar players to begin with 19 frets<br/>per octave and add more frets as they become more competent and need<br/>the extra frets.<br/>4. As the frets are very close in the second octave, I use mandolin<br/>fret wire for the second octave.<br/>5. The &quot;dots&quot; on the surface fretboard may need to be moved, as may<br/>the mark which you see whilst playing. In your case, as it will be a<br/>virgin fretboard, remember to put marks on both the fretboard and the<br/>edge which you see whilst playing.</p><p>These webpages may be useful for you.</p><p>General guitar info.:</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/guitars_and_frets/frets.html">http://www.lucytune.com/guitars_and_frets/frets.html</a></p><p>Diagram at:</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/guitars_and_frets/frets_1931.html">http://www.lucytune.com/guitars_and_frets/frets_1931.html</a></p><p>Spreadsheet to calculate nut to fret distances.<br/>linked .xls page excel from these pages.</p><p>How 31edo relates to LucyTuning and meantone in terms of Large and<br/>small intervals.</p><p><a href="http://www.lucytune.com/tuning/equal_temp.html">http://www.lucytune.com/tuning/equal_temp.html</a></p><p>Here is a short video of a very competent guitarist playing a 19 fret<br/>per octave LucyTuned 12 string after just a couple of hours of practice.</p><p><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk/LullRehears.mov">http://www.lullabies.co.uk/LullRehears.mov</a></p><p>Best wishes and have fun with your endeavour.</p><p>Charles Lucy - lucy@... ------------  Promoting global<br/>harmony through LucyTuning  ------- for information on LucyTuning go to:<br/><a href="http://www.lucytune.com">http://www.lucytune.com</a><br/>for LucyTuned Lullabies, contest and Flash cartoon go to<br/><a href="http://www.lullabies.co.uk">http://www.lullabies.co.uk</a><br/>Buy CD from:<br/><a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lucytuned2</a><br/>Lullabies at iTunes (if you already have iTunes installed):<br/><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist">http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist</a>?<br/>a=5165209&amp;s=143441<br/>To install iTunes go to:<br/><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/download/">http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/download/</a></p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=14766 href="#14766">ðŸ”—</a>hstraub64 &#x3C;hstraub64@...&#x3E;</h3><span>9/21/2006 6:14:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Cody Hallenbeck&quot;<br/>&lt;codyhallenbeck@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, it&apos;s come to the point where I really feel the need for an<br/>&gt; acoustic microtonal instrument that I can really wrap my arms around<br/>&gt; and bond with.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve seen mention of a few other<br/>&gt; luthiers in this list, but failed to bookmark them.</p><p>There is a page with a long bookmark list in the Wiki:</p><p><a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/microguitar">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/microguitar</a><br/>--<br/>Hans Straub</p></div>
