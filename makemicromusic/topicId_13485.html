Perhaps we could talk you into getting involved with the government, somehow, maybe Secretary of State? We could sure use more people like you in the world. And I agree with your point, there&apos;s different kinds of music being made, and perhaps it&apos;s not always so easy to simply explain things to folks who don&apos;t have much background in tuning theory. Of course, since teaching is a large part of what I do in life, I am constantly talking to students, and most of them are not ever going to be professionals; they want to have some fun, stretch themselves a bit as people, and learn the licks they wish they had learned as kids (for the old farts, anyway).<br/>  And, there may be as many ways to approach theory/composition as there are people doing it, especially in the world of non 12 tunings...there&apos;s not a lot of standardization yet, and may never be. And, I also have written some pretty way out there stuff, and as I mentioned earlier on this forum, I am currently using a 13 tone scale derived from 13 limit intervals out of the 34 eq scale. And, trying to explain what a 13 limit scale is to folks isn&apos;t so easy, even to really advanced musicians.<br/>  But, that&apos;s why we study, and you gotta start somewhere...so, when I try and explain tuning theory to folks, the spiral of 5ths and Harmonic Series is a good place to start, cause those concepts cover a lot of territory. And should I ever have a student who really digs in and wants to pursue non 12 tunings, we&apos;ll punt from there and see where it goes. Hasn&apos;t happened yet, but several of my students are really interested in other tuning concepts, so who can say?<br/>  I personally detest any sort of elitist attitude towards any subject, so I think that&apos;s what I want to be most careful of in life. Art is for all, the way I see it, and anybody that wants to participate is welcome, at whatever level they choose (or are capable of). When I met Erv Wilson in El Paso in 1996, I must say that, besides being a towering genius, he was one of the nicest, most down to earth folks I&apos;ve ever met...there was not the slightest whiff of pretension or condescension coming from him. He seemed like a very simple person, and with the scope of his intellectual accomplishments, one might have expected a bit of ego snobbery to be there, but it wasn&apos;t. He&apos;s a real hoot, and the letters/correspondence I&apos;ve received from him over the years reveals great depth as a human being, and a sort of childlike humor towards life...he&apos;s a great dude, to be sure.<br/>   Anyway, thanks for the posts over the years, glad to have you on the list...best...Hstick</p><p><a href="http://myspace.com/microstick">myspace.com/microstick</a>  <a href="http://microstick.net">microstick.net</a>  PS...the Seattle gig with Catler and I is pretty firm now, as far as dates/venues...check out <a href="http://microtonalguitar.com">microtonalguitar.com</a> for info, maybe you Californee folks can come up and have some Seattle coffee with us in July...</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
