Its not as<br/>&gt; straightforward as it<br/>&gt; could be, but it works. I think there is also a big pack of .tun<br/>&gt; files you can<br/>&gt; get from camel audio. A .tun file just contains a mapping from<br/>&gt; input midi note<br/>&gt; numbers into fractional midi note numbers, also all the .tun files<br/>&gt; I have seen<br/>&gt; have 2 parts where the second is the same mapping but with higher<br/>&gt; precision.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; martin.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Back to top<br/>&gt; Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post<br/>&gt; Messages in this topic (6)<br/>&gt; 1c.<br/>&gt; Re: cameleon 5000 on sale 50% off<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Posted by: &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; jszanto@...   jonszanto<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Tue May 1, 2007 4:28 pm (PST)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Gordon/Martin,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; {you wrote...}<br/>&gt; &gt;Yes, you can generate .tun files from scala.

Good idea.</p><p>There are a couple of sites that have some info, but not as much as I had expected.  I guess it&apos;s really superseded technology!</p><p>Thanks again to all for their advice!  Much appreciated!</p><p>All best wishes,</p><p>Gordon Rumson</p></div>
