I won the Guitar Player Mag Ultimate Guitar Competition (Experimental Category) in 1992 (with a 19 tone piece)...for the 4 years previously I entered and received honorable mentions 3 times (which still got your name in the mag, nice press)...ah, but the year I won was the first year they had multiple categories; before that all entries were judged together. I doubt I would have ever won, but the addition of Experimental as a slot was a big help indeed. I won $5000 worth of gear, and they put out a cassette (remember those?) with all the winners on it...great press indeed, and many folks were exposed to 19 tone ideas who had doubtless never heard of it before. When I entered, I knew well that the editors of GP were the judges, and whatever they liked would win...simple, no muss or fuss.</p><p>   Also won a Composition Fellowship in Denver in 1999...again, nice $$$ and real good press...and it too was for microtonal music, my &quot;Acoustic Stick&quot; CD (19 and 34 tone music)...and, as with GP, I knew the folks at the Arts Council were the judges, and whatever they liked would win...no surprise there. If I was judging a contest, what I thought was the best entry would win...which may be different from what someone else thinks should win, and what can you do about that? I could only try and be fair...but my concepts of music would ultimately figure in greatly.</p><p>   The talk of a micro community is interesting...the online forums are wonderful (bickering aside)...but, I kind of see the whole world as a potential community. In fact, I just had an old friend (now in N Calif) tell me he put a fretless neck on a guitar because of my example...and I correspond with folks all over the planet who are getting interested in exploring other tunings; I&apos;m always sending out books and CD&apos;s. The internet is a great way to reach folks...but playing gigs around the world is also good, as is getting CD reviews in well known mags. John Schneider has had a radio show in LA for many years, and he was just at a guitar convention in NY which got his pic (and a mention of his guitars) in Classical Guitar mag. Jon Catler&apos;s latest micro blues disc got 4 stars in Downbeat (not so easy), and that writer is very micro friendly. Dave Fiuczynski teaches a micro class at Berkleee, and also plays with Jack Dejohnette, as well as many others in the NY jazz scene. There&apos;s also an unfretted guitar forum (<a href="http://www.unfretted.com">www.unfretted.com</a>) that&apos;s very micro friendly, and a guy named Willem (damn, last name is gone from my old mind) in The Hague that is putting on a yearly fretless guitar fest, he&apos;s also very micro friendly. Ed Powell plays fretless guitar, a combination of Indian/Mid East sounds, and just did a seminar in the Czech Republic. And of course, Reinhard has had a long running micro fest in NY, as well as putting out high quality CD&apos;s.</p><p>   While staying at Rahim Alhaj&apos;s home last year in Albuquerque, I met Bill Frisell, who played several of my guitars...maybe it planted a seed, who knows. If a cat like that gets aboard, it would be a gigantic boost to the scene overall. And fretless guitarist Ned Evett just did Joe Satriani&apos;s tour, opening shows for him (although Ned isn&apos;t really a micro guy...yet).<br/>All of these things add up, I feel...the more the merrier. Keep doing the competition, it&apos;s a good thing...worrying about the small stuff ain&apos;t gonna help much though; just enter and let the chips fall wherever. Humans are gonna be human, nobody is perfect...but I think the competition gets folks to writing and coming up with new music, which is exactly what the scene needs...best from the Rockies...Hstick   <a href="http://www.microstick.net">www.microstick.net</a><br/> &#x9;&#x9; &#x9;   &#x9;&#x9;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2011 4:17:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I 2nd that motion.</p><p>I really have no time to do another contest [I have *so* many more family<br/>commitments of a medical nature now] - but there is no reason someone else<br/>can&apos;t do it.  It takes work if you want wide exposure but surely is not<br/>difficult.

If it is kept friendly -<br/>all participants realize its all just personal opinion and good fun we could<br/>have  a blast.</p><p>As Michael knows the music module community, especially on IRC channels,<br/>often do &quot;compos&quot; - that is competitions - they hand out a sample pack and<br/>give the composers an hour, hours or days, and then the submitters vote on<br/>the complete set of entries (excluding their own). Here in our case, - hand<br/>out a tuning and a time limit and see what people can come up with. It<br/>shouldn&apos;t be a negative and might be good practice for next years UnTwelve<br/>contest.</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Mon, Jan 24, 2011 at 7:06 PM, Neil Haverstick &lt;microstick@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All of these things add up, I feel...the more the merrier.

They didn&apos;t offer me anything other during years. So I have to arrange everything concerning publishing my music (which is of course tough job and everyday fight, rather unsuccessful) and they take care for collecting and paying royalties. As my music is not performed often, and records I have published were done by myself, not by official publisher, still I didn&apos;t become rich from royalties :-)<br/>Then I had another income from incidental music for theatre which I did a lot in the past, that&apos;s another agency.<br/>And another agency takes care for using my records as a performer...</p><p>Nevertheless I think it&apos;s good to be a member of such agencies, or at least &quot;protected author&quot;. Especially when there&apos;s a chance for publishing and using your music. For sure there can be some additional income without additional effort, so you can be paid twice in ideal case. But there are also some duties from my side, I&apos;m not quite free concerning public use of my music, and all eventual contracts must go through these agencies.</p><p>Dues - in my country was not necessary to pay for entering, and they take 10% from my income all the time.</p><p>I also never understood their system of points evaluating the works, but I think there&apos;s some tendency to support art music against pop music. Symphony or opera has more points than pop song. So composer can get maybe same money from 5 performances of contemporary opera as let&apos;s say 5000 performances of pop song. Like this. So pop music is somehow sponsor for art music.</p><p>How to become member - their condition was to have published and recorded pieces, I think 5 was enough. It was different for composer of art music or for pop music author. But maybe now it&apos;s different in my country, and each agency can have different rules, I really don&apos;t know. You should find some information about ASCAP conditions, probably directly on their web pages? Or ask somebody in your country.</p><p>What&apos;s good - copyright and paying royalties is international, as national author&apos;s organizations cooperate and change information about author&apos;s and their works. I don&apos;t think this is quite perfect, especially recently with all this Internet, pirate copies etc. etc., but they try their best.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry not to be able to write more info as conditions are different in different countries. Besides I&apos;m quite hopeless as for financial things or laws, and my knowledge in this field is rather poor... I really don&apos;t like to deal with it and have to force myself to take care a little bit.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On 25 Jan 2011, at 10:52 PM, chrisvaisvil@... wrote:</p><p>&gt; Is being a member of an organization like ASCAP a necessity or a &gt; good idea if you wish to sell sheet music and/or recordings?
