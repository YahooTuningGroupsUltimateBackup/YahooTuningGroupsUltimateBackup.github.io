This one took<br/>me a number of hours to write (I know that<br/>isn&apos;t a long time as composition goes generally,<br/>but it is long for me personally).</p><p>But then after putting all that work into a piece, maybe<br/>later you find you make another one quite<br/>spontaneously and quickly, so there is a lot<br/>of interplay between the two approaches.</p><p>Or you improvise a piece, which may involve<br/>very little in the way of planning, things<br/>just falling together under your hands<br/>as you play. I think there is nothing<br/>wrong with theory, but it can be<br/>helpful to forget about it sometimes too,<br/>if one is able to do so.</p><p>It is rather easier to forget the theory<br/>if you never learnt it in the first place.<br/>I think one of the things in microtonal<br/>music is that we have such a body of theory<br/>based on twelve equal. So musically trained newbies to microtonal<br/>music and even long term microtonal composers<br/>seem often to focus on looking for new tunings for<br/>chords and chord sequences they already know<br/>in the twelve tone context.</p><p>But maybe in other tunings other rules and ways of thinking<br/>about things may be useful and helpful.<br/>Discovering those approaches may sometimes<br/>involve unlearning theory based on 12 tone<br/>ideas - which is perhaps easier for those<br/>who never trained in it in the first place<br/>:-).</p><p>There, one approach is to take a scale<br/>that can&apos;t be easily explored in<br/>a twelve tone way and these<br/>recent explorations of 5-et<br/>are a good example. Then to try to explore<br/>it fresh which isn&apos;t so hard to do<br/>as there is so little left of the<br/>twelve tone language to use..</p><p>I&apos;ll have to have a go at writing such a piece myself<br/>and see if I can do it - quite a challenge<br/>I expect. never written anything in 5-et<br/>myself yet.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7281 href="#7281">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2004 6:56:37 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Here is a piece for pan pipes and acoustic guitar<br/>&gt; in the Septimal Dorian scale of Al Farabi<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.robertinventor.com/septimal_dorian.mid">http://www.robertinventor.com/septimal_dorian.mid</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Scale:<br/>&gt; 8/7 7/6 4/3 3/2 12/7 7/4 2/1</p><p>These septimal scales with a small number of intervals seem to produce<br/>nice results.

I thought the comparison of<br/>Milton Babbitt to Josef Mengele was positively creepy, and I think the<br/>whole idea of telling people who use theory while actually composing<br/>that they are going about composition in the wrong way is not a good<br/>thing. Is it anyone&apos;s business? If Paul finds he can jam better by<br/>taking the theory out of his brain whilst jamming, is that a reason to<br/>tell *me*, a person not attempting spontaneous music making, that I<br/>should do the same? Again, whose business is it other than mine?</p><p>Can we *please* start the new administration out in a better way than<br/>by citing with approval articles which compare music theorists to Nazi<br/>butchers and claims that you cannot, no, no, not ever and please don&apos;t<br/>try, conpose and practice theory at the same time? I used to dread<br/>coming on this group because of the hostility to theory, and thought<br/>things would be better. I certainly do not think that Prent, a nice<br/>guy who uses a lot of theory, or Paul, the theorist extraordinaire,<br/>really intend to make theorists who compose feel unwelcome. But that<br/>is what the words seem to be saying. Compose and let compose, please!</p></div><h3><a id=7282 href="#7282">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2004 7:51:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>Sorry if my post was seen as critical in some way.<br/>It wasn&apos;t meant to be at all, not even slightly<br/>- but quite probably I may have expressed<br/>what I was trying to say in a clumsy way.</p><p>I&apos;m not trying to change the way you compose,<br/>or the way Paul improvises. Maybe with your<br/>approach, that spontanious composition that<br/>happens when one forgets about theory<br/>and just places notes never happens at<br/>all - I can imagine that might happen<br/>if the theory is so clear in ones<br/>mind that it is impossible to forget<br/>it.</p><p>Surely there must be spontenaity at<br/>some point, but then perhaps it happens<br/>at another level somehow. After all<br/>there is a place for spontenaity and<br/>surprising turns and development in maths<br/>so maybe that can be another way it<br/>enters in if one always has a very clear<br/>picture of the theoretical structure<br/>of the piece.</p><p>With me I have to work hard at keeping<br/>the structure of the scale in mind<br/>and then the spontaniety happens because<br/>I just get tired of that and put a whole<br/>lot of notes into the score any old how<br/>because I can&apos;t be bothered to keep working<br/>out where they should go - and somehow<br/>it works. That happened in a few places<br/>even in this piece. Since I&apos;ve had no<br/>formal training in composition and<br/>never studied music even at secondary<br/>school (apart from one year or so<br/>best forgotten), and came to it late only<br/>at university. that happens for me even<br/> when writing pieces in twelve equal - I soon get tired<br/>of trying to keep the various chords<br/>and things in mind in a piece even<br/>in twelve equal.</p><p>What I can&apos;t figure out theoretically,<br/>somehow happens by instinct instead.</p><p>My approach is quite eccentric<br/>actually, and not a model for anyone else<br/>to follow.</p><p>Actually even in maths I also find that<br/>the samething happens. I&apos;m not really<br/>a very quick thinker mathematically,<br/>and it takes ages to figure things out<br/>sometimes, but then often when<br/>one gets tired of it all and write<br/>down something nonsensical,it is<br/>a clue to the way to solve<br/>the problem.</p><p>Often I would get solutions<br/>to maths problems in my sleep<br/>when working on it - well at least<br/>don&apos;t know when the solution is but<br/>I often would wake up with<br/>a solution to a tough problem. That&apos;s<br/>commone with mathematicians. That&apos;s<br/>really the same thing that I was talking<br/>about here- the same thing happens with<br/>composition, that you struggle at<br/>a composition and it isn&apos;t clear how<br/>to proceed, then at some off guard<br/>moment it suddenly becomes very easy<br/>and you see how to do  it. Surely<br/>everyone experiences this somehow in some<br/>way or another if not quit in the same<br/>way of course as we all have our own<br/>unique approaches to composition.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7283 href="#7283">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2004 8:04:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>HI Gene,</p><p>&gt; Milton Babbitt to Josef Mengele</p><p>This must be someone else&apos;s post.</p><p>I don&apos;t even know who either of those people are.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7285 href="#7285">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/17/2004 10:51:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; Sorry if my post was seen as critical in some way.<br/>&gt; It wasn&apos;t meant to be at all, not even slightly<br/>&gt; - but quite probably I may have expressed<br/>&gt; what I was trying to say in a clumsy way.</p><p>Sorry myself, I was not directing my comments your way. I was trying<br/>to say, probably not very well, that criticizing people who use theory<br/>when composing is not a good idea. In fact, I think we should try to<br/>get away from these kinds of blanket judgments, whether of tuning,<br/>style, or method, and concentrate on saying something someone could<br/>actually use to compose music. I would like a composition-positive<br/>atmosphere to be established here, where no one is criticized simply<br/>for trying to compose.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;m not trying to change the way you compose,<br/>&gt; or the way Paul improvises.

Anyway, I<br/>don&apos;t have a musical keyboard, I have a QUERTY keyboard. It&apos;s not<br/>really designed for music-making. This is why I&apos;d like a generalized<br/>for-idiots program, where you could program chord buttons. Noodling<br/>around with a mouse using 5-equal and Scala or FTS is about my speed,<br/>though.</p><p>&gt; Surely there must be spontenaity at<br/>&gt; some point, but then perhaps it happens<br/>&gt; at another level somehow.</p><p>Well, ideas must come from somewhere, if that is what you mean.</p><p>&gt; Often I would get solutions<br/>&gt; to maths problems in my sleep<br/>&gt; when working on it - well at least<br/>&gt; don&apos;t know when the solution is but<br/>&gt; I often would wake up with<br/>&gt; a solution to a tough problem.</p><p>It&apos;s a good way to solve problems, but also a good way not to get any<br/>sleep.</p></div>
