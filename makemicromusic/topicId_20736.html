The harp-like sound is the &apos;pluck&apos; opcode, a simple model that decays like a plucked string. The synth sound is just a few- get this- slightly detuned oscillators, all run through some stereo chorusing, filtering, and compression that I tweak as I compose. I&apos;m a hypocrite for detuning those oscillators arbitrarily after all this work.<br/>The yellow notes, which have that kind of low helicopter sound, are using filtered noise in a pulse that is relative to the frequency; the noise filter doesn&apos;t change at all, but the pulse does. So lower notes are slower, etc. That&apos;s why the yellow notes don&apos;t fit with the tonality of the rest of it; I was just listening to the rhythm, not the pitch, with them. I work in a pretty disorganized way.</p><p>I&apos;ve been putting together (read: taking apart) a stripped-down version of the program to post to the Csound list to ask for help with that Windows error. I can&apos;t ask them to read my whole program for one error, so I have to take out 90% of it. What&apos;s really annoying is that the error itself doesn&apos;t cause any disruption, only the alert window.</p><p>Thanks for the note about the win32 package, I had completely forgotten. I need to make that optional. I only used it to raise the priority of the audio process so it runs faster than the graphics, and some people don&apos;t need that.</p><p>Pure Data is one other option for OSC. In terms of synthesis, it&apos;s about as complicated as Csound, but it&apos;s more intuitive as it&apos;s graphically oriented.</p><p>work, work, work.</p><p>-Chuckk</p><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@...m, Cody Hallenbeck &lt;codyhallenbeck@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Awesome music, Chuckk!
