This scale has been designed to minimise the maximum deviation from the intervals 6/5, 5/4, 3/2, 7/5, 16/9 and 9/5 while keeping the octave at exactly 2. The scale (as he gave it) is 1, 28/25, 6/5, 669/500, 3/2, 837/500, 224/125, 2. It is an irregular temperament of rank 6. Now that the lyre is improved, Michael&apos;s temperament sounds really really great to me on it. This solves a problem in that I was having trouble finding tunings that make the most of the 7 strings in chord playing (the strings are only played open so I only have 7 notes availlable in each tuning). To my ear, every major, minor and diminished triad and each of these with a 7th added sound great in this tuning. I intend to upload a recording of the lyre to youtube soon. Another thing to try would be to turn Michael&apos;s tuning on it&apos;s head since this would be different but still have the same dyad accuracy. The next thing to work out is how to tune the lyre to this scale at gigs (I usually tune by ear, which is why I tend to tune my lyres to 5 limit just intonation. It&apos;s much easier than tuning to a tempered scale in the absence of reference pitches.) Other tunings I have liked on lyre include 1, 16/15, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5, 15/8 on 7 string lyre and 1, 16/15, 6/5, 4/3, 64/45, 8/5 on 6 string lyre.</p></div><h3><a id=23728 href="#23728">ðŸ”—</a>Chris Vaisvil &#x3C;chrisvaisvil@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/2010 4:44:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>is there a way we can hear it?</p><p>Chris</p><p>On Wed, Nov 24, 2010 at 8:58 PM, Mark &lt;mark.barnes3@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve made the tuning of my 7 string acoustic lyre more stable and improved the tone (though it could still be improved on both counts) and tried Michael DJ TranceDance&apos;s 7 note scale again.</p></div><h3><a id=23729 href="#23729">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/2010 7:50:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mark,</p><p>First of all, glad you enjoyed it so much and thank you for planning to use it<br/>live and going through the trouble of tuning it on a real-world instrument. :-)</p><p>&gt;&quot;The scale (as he gave it) is 1, 28/25, 6/5, 669/500, 3/2, 837/500, 224/125, 2.<br/>&gt;It is an irregular temperament of rank 6.&quot;<br/>   I believe this is the version of my scale that approximate 1/4 comma<br/>meantone.  So it should sound good to just about anyone who likes the high<br/>dyadic (and triadic) accuracy of 1/4 comma meantone.  I&apos;m glad you finally gave<br/>it credit for being high rank and not some single-generator-type construct on<br/>bastardized version of 1/4 comma meantone (as many have in the past).</p><p>&gt;&quot;To my ear, every major, minor and diminished triad and each of these with a 7th<br/>&gt;added sound great in this tuning.&quot;<br/>    This is the advantage of this subset mode of my greater &quot;Dimension&quot;<br/>tuning...it&apos;s designed to be competitive with just about anything far as<br/>traditional Western intervals, including 53TET, 31TET, 1/4 comma meantone...but<br/>with minimax dyadic (as opposed to, say, triadic) accuracy among all dyads and<br/>not favoring accuracy of any one dyad over any other.  In other words it doesn&apos;t<br/>try to get the purest 5th, 3rd, 6th etc. ...it tries to minimize the maximum<br/>dissonance for any of the above and thus make nothing at all &quot;sour&quot;, though<br/>nothing &quot;100% perfectly sweet&quot;.</p><p>    However, I must add it&apos;s part of a larger puzzle designed to optimize both<br/>those dyads and things like 12/11, 11/10, 11/6 and more Arab-style intervals.<br/>   Easy example, if you swap 224/125 with 97/53 (about 11/6)...you get the<br/>&quot;hybrid&quot; mode (my favorite) of my scale.  That mode contains only one semi-tone<br/>(not two).<br/>   What this means musically is it mixes ability to do good 1/4 comma meantone<br/>emulation with ability to makes strong Arabic-style 11-limit chords including<br/>clusters like 10:11:12.  Plus it includes a diminished 5th around 22/15 that<br/>echoes its use in medieval music as a replacement for the traditional 5th for a<br/>new (though not completely as pure) kind of consonance for the 5th.  My Untwelve<br/>music entry used both modes extensively.</p><p>&gt;&quot;Another thing to try would be to turn Michael&apos;s tuning on it&apos;s head since this<br/>&gt;would be different but still have the same dyad accuracy.&quot;<br/>   Interesting, now how exactly would you do that; rotate the mode (same order<br/>of intervals but starting at a different root tone in the order)?</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=23730 href="#23730">ðŸ”—</a>Mark &#x3C;mark.barnes3@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/2010 8:41:47 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mark:<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;The scale (as he gave it) is 1, 28/25, 6/5, 669/500, 3/2, 837/500, 224/125, 2.<br/>&gt; &gt;&quot;Another thing to try would be to turn Michael&apos;s tuning on it&apos;s head since this<br/>&gt; &gt;would be different but still have the same dyad accuracy.&quot;<br/>Michael:    Interesting, now how exactly would you do that; rotate the mode (same order<br/>&gt; of intervals but starting at a different root tone in the order)?<br/>Mark: Basically, every time you would normally go up in pitch you go down instead.

The other modes in my tuning are anything but<br/>diatonic.  Now if you&apos;re talking a mere 4 cents off on a fifth as &quot;dreadfully<br/>flat&quot;...than you&apos;re right it&apos;s not an approximation...but I think MUSICALLY (IE<br/>in actual practice and beyond tuning math), people without uncommonly well<br/>trained ears will find the two scales quite similar.</p><p>&gt;&quot;It has one JI fifth, and the other perfect fifths are considerably flat of the<br/>&gt;1/4-comma fifth.&quot;</p><p>   Like I said, it treats purity of all intervals equally, rather than favoring<br/>(as often happens) the fifth.  It also depends what you hold to as &quot;considerably<br/>flat&quot;...to me 7 cents is not considerably flat and above 8 cents is around the<br/>limit of error where things begin to sound &quot;off&quot;...though it seems you beg to<br/>differ.  This is all calculated by an original computer program testing all<br/>possible combinations for each type of interval within 2 octaves, and not by<br/>some chain of fifths, thirds, etc. (or any combination of the above)</p><p>Me&gt;&gt; I&apos;m glad you finally gave<br/>&gt;&gt; it credit for being high rank and not some single-generator-type construct on</p><p>&gt;&gt; bastardized version of 1/4 comma meantone (as many have in the past).<br/>Gene&gt;&quot;Credit&quot;? It&apos;s not an accomplishment, and the same basic idea could easily<br/>be implemented in 5 limit JI.</p><p>   But, in that case, couldn&apos;t you say the same thing about 5-limit JI, 1/4<br/>comma meantone, 31TET and 53TET diatonic subsets, etc.?<br/>   Ok, down to business.  What makes the scale unique, as I can tell, is</p><p>   A) The way it handles mini-max, which is deliberately different than how 1/4<br/>comma meantone is generated to do so.  It&apos;s simply not calculated the same way<br/>31TET, 1/4 comma meantone, 5-limit JI scales...are.</p><p>     Yes, it does aim for purity of the same dyadic ratios the diatonic scale<br/>under 1/4 comma meantone does, but it does so without bias toward any dyad IE<br/>the maximum any type of dyad is &quot;off&quot; by is about 7 cents.  Yes, some of. the<br/>fifths are a bit more off than usual, but the maximum dyadic error is lower.<br/>   B)  The way it fits into a larger framework that can also be used for<br/>Arabic-type modes and in-between type modes within only 9 nodes...One which<br/>mini-max optimizes (in the same way described above) NOT only the standard<br/>diatonic scale, but also versions with one semi-tone and zero semi-tones<br/>(stacked 11/10-like sized dyadic).  The fact 7 to 8 out of the 9 tones are in<br/>common to any of the two scales, IMVHO, makes it an accomplishment.<br/>-----------------------</p><p>   What does this mean to the musician?<br/>A) Access to a very pure common-practice-capable scale that has an in many ways<br/>more predictable feel than many so called &quot;similar 5-limit JI-like&quot; tempered<br/>scales...because no dyad is ever off by more than 8 cents.  The difference<br/>between the most sweet and sour parts is made smaller.<br/>B) Access to an Arabic-like mode that maximizes purity of dyads again to a<br/>maximum of 8 cents (including close approximations of few new exotic dyads like<br/>11/9, 22/15, 11/8, and 18/11).<br/>C) Access to 2 hybrid modes that combine characteristic of A) and B)<br/>D) The fact ALL these Mini-max modes are available within only 9 notes...and one<br/>can VERY easily modulate between the modes, of which any two have at least 5<br/>notes in common (and many have 6 notes in common).  This, supposedly, also makes<br/>it simpler to map to instruments and simpler for a musician to handle (9 notes<br/>instead of, say, 31 or 53).</p><p>   If you still doubt this is an accomplishment...you might be very surprised to<br/>hear my Untwelve music/song entry and what it manages to do with this irregular<br/>tuning system...loaded with modulations between all 9 notes and showcasing what<br/>can be done with dyadic purity under every single mode.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=23738 href="#23738">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/25/2010 8:52:44 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Gene&gt;&gt; &quot;Credit&quot;?

I would have<br/>&gt; been making better use of the tuning in my opinion if I had tried playing<br/>&gt; sustained 2nds and sustained 4ths and other more comlicated chords.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOqXyCVaQBs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOqXyCVaQBs</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Speeding up the audio to match video and processing the video mangles the<br/>&gt; audio a bit, so here&apos;s a link to pure audio of the song on reverbnation:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/markbarnes">http://www.reverbnation.com/markbarnes</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Reverbnation the song is called &quot;Got Any Marrows? on 7 string lyre&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=23755 href="#23755">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/2010 8:12:03 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mark&gt;&quot;I would have been making better use of the tuning in my opinion if I had<br/>tried playing</p><p>&gt; sustained 2nds and sustained 4ths and other more complicated chords.&quot;</p><p>...And that&apos;s no coincidence...that mode (and in fact all modes in the tuning)<br/>are built with the underlying goal all chords (and not just the typical major<br/>and minor triads) should approach being equally matched.</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=23756 href="#23756">ðŸ”—</a>Michael &#x3C;djtrancendance@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/27/2010 8:40:52 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;&quot;you brought up ranks, not me:)&quot;<br/>    Mark brought up ranks, saying it was rank 6, before I said anything.   I<br/>elaborated and said &quot;good point, it&apos;s not low/mid rank, and shouldn&apos;t be<br/>interpreted as such...but instead it&apos;s own method to minimize maximum dyadic<br/>dissonance&quot; (one to two sentence response from me, and nothing more, certainly<br/>not an indicator to start a separate topic on it).</p><p>  But then a whole bunch of people began talking about the low to mid rank<br/>relationships I (and Mark, apparently) said people should avoid.  And in the<br/>last message I replied</p><p>&gt;&quot;the scale was generated by no rotation of intervals (2nds, 5ths, or otherwise)<br/>&gt;but rather a computer program that tries  all possible tone combinations of<br/>&gt;dyads for all 7 tones, via brute force comparison, and selects<br/>the one which conforms to a fixed set of dyads best within under 8 cents maximum<br/>error for any dyad from any root tone.&quot;<br/>...an obvious statement suggesting against sorting it or its chords by a rank<br/>system due to its generation method.  And yet people keep trying to do just<br/>that, push it into a low/mid rank system...as if they somehow know more about<br/>the scale than the person who created/generated it (IE me).</p><p>  It&apos;s its own system, not derived from any rank system, in which the<br/>mode/subset of it Mark used in his music.  Musically though, it just happens to<br/>be not too far from 1/4 comma meantone and has the added musical property of<br/>approximating all dyads with near similar accuracy (so musicians can expect no<br/>chords to be favored much in purity over other chords).  And that&apos;s the rap, no<br/>need to make it more complex (as people already have)...</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=23767 href="#23767">ðŸ”—</a>Mark &#x3C;mark.barnes3@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/29/2010 12:05:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ixlramp&quot; &lt;ixlramp@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Excellent lyrics as usual.

In those days I couldn&apos;t recognise just intervals by ear in the way I can now, so I used to have trouble tuning it. I am now tempted to build a similar instrument, but with bolted on adjustable frets on exchangeable necks, possibly less drone strings and maybe with the sympathetic strings spread out so that they can be played like a lyre (also possibly with movable bridges to that the sympthetic strings can be tuned to a wider variety of pitches without going too floppy or too tight.).</p><p>After experimenting a lot in 1996 I decided that it may be better when making an electric sitar (or sitar like instrument) to have the sympathetic strings contained within a separate box and not on the instrument. They could in theory be driven by an electromagnet like an e bow. This would mean that the instrument itself could have better sustain. The signal from the instrument would be amplified and used to drive the sympathetic strings, which would have their own pick ups. This would also mean that you could add many more sympathetic strings without increasing the weight of the bit you play. Another feature of this set up would be that you could drive the sympathetic strings with a microphone or the output of another instrument. Unfortunately I don&apos;t know much about electromagnets and e bows and so far I have not managed to make the sympathetic string effect box I describe here.</p></div><h3><a id=23773 href="#23773">ðŸ”—</a>ixlramp &#x3C;ixlramp@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2010 1:34:43 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Mark: Thank you.
