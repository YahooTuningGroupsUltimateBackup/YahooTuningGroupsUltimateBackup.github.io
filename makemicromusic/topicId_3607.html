One can<br/>really orchestrate for MIDI in interesting ways.</p><p>One can construct &quot;metatimbres&quot;.  Like in Stravinsky, Symphony of PSalms,<br/>1st  movement, there&apos;s this ostinato in the oboes, A#-C#-B-D,  and<br/>Stravinsky  orchestrates it with one oboe playing legato, and the other<br/>playing very  secco stacatto.  He, in effect, creates a<br/>new instrument out of the combination of two oboes.  It sounds cool.</p><p>I would think that this kind of orchestrational thinking is a way of<br/>getting even the most recalcitrantly lame MIDI timbres to make interesting<br/>music.</p><p>Ultimately, we need to think about these issues.</p><p>The number one complaint we hear about microtonal music is,  &quot;Well, it&apos;s<br/>impractical.&quot;  &quot;But you can use computers and MIDI.&quot;  &quot;But then it sounds<br/>lame, canned, cheezy and machine-esque.&quot;</p><p>Let&apos;s  work to change that.</p><p>It would be nice if there were some high-level tools that &quot;nuanced&quot; MIDI<br/>notes in a score one would write.  Putting very slightly varying<br/>amplitude, and pitch envelopes (via volume and pitchbend) on every note,<br/>for example.</p><p>Maybe FTS or Scala or one of those programs already does this, I don&apos;t<br/>know (I don&apos;t own a PC.).</p></div>
