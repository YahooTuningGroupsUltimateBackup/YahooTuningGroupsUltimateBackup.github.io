Since then, three concerts or &apos;phases&apos; have been organized with<br/>this name, which featured new 17-tone music by Rice composers as well<br/>as microtonalists around the world. For recordings and more<br/>information about the project, visit<br/>&lt;<a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/SeventeenTonePianoProject">http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/SeventeenTonePianoProject</a>&gt;.</p><p>Phase Four of the project begins with a CALL FOR MICROTONAL SONGS and<br/>culminates in (1) a sing-along/sharing on Saturday, April 26, 2008 at<br/>the Bonnie Brae house, and (2) a concert on Sunday, April 27, 2008 at<br/>Hirsch Orchestra Rehearsal Hall, Rice University, Houston, TX.</p><p>&apos;MICROTONAL&apos;: intentionally deviating from the (Western-music) norm of<br/>12 tones per octave, AND not restricted to 17 tones per octave either.</p><p>&apos;SONGS&apos;: anything unashamed to call itself a &apos;song&apos; is welcome. Some<br/>suggestions: art songs; madrigals; ballads; rounds (na&iuml;ve and/or<br/>virtuosic); canons; &quot;children&apos;s music&quot;; singalongs; campfire songs;<br/>musical games; pedagogical ditties and mnemonic devices; spirituals<br/>from another planet. The line between &apos;professional&apos; and &apos;amateur&apos; is<br/>blurred.</p><p>INSTRUMENTATION: Preference will be given to songs with at least one<br/>vocal part. Up to 6 voices (SSATTB) are available, but there is a<br/>maximum of 6 performers total, including the use of any combination of<br/>these instruments:</p><p>* the Seventeen Tone Pianos (see below for details)<br/>* grand piano (in 12-EDO)<br/>* freely sliding instruments: fretless strings, trombone &amp; slide<br/>trumpet, udderbot<br/>* standard woodwinds, brass, percussion, WITH the necessary<br/>attention paid to the rendering of the needed microtones (i.e.<br/>fingerings for woodwinds)<br/>* a variety of software and hardware synthesizers, capable of any<br/>tuning system imaginable, with various MIDI controller devices.<br/>Inquire for details.</p><p>Some performers can sing and play multiple instruments as wellÂ—inquire<br/>for details.</p><p>LENGTH: maximum five minutes for each submission.</p><p>REQUIREMENTS for submission: Send a score, recording, or even both.<br/>Include a clear description of the required tuning (and notation, if<br/>unconventional). Mockup recordings at learning tempo for rehearsal<br/>purposes are much appreciated! Send submissions by APRIL 1, 2008. Let<br/>us know your intentions before then, if possible.</p><p>Inquiries and submissions go to eptadecaphonic@..., or</p><p>Seventeen Tone Piano Project<br/>c/o Dan Sedgwick<br/>1618 Bonnie Brae<br/>Houston, TX 77006</p><p>VISIT: Let us know if you plan to attend. You may bring your own<br/>performers, or yourself as a performer, if you&apos;d like. The sing-along<br/>will be an informal opportunity to share, teach, and learn music. The<br/>concert will be audio-recorded at the very least.</p><p>PIANOS: the Seventeen Tone Pianos are two pianos tuned to overlapping<br/>12-out-of-17-EDO scales. Following the circle-of-fifths naming system<br/>for 17, the white keys of both pianos are tuned identically, to the<br/>(notated) C major scale (C D E F G A B). The piano called &quot;flat&quot; has<br/>black keys tuned to (Db Eb Gb Ab Bb); the one called &quot;sharp&quot; has (C#<br/>D# F# G# A#). Remember, C# is HIGHER than Db! In scores with separate<br/>staves for each piano, it is not necessary to spell chords with these<br/>distinctions; notating intervals in their most common appearance is<br/>recommended for quick readability, e.g. Eb-C in the sharp piano part,<br/>rather than D#-C.</p></div>
