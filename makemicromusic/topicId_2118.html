I also think that<br/>the issue of &quot;What&apos;s in the bass&quot;, i.e. &quot;inversion&quot; in the tonal-music<br/>sense of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc., is much too much glossed over in set theory<br/>studies in general; when it is in fact, very important to the SOUND of the<br/>music.  Of course, these thoughts will not be anything new to most folks<br/>on this list.</p><p>Hence, I am writing a piece in 19-tet, which uses as a harmonic &quot;basic<br/>unit&quot;, the sets</p><p> 0 3 6 11 13 16  =   C D E G Ab Bb  or transpositions<br/> 0 3 6 11 12 16  =   C D E G G# Bb  &quot;  &quot;<br/> 0 3 6 11 12 15  =   C D E G G# A#  &quot;  &quot;</p><p>These three sets, are, I think, auditorally far more related to one<br/>another (sounding as &quot;tweaked&quot; versions of one another, and of the 12-tet<br/>set 0 2 4 7 8 10)  than they are, in sound, to their &quot;inversions&quot;, in the<br/>set-theory sense.  (for example, 0 3 5 10 13 16)</p><p>So I set some rules for myself in my piece:  never use these sets in the<br/>set-theoretical inversion, and, as much as possible, use the sets in &quot;root<br/>position.&quot;---i.e. with &quot;0&quot; at the bottom, in the bass. . .</p><p>I am very much after a kind of general &quot;sound&quot; being attached to my piece,<br/>and that sound would be derived from the Just Intonation chord</p><p>8:9:10:12:13:14</p><p>Hence, it seems that the &quot;8&quot; should be in the bass as much as possible.</p><p>At some point, I&apos;ll post some pretty jpeg examples of all this.. . .</p><p>CB</p></div><h3><a id=2121 href="#2121">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/16/2002 2:11:37 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., Christopher Bailey &lt;cb202@c...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; As a composer working with set-theory tools, I tend to have problems with<br/>&gt; notions of sets being &quot;equivalent&quot; to their inversions.
