It seemed he lit a fire in everyone who&apos;d enrolled, through the sheer force of his outsized personality. I never dipped my toe in that well, but I certainly respected him as a true saxophone original and as an inspirational, practically evangelical educator.&quot;</p><p>Prent Rodgers</p></div>
