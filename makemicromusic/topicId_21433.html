I spent the evening trying different Linux sequencers (or &quot;DAWs&quot; as some of them now call themselves).  My preference is for Rosegarden because it&apos;s the only one I can get to work.</p><p>That may not help you.  But I&apos;ve also been playing with ZynAddSubFX, which is cross platform.  I&apos;m very happy with it.  It has a certain learning curve (and lack of documentation) but nowhere near as bad as Csound.  It does most of what you could possibly want from a traditional synthsizer -- no sampling or analysis/resynthesis or physical modeling but plenty of waveforms and envelopes.</p><p>&gt; I need suggestions for inexpensive, relatively easy to<br/>&gt; use software (I can&apos;t get a hold of more than a couple<br/>&gt; hundred at this time), preferably something modular and<br/>&gt; upgradable.</p><p>I was happy with Cubasis Audio on Windows.  It did everything I needed and probably still does.  There&apos;s an optional hard disk optimization that may have screwed up my system so be careful about that.  But if it&apos;s still available it&apos;ll either be as old as your Cakewalk or a completely different version.</p><p>You could learn to love Cakewalk.</p><p>                   Graham</p></div><h3><a id=21438 href="#21438">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/5/2009 4:50:36 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>jdstarrett wrote:</p><p>&gt; Suggestions?
