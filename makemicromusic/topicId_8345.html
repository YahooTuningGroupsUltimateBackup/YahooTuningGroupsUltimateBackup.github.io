What you say may be true, but I<br/>must<br/>&gt; agree with Igliashon about finding an alternative to the hex-lattice<br/>&gt; interface.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3 main things:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --&gt; There will be some spatial sacrifice with the design, you&apos;re<br/>&gt; right. But, the keys would be slightly larger to allow for that.<br/>&gt; Probably, the distance of an interval of a 9th (ie from c to high d)<br/>&gt; on a normal piano would become the distance of an octave on the new<br/>&gt; layout. Most pianists can reach a good 9th, and I can reach a 10th<br/>&gt; (and this is currently a personal project anyway), so a little<br/>&gt; stretching couldn&apos;t hurt. In light of all the benefits of creating<br/>&gt; several microtones inbetween tones, I think it&apos;s not so bad just to<br/>&gt; lose a little coverage, right?</p><p>I disagree.  The Scalatron with a generalized keyboard has the same<br/>center-to-center lateral key distance as a piano, but the octave<br/>reach is one key shorter (equivalent to C-to-B on the piano.),<br/>making the interval of a tenth a rather easy reach, which is mighty<br/>fine IMHO.</p><p>&gt; --&gt; Although the hex style is potentially universal, I must once<br/>again<br/>&gt; agree with Igliashon that we&apos;re not going for as many keys as<br/>possible<br/>&gt; -- we want to develop one at a time. The 22 keyboard idea is<br/>designed<br/>&gt; for 22-tet only. I still have so much to learn about this kingdom<br/>that<br/>&gt; I couldn&apos;t possibly make good music if I had millions more<br/>&gt; possibilities than I could handle at once. Out of our limitations<br/>&gt; slowly creeps creativity...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --&gt; The most important point, I feel, is that I would indeed RATHER<br/>&gt; have something based on, or similar to, the traditional keyboard<br/>&gt; layout, as uneven as it is.</p><p>But the Bosanquet arrangement *is* similar to the traditional layout,<br/>so much so that I could teach you to play a major scale on it (in any<br/>key) in less than a minute, using the very same fingering in the<br/>right hand that you already use on the piano for C major.  I recall<br/>that, as a piano student, it took me several months to learn my major<br/>scales fluently.</p><p>Perhaps I need to show you a diagram of this in *color* to get my<br/>point across (sorry, but you&apos;ll need to join tuning-math to access<br/>this):</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/files/secor/kbds/</a></p><p>KbScal5C.gif has the keys unmarked<br/>KbScal31.gif has the keys marked for 31-ET</p><p>You&apos;ll find the familiar white (natural) and black (sharp) keys,<br/>along with red (flat) keys and others (blue and green, not<br/>specifically colored for 22-ET).  Also, the keys in these diagrams<br/>are elliptical rather than hexagonal.  My point is that, whatever the<br/>key shape, the two-and-three pattern of the black keys is impossible<br/>to miss.</p><p>&gt; This is because, although I would have<br/>&gt; only to learn the hex system twice (once for each hand, as you<br/>said),<br/>&gt; I feel it would still be difficult to use and be inspired by a<br/>&gt; &quot;monochromatic&quot; design -- by that, I don&apos;t mean because all the keys<br/>&gt; are one color, but rather that they are all the same shape. One of<br/>the<br/>&gt; reasons the traditional piano layout is so great is because the keys<br/>&gt; are unevenly divided: 7 white keys and 5 black keys grouped into 2<br/>and<br/>&gt; 3. This way, finding octave repetition is easiest, and the shape is<br/>&gt; more organic or natural. Every key has its own different visual<br/>effect<br/>&gt; on one&apos;s mind. I think at this point it&apos;s probably just a<br/>&gt; matter of aesthetics.</p><p>To which I respond, *only* octave repetition is easy with the<br/>conventional keyboard, whereas with a generalized key arrangement you<br/>can have kinesthetic repetition with each and every interval.  If<br/>you&apos;re still skeptical about how natural a generalized key<br/>arrangement can feel within a relatively short time, then please read<br/>about my bedsheet experiment:</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_39323.html#39407">/tuning/topicId_39323.html#39407</a></p><p>&gt; Anyway, I definately feel there is something to be learned from all<br/>&gt; the designs out there. The general keyboard is awesome, truly, but<br/>&gt; it&apos;s not for this project.</p><p>If you say so.  I&apos;m sure that whatever you decide on will be usable.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cityoftheasleep&quot;<br/>&lt;igliashon@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Okay folks, I&apos;ve been at the drawing board all night, playing<br/>around<br/>&gt; with tessellations and generalized keyboard designs, and I&apos;ve come<br/>to<br/>&gt; the conclusion that they are not particularly well-suited to 22-<br/>tET.</p><p>Well, what can say?

Also, my<br/>design should be no more difficult to play than a standard keyboard,<br/>and it gets away with keeping the same span, key shape, and key<br/>size.  The generalized design requires the equivalent of at least two<br/>manuals.  It&apos;s more of a squarish design, as opposed to the elongated<br/>rectangle of a traditional keyboard.  Perhaps if I knew what mapping<br/>you used, I might get a better feel for the idea.

For most this never takes<br/>place, because, once one is comfortable with the existing layout<br/>(whether QWERTY or 7-white-5-black), there would seem to be little or<br/>no incentive to learn a new (Dvorak or von Janko) layout --<br/>especially when one considers that the installed user-base for the<br/>existing layout is humongous.</p><p>The only way most of us could justify spending the time and effort to<br/>learn (and money to build) a new, improved keyboard is if the new one<br/>could do something that the existing one was completely incapable of<br/>doing.  Aha!  Is this not precisely the situation you&apos;re in?  If a<br/>new keyboard is required, then why keep the inefficiencies of the<br/>existing 7-white-5-black?  Why not do it right?</p><p>The *reason* it takes you so long to pick out a major scale in a<br/>distant key is that there is a *pattern variation* among the keys.<br/>Eliminate that variation and you&apos;ve eliminated well over 90% of the<br/>effort it takes to master the keyboard.  Eliminate that variation and<br/>you would be able to play a major scale in any key -- blindfolded.<br/>Or you could play a major scale simultaneously in two different keys<br/>(one with each hand) in opposite directions without half thinking<br/>about it.  Or you could even transpose a simple microtonal piece at<br/>sight!  Really!  (No kidding!)</p><p>I just remembered an incident that took place perhaps 20 years ago,<br/>when I was the principal organist at a large Pentecostal church in<br/>Los Angeles.  I customarily played my own impromptu arrangements of<br/>hymns and gospel songs as organ solos for 15 minutes before the<br/>Sunday morning service, frequently modulating to whatever key struck<br/>my fancy.  On one occasion I took something lively (that required a<br/>bit of technique) that was originally in Eb and modulated to E, and I<br/>remember another organist (who happened to be watching me rather<br/>intently) afterward telling me how impressed he was that I could play<br/>in the sharp keys just as easily as in the flat keys, something I had<br/>long taken for granted -- but only because I had practiced my scales<br/>and chords in all of the keys many years before.</p><p>And now you want to go through all of that effort in 22?</p><p>&gt; The generalized design requires the equivalent of at least two<br/>&gt; manuals.</p><p>I&apos;ve found that I can get by with only 9 duplicate keys per octave,<br/>for a total of 31 keys/octave, or 1.4 manuals.  From experience I<br/>would say that the best cost-benefit yield for any tuning would be<br/>around 1.6 times the number of tones/octave, which comes to 36 keys<br/>for 22-ET.</p><p>&gt; It&apos;s more of a squarish design, as opposed to the elongated<br/>&gt; rectangle of a traditional keyboard.</p><p>One problem you&apos;re going to have with your design #2 is that it will<br/>be awkward to play the bottom note of a wide chord with the right-<br/>hand thumb on a black key if the fingers are also playing some white<br/>keys.  Duplicate black keys in a fourth row (closest to the player)<br/>would do a lot to remedy that.  The reason why conventional piano<br/>keys are so long is to accommodate the short length of the thumb.<br/>(You&apos;ll also find that you won&apos;t be able to get your fingers between<br/>those black keys to depress either red or white keys, so that part of<br/>piano technique has also gone by the wayside.)  When you start<br/>putting keys in more than a couple of rows, then duplicates make a<br/>lot of sense.</p><p>So you see that duplicate keys have two functions:</p><p>1) To preserve uniform patterns in remote keys;<br/>2) To facilitate fingering, particularly for chords.</p><p>&gt; Perhaps if I knew what mapping<br/>&gt; you used, I might get a better feel for the idea.</p><p>I don&apos;t understand what you mean.  The slightly upward-slanting /<br/>rows are 4 degrees of 22-ET, while the steeper downward-slanting \<br/>rows are a single degree.  On a Bosanquet layout there&apos;s no other way<br/>to do it.</p><p>&gt; But I&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; trying and trying, and I just can&apos;t find a lattice layout that<br/>would<br/>&gt; be simultaneously conducive for diatonics, decatonics, and<br/>porcupine<br/>&gt; scales.</p><p>No layout will be optimally intuitive for multiple scale generators.<br/>That&apos;s why the best strategy is to select the layout that will most<br/>easily and logically accommodate the most tunings.</p><p>&gt; Really, though, I think the bottom line here is aesthetics.

I also developed a well-<br/>temperament circle of 19 that, along with 3 auxiliary tones, gave me<br/>13-limit capability, and my interest in 31-ET has since that time<br/>taken a back seat.  Fortunately, all of these are easily accommodated<br/>by the Bosanquet keyboard, but had I originally gone with a single-<br/>purpose keyboard, I would have had to make the best of it with<br/>something less than optimal -- keyboards aren&apos;t cheap, and, as you<br/>noted, you can&apos;t get a new one for every tuning that strikes your<br/>fancy.

You may call this my personal<br/>preference, but I have found that there have been many microtonal<br/>people who are in agreement.  I would caution you not to bypass a<br/>design supported by a 130-year track record of enthusiastic<br/>advocates, especially since it has already been demonstrated that it<br/>handles the tuning you want to use extremely well.</p><p>&gt; You can calculate all you want,<br/>&gt; but at the end of the day it comes down to how a musician &quot;feels&quot;<br/>&gt; towards his/her instrument.  Different designs inspire different<br/>&gt; people, and certainly inspire different sorts of music.

Eliminate that variation<br/>and<br/>&gt; you would be able to play a major scale in any key -- blindfolded.</p><p>But how would you know which key you were in, or which chord you were<br/>fingering?  On a general keyboard, there are no *tactile* landmarks.<br/>I assume that that has something to do with why there are a different<br/>number of white and black keys on a trad. keyboard when an<br/>alternating white-black pattern would have worked equally well and<br/>would have provided (at least for 12) all or most of the benefits of<br/>your general keyboard.  One of the chief desires Stevie expressed was<br/>to have a keyboard where each key signature would feel &quot;different&quot;.<br/>Not this has acoustical relevance in an equal temperament, but at<br/>least on a visual/tactile level it gives each key a sense of<br/>identity.  This is definitely lost to a significant degree on a<br/>general keyboard.  You may be able to play by touch alone, but unless<br/>you look or have perfect pitch (which, in microtonality, is a<br/>difficult skill to master indeed) you can&apos;t know if you&apos;re in the<br/>right key.  And unless you can re-color-code for each tuning you<br/>might want to use, the &quot;multi-tuning&quot; advantage is significantly<br/>lessened.</p><p>&gt; And now you want to go through all of that effort in 22?</p><p>22 shall be effort to learn, regardless.  Tonality will have to be<br/>redefined.  Assuming I can produce a specialized design that is no<br/>more difficult to play than a standard keyboard, I imagine it would<br/>be actually *easier* to learn than on a generalized design, where<br/>you&apos;d have to visually memorize where all the notes fall on the<br/>lattice and navigate to them by sight as opposed to touch.</p><p>&gt; One problem you&apos;re going to have with your design #2 is that it<br/>will<br/>&gt; be awkward to play the bottom note of a wide chord with the right-<br/>&gt; hand thumb on a black key if the fingers are also playing some<br/>white<br/>&gt; keys.  Duplicate black keys in a fourth row (closest to the player)<br/>&gt; would do a lot to remedy that.</p><p>Indeed, I shall see what I can do with a four row design.</p><p>&gt; (You&apos;ll also find that you won&apos;t be able to get your fingers<br/>between<br/>&gt; those black keys to depress either red or white keys, so that part<br/>of<br/>&gt; piano technique has also gone by the wayside.)</p><p>There is no reason that my design should require less surface area<br/>per key than a generalized design would.</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t understand what you mean.  The slightly upward-slanting /<br/>&gt; rows are 4 degrees of 22-ET, while the steeper downward-slanting \<br/>&gt; rows are a single degree.  On a Bosanquet layout there&apos;s no other<br/>way<br/>&gt; to do it.</p><p>That same design may actually be applicable to my ideas...perhaps<br/>attempt #3 will reflect a similar layout.</p><p>&gt; No layout will be optimally intuitive for multiple scale<br/>generators.<br/>&gt; That&apos;s why the best strategy is to select the layout that will most<br/>&gt; easily and logically accommodate the most tunings.</p><p>To accomodate the &quot;most&quot; tunings would require compromise, whereas a<br/>specialized design can be optimized for the tuning in question.  I<br/>believe that for an inexperienced musician to play an instrument<br/>designed *specifically* for a given tuning will facilitate his or her<br/>ability to become familiar with that tuning.</p><p>Now, I am not arguing on a general scale here.  Nor am I saying there<br/>is something wrong with the generalized design.  It suits its<br/>intended purpose perfectly: to allow its player to utilize almost any<br/>tuning system he so desires with a minimum of difficulty.  For you<br/>and many others it is obviously exactly what you desire.  But for<br/>Stevie and I, we desire something specialized.  Granted, that may<br/>seem illogical.  But there is something deeper at work here.</p><p>I have been wondering why Microtonalism is such a small movement; why<br/>did I have to dig to find it?  I think the reason is because there is<br/>no unified support for a specific alternative to 12-equal.  For a<br/>newcomer, it is a bewildering world.  One finds oneself suddenly<br/>thrust into a mathamatical jungle of infinite possibilities.  Just<br/>Intonations, Equal Temperaments, Pitch Lattices, Vector Notation,<br/>Rational Notation, Horagrams, Partch, Sethares, Wilson...where does<br/>one begin?  I have spent the last year of my life attempting to break<br/>in.  I have spent countless of my own free hours studying what most<br/>here consider to be &quot;the basics&quot;: theories of consonance, the physics<br/>of music, theoretical systems for alternate forms of tonality.  I&apos;ve<br/>had to seek out individuals and ask them the most elementary of<br/>questions...all this just to be able to hold my own (if I can even be<br/>said to do that!) in a discussion forum.  And precious little music<br/>has resulted from it!  Few people have even spent the time to relate<br/>microtonality to traditional theory, or to design instruments that a<br/>neophyte could pick up and say &quot;oh!  So this is what 17-equal feels<br/>like!&quot;.  There are very few sign posts on this road.  To me, it&apos;s<br/>been very liberating and rewarding, but how do I explain this to my<br/>friends, those who HAVEN&apos;T spent the time that I have?  To show them<br/>the big picture all at once is impossible.  Yet I imagine that if I<br/>had one specific new tuning in mind, with specialized instruments to<br/>play it and a group of musicians to help me show it off, then maybe I<br/>might be able to help Microtonalism drag itself out of the shadows.</p><p>I am designing a specialized keyboard for 22 not just for me and<br/>Stevie but for EVERYONE.  I want something that anyone can pick up<br/>and say &quot;oh!  So 22 equal divisions of the octave looks like *this*!<br/>It sounds like *this*!&quot;  Granted, they won&apos;t understand it right from<br/>the get-go, but it will be easier to digest than an alien-looking<br/>generalized keyboard that can play in an infinity of tuning systems.</p><p>If you want to help, I ask you for ideas on how to *refine* my<br/>specialized keyboard.  I am not interested in a general keyboard at<br/>this time.  Some day I may want one for myself, to help me continue<br/>in my exploration of different systems.  But I am young, and right<br/>now I neither need nor want a generalized design.</p></div><h3><a id=8404 href="#8404">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/5/2005 3:35:48 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Igliashon Jones wrote:</p><p>&gt; I have been wondering why Microtonalism is such a small movement;</p><p>Because it&apos;s off the beaten track?

I<br/>don&apos;t foresee there will ever be unified support for one specific<br/>alternative to 12 tET. That means the wilderness will stay wilder longer.<br/>But also, it means that good tools will take much longer to evolve, or will<br/>evolve differently. The history of musical notation is only approximately<br/>1000 years old, and the common practice period with exactly modern notation<br/>is about 400, give or take. It took 600+ years in Europe to evolve a set<br/>of instruments and notations together as a system, and spread it widely<br/>throughout the continent. I wouldn&apos;t foresee it happening that way again,<br/>even at the modern accellerated pace of change.</p><p>Already look at notation: traditional notation can be &quot;useless&quot; for<br/>microtonal work. One could fret over that and either do it oneself the<br/>Harry Partch way, or ignore the problem the McGowan way. I ignore the<br/>problem by pushing the tuning onto the synth (VSTi with .tun files) and<br/>using traditional notation tools with radical interpretations. E.g., I<br/>notate 15 tET on an ordinary staff in Finale, using ordinary tools,<br/>commercially available tools. The acoustic octave in 15 tET is fifteen<br/>steps C up to E-flat. You can get used to it. Allows creation of music<br/>right away, instead of waiting for tools. And anyone who can find their way<br/>around ordinary notation can use the score on an ordinary instrument like<br/>a 7/5 white/black keyboard, without re-training. Yeah, it gets more awkward<br/>in higher ETs! But I&apos;m not going to get worked up about note names or<br/>notation -- all of which are merely means to the end of having the stuff<br/>get turned into sound waves.</p><p>In the future, there may be a wide acceptance of traditional-like acoustic<br/>instruments with non-traditional tunings playing non-traditionally scored<br/>music.

The current keyboard *evolved* through several stages<br/>over a period of several hundred years from a 7-tone diatonic basis. *THAT*<br/>is why we have 7 white keys.

There<br/>have been 14-key keyboards built, e.g., to get an extra sharp or flat --<br/>but these were considered modifications of a basic tone, due to modal<br/>shifts, etc, etc.</p><p>There isn&apos;t really any tactile advantage to the 7/5 arrangement, in my<br/>opinion. It is a hindrance to arbitrary transposition, and probably takes<br/>longer to master. (E.g., given a pair of identical twins, one raised with<br/>7/5 keyboard and one raised with a generalized keyboard, I would predict<br/>the 7/5 child to require far more practice with scales to become facile;<br/>and probably massively more practice to be able to do any site<br/>transposition or similar &quot;tricks&quot;.) A performer raised on a general<br/>keyboard would not have any disadvantage by lacking the tactile 7/5<br/>differences, I believe.

And just like you want your own keyboard, i imagine more than anything you want your own music. if you want to show people something it is &apos;listen to this!&quot;. we are not here to convert anyone to any idea they are not already inclined for, we are here cause we want to open music up to more possibilities, specifically using the parameter of Pitch.<br/>As our everyday experience differ more and more from each other, it seems the idea of &apos;universals&apos; are impossible if not undesirable, if we are to open ourselves from the varied experiences that cry to be expressed. One cannot compromise what one has to say artistically without risking saying nothing. Tradition will always be a well from which we may draw , but only those elements that serve in it being viable to our own expression. Look at Partch&apos;s instruments, everyone who plays upon them loves them  and these are instruments that have much less to do with tradition than bosanquet.<br/> i do agree with you that  an ensemble of instruments that can play a tuning is what is needed is exactly the path i have taken. i will warn you that i have gone through maybe 4 different tuning on this scale ( many other i have investigated, but did not hold me for one reason or another). Maybe you will be lucky and guess what you want right off the bat. I found though once i had a tuning, i would discover certain things that appealed to me more than others, finally it would get to a point that i would realize that i could do that with such and such tuning. other times i would want to do something that the tuning i had did not do, this is another reason to investigate something else.<br/>Partch did more for microtonality than anyone without a  doubt, and it was because he wrote music that worked, and although some have criticisms of his tuning ( me included) it does not alter the fact that his tuning inspired him to do what he did. The only argument really can only be what does another tuning inspire someone else to do.<br/> We know longer need everyone to do the same tuning. we have recordings  to spread our musical message.
