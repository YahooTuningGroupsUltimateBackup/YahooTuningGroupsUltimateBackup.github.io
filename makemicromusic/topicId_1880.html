I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s still much development of Timidity.<br/>But I had a nice idea: it&apos;s open source, which means that someone who&apos;s<br/>able in C (not me) can pick it up and add support for the MIDI Tuning<br/>Standard to it. Then we&apos;ll have a MIDI player with accurate tuning<br/>whichfor we don&apos;t need to use pitch bend messages anymore.</p><p>About playing lattices: I have begun adding this to Scala.<br/>You can play 2-D lattices of just scales now, in rectangular or<br/>triangular arrangement. Note names are given, where the ASCII symbols<br/>are replaced by their proper graphic counterpart.<br/>Use the Shift key to hold notes. The Control key will lower and<br/>the Alt key raise an octave.<br/>Go to Analyse-&gt;Lattice-&gt;2D Play<br/>Oh, there&apos;s also a chord player now, go to View-&gt;List of chords.<br/>The left and right keys cycle through the inversions and with the<br/>Shift key the common notes will be kept.<br/><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/Scala_Setup.exe">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/software/Scala_Setup.exe</a></p><p>Manuel</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
