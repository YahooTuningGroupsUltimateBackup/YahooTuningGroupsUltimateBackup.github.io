(That character may include &quot;bad&quot; . . but that&apos;s<br/>part of its charm . . . )</p><p>There are a  lot of pieces by the late Salvatore Martirano (a composer<br/>from U of Illinois, (I think he was one of Kyle Gann&apos;s teachers)),  from<br/>the 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s,  that use the cheesiest MIDI timbres you can imagine.<br/>But he uses them in such a way that they&apos;re colorful and humorous.<br/>You&apos;re not thinking &quot;Geez,  this would be cool if it were for a REAL<br/>instrument&quot;.  You&apos;re thinking, &quot;Hee hee hee,  that melody, played by that<br/>Elmer Fudd phat brass patch is a hoot!&quot;  and then &quot;Oh, listen to that<br/>silly low fart chord in the MIDI tubas.  Hee hee hee&quot;  and it&apos;s not all<br/>laughs,  sometimes there are sudden dark moments as well, made possible by<br/>a COMBINATION of the harmony,  and the timbres.</p><p>The point is, he composed FOR the timbre,  and made it work.</p><p>A CHALLENGE:</p><p>Write a piece with this specification:</p><p>1)&#x9;It exists ONLY as a midi file.<br/>2)&#x9;Therefore it will likely be played only on QuickTime instruments.<br/>3)&#x9;Your piece should be effective for QuickTime instruments.<br/>4)&#x9;Compose  FOR  QuickTime instruments.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;Message: 15<br/>&gt;   Date: Sat, 25 Sep 2004 05:51:41 -0000<br/>&gt;   From: &quot;daniel_anthony_stearns&quot; &lt;daniel_anthony_stearns@...&gt;<br/>&gt;Subject: Re: Sharing Music and Other Real Listening Problems<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Hi Jeff, I totally agree. But my personal opinion is that it&apos;s up to<br/>&gt;the composer to properly parent all relevant aspects of their music<br/>&gt;and that would certainly to my mind include a self-respecting<br/>&gt;attention to timbre and tone,etc. So my general rule of thumb when it<br/>&gt;comes to presenting a piece is that if it&apos;s not good enough it&apos;s not<br/>&gt;good--period. In my opinion, bad midi realizations are the main<br/>&gt;reason this microtonal community is taken lightly by most musicians<br/>&gt;who otherwise would seem a perfect fit.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/2/2004 12:25:07 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Gene,</p><p>Sorry I don&apos;t understand your point.</p><p>The main advantage of the Roland is that it is a soft synth<br/>so you can play music on it in real time. You can&apos;t do that<br/>with the Quicktime plug in as it comes. If you try and work<br/>around that you come across various issues, and it just<br/>isn&apos;t particularly satisfactory for that purpose at least<br/>I couldn&apos;t find a solution when I was looking into this<br/>- though it was a year or two ago now.</p><p>If all you want to do is to play a midi file<br/>and don&apos;t care to work with the sounds in real<br/>time, all you need to do is to show the midi file<br/>in a web page using the Quicktime plug in.<br/>All you need for that is Quicktime itself.</p><p>You can also use Roland to render directly to .wav.</p><p>I don&apos;t know about iTunes as I haven&apos;t used it.</p><p>The Roland soft synth is moderately<br/>priced and good at what it does.<br/>No drivers need to be installed,<br/>just the soft synth itself.</p><p>But I shouldn&apos;t say that it is the best<br/>possible solution, of course not, and sorry<br/>to have given that impression, it&apos;s<br/>just the best of the methods that I have tried.<br/>It is one way to make midi clips for use<br/>in quicktime. There are probably others<br/>as good, and depending on ones working<br/>methods</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/3/2004 5:46:47 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Robert Walker&quot;<br/>&lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Gene,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry I don&apos;t understand your point.</p><p>My point was that you don&apos;t need to spend any money to get Roland to<br/>render a midi file to wav.</p></div><h3>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/4/2004 10:26:42 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &gt; Sorry I don&apos;t understand your point.</p><p>&gt; My point was that you don&apos;t need to spend any money to get Roland to<br/>&gt; render a midi file to wav.</p><p>Okay thanks I understand now.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
