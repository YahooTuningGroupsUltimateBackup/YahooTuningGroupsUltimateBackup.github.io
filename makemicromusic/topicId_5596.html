But the right<br/>one is as good as new, probably hardly ever been used at all :-).</p><p>So it is not so very urgent after all and I can take my time about finding<br/>a silent keyboard. To think that all day today I have been<br/>struggling away with the left control key to try to get it to work<br/>sporadically. Things like if I got it to go on I&apos;d keep it down<br/>as long as I could and try to do several things at once with it.</p><p>(<br/>:-).</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
