I&apos;ve been out of *real* development for a while, so the last couple of years have been just spending time with html, javascript, and web-related stuff. I cut my teeth on Pascal, and while I went on to C I really started enjoying programming as object-oriented design/code came to the fore. I&apos;ve programmed in Java, C++, Delphi, and object-oriented Pascal since then.</p><p>And almost none recently.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
