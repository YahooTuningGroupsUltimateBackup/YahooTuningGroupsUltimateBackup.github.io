Why?  Well, I actually thought I was posting to this<br/>forum the first time.  I&apos;m losing it, obviously...</p><p>I heard Stretch in New York at the Coda club. That&apos;s Paul Erlich&apos;s<br/>group, as many of you know. They were quite good. I really enjoyed<br/>their playing, especially the first tunes. I had the feeling they<br/>were maybe playing it a bit more &quot;straight&quot; than some of the more<br/>experimental things I had heard in the past, and I didn&apos;t hear many<br/>microtones... at least not *intentional* ones. I also didn&apos;t hear as<br/>many complex (international) Middle Eastern rhythms, which I<br/>remembered from the past.</p><p>But, nevertheless, the club was cool... even classy with big<br/>chandeliers and a nice vibe. They played at what I considered a<br/>reasonable volume level as well...</p><p>Paul seems to be taking quite a bit of the lead guitar work these<br/>days, even though he said later that it was supposed to be &quot;half and<br/>half...&quot; His &quot;guitar chops&quot; are really happening now, so it seems....</p><p>Good going, Paul!</p><p>Joe Pehrson</p></div>
