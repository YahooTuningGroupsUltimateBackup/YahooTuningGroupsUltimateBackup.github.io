Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/29/2004 8:20:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Robt,</p><p>{you wrote...}<br/>&gt;Thought maybe you&apos;ll appreciate this beautiful 13 limit fractal tune that &gt;FTS came up with while doodling around in it today:</p><p>Quite nice. I am going to transfer it to my main music box and see if I can fiddle with it. If the tunings are spread across multiple midi channels, I&apos;m sunk, but maybe I&apos;ll just burn an audio file and save it for later mixing/composing.</p><p>But what I *really* wanted to say was that I found it charming for you to speak of FTS as an entity, capable of creating melodies! Of course I realize that it does just that, but you speak of your creation in a very charming manner, and it makes the experience (for me) quite intriguing!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=6758 href="#6758">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/30/2004 8:35:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>&gt; Wow, that&apos;s really nice.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For some reason, 13/8 sounds like the tonic to me, so I would write<br/>&gt; it as 1/1 16/13 20/13 22/13, or in cents, 0  359.4723  745.7861<br/>&gt; 910.7903. Very pretty.</p><p>Yes I agree, the 13/8 in this scale is perhaps the most<br/>like a &quot;home&quot; note and the 16/13 to 1/1 step particularly<br/>has a feeling of going home to it to me.</p><p>It is a close thing though, any of the notes<br/>in this harmonic fragement could function as a 1/1<br/>and as you play notes up and down in the scale then<br/>you feel that you could stop anywhere and also<br/>that you could continue going on to the next<br/>note up or down. After as long a pause on<br/>the previous note as one likes.</p><p>I suppose the feeling is that you can stop anywhere<br/>for as long as you like, but however long<br/>you stop, you could continue again at any<br/>moment and go on to the next note - so a<br/>melody in this harmonic fragment never<br/>really finishes :-).</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
