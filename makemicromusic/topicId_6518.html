I feel quite humbled to think that anyone would be inspired by what I have to say.</p><p>Hi all,</p><p>I&apos;ve put some midi files on my website, below are the addresses</p><p><a href="http://users.argonet.co.uk/users/mark.gould/midi/Prelude.mid">http://users.argonet.co.uk/users/mark.gould/midi/Prelude.mid</a><br/><a href="http://users.argonet.co.uk/users/mark.gould/midi/Scherzo.mid">http://users.argonet.co.uk/users/mark.gould/midi/Scherzo.mid</a><br/><a href="http://users.argonet.co.uk/users/mark.gould/midi/Lento.mid">http://users.argonet.co.uk/users/mark.gould/midi/Lento.mid</a><br/><a href="http://users.argonet.co.uk/users/mark.gould/midi/LastMvt.mid">http://users.argonet.co.uk/users/mark.gould/midi/LastMvt.mid</a></p><p>there is a caveat - Quicktime makes a mess of them as they use pitch-bends, so please use another synth that can respond to program changes quickly. They are all in 19EDO using the 11 from 19 scale. They are quite old now, but I&apos;d be interested in anyone&apos;s opinion. I have them as Sibelius files if anyone has sib 3 out there.</p><p>Mark</p><p>PS I shall be creating something in 25EDo when I get the time, soon.</p><p>M</p></div><h3><a id=6520 href="#6520">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/6/2004 7:41:31 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Mark Gould &lt;mark.gould@a...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; there is a caveat - Quicktime makes a mess of them as they use<br/>&gt; pitch-bends, so please use another synth that can respond to<br/>program<br/>&gt; changes quickly.

As I do<br/>sometimes with midi music, I&apos;ve done my own rendering to wav; I think<br/>the results are worthwhile.

This means it would probably be easy to convert your<br/>19-et piece into a 46-et piece with generator 17/46 and thereby<br/>render the tuning closer to just; how well that works likely depends<br/>on whether you make essential use of 875/864.</p></div><h3><a id=6524 href="#6524">ðŸ”—</a>Christopher Bailey &#x3C;chris@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/7/2004 12:03:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I don&apos;t have any Quicktime Problems here.</p><p>In fact, I&apos;d like to think that these pieces are well &quot;orchestrated for<br/>QuickTime&quot;.  I.e. I don&apos;t listen to them and think,  &quot;Gee, this would<br/>sound cool if it were on a REAL instrument.&quot;  Instead, I just think, &quot;Gee,<br/>this sounds cool.&quot;  So congratulations, you&apos;ve successfully composed FOR<br/>QuickTime, as its own instrument. . . .not an easy task to complete<br/>successfully.</p><p>The perceptual/psychoacoustic &quot;streaming&quot; games you play in #1 are great.</p><p>CB</p></div>
