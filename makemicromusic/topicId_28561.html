They have done it for several years now. The basic idea is that you record ten songs or 35 minutes of music, commit it to a CD, and mail it to the magazine, all during the month of February. It&apos;s a fun way to get off the couch and produce something. I&apos;ve done it twice, but missed out last year.

To me &quot;experimental&quot; is nothing pejorative, it means<br/>more something like &quot;unusual, uncommon, new, innovative, non-conform, original, sophisticated, elaborated, not accepted by masses...&quot; in<br/>wider sense.</p><p>From this point of view 95% of contemporary pop, rock, jazz, film or<br/>incidental music isn&apos;t experimental. And any microtonal work is<br/>experimental from the point of view of common listener :-)</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On Jan 19, 2012, at 9:47 PM, Chris Vaisvil wrote:</p><p>&gt; HI Daniel,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think that with some of the microtonal music being produced recently<br/>&gt; (think Elaine Walker&apos;s new album, recent work by Iglisahon, Jacob<br/>&gt; Barton<br/>&gt; and others) have trancended the level of &quot;experiment&quot; and have become<br/>&gt; &quot;expressive art&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And I think I can make an argument that a good portion of 12 equal pop<br/>&gt; music isn&apos;t much more than craft and certainly not art.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chris<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Tue, Jan 17, 2012 at 10:27 PM, Daniel Forr&oacute; &lt;dan.for@...&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; **<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; If we compare pop songs and microtonal music, then of course the<br/>&gt;&gt; second one can be considered experimental :-)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Daniel Forro<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; On Jan 18, 2012, at 12:09 PM, prentrodgers wrote:<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no requirement for style.
