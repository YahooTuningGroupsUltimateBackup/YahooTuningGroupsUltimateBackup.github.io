A traffic<br/>between imaginary beings [&apos;God&apos;, &apos;spirits&apos;, &apos;souls&apos;]; and imaginary natural<br/>science [anthropocentric; complete lack of concept of natural causes]; and<br/>imaginary psychology [nothing but self-misunderstandings, interpretations of<br/>pleasant or unpleasant general feelings, for example the condition of nervus<br/>sympathicus, with the aid of the sign-language of religio-moral<br/>idiosyncrasy-&apos;repentance&apos;, &apos;sting of conscience&apos;, &apos;temptation by the Devil&apos;,<br/>&apos;the proximity of God&apos;]; an imaginary teleology [&apos;the kingdom of God&apos;, &apos;the<br/>Last Judgment&apos;, &apos;eternal life&apos;].</p><p>This purely fictitious world is distinguished from the world of dreams, very<br/>much to its disadvantage, by the fact that the latter mirrors actuality,<br/>while the former falsifies, disvalues and denies actuality. Once the concept<br/>&apos;nature&apos; had been devised as the concept antithetical to &apos;God&apos;, &apos;natural&apos; had<br/>to be the word for &apos;reprehensible&apos;-this entire fictional world has its roots<br/>in hatred of the natural [actuality!], it is the expression of a profound<br/>discontent with the actual . . . But that explains everything. Who alone has<br/>reason to lie himself out of actuality? He who suffers from it.&quot;</p><p>or:</p><p>&quot;I make war on this theologian instinct: I have found traces of it everywhere.<br/>Whoever has theologian blood in his veins has a wrong and dishonest attitude<br/>towards all things from the very first. The pathos that develops out of this<br/>is called faith: closing one&apos;s eyes with respect to oneself for good and all<br/>so as not to suffer from the sight of incurable falsity. Out of this<br/>erroneous perspective on all things one makes a morality, a virtue, a<br/>holiness for oneself, one unites the good conscience with seeing falsely-one<br/>demands that no other perspective shall be accorded any value after one has<br/>rendered one&apos;s own sacrosanct with the names &apos;God&apos;, &apos;redemption&apos;, &apos;eternity&apos;.<br/>I have dug out the theologian instinct everywhere: it is the most widespread,<br/>peculiarly subterranean form of falsity that exists on earth. What a<br/>theologian feels to be true must be false: this provides almost a criterion<br/>of truth. It is his deepest instinct of self-preservation which forbids any<br/>part of reality whatever to be held in esteem or even spoken of . . .&quot;</p><p>-Aaron.</p></div><h3><a id=13745 href="#13745">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/22/2006 8:47:20 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;To quote Nietzsche:</p><p>I do agree that MMM isn&apos;t the place.

I don&apos;t think that&apos;s necessarily always true<br/>though.  People are capable of repressing feelings for their entire<br/>lives, if the punishment or helplessness early in life was strong<br/>enough.</p><p>The Dadaists, it&apos;s true, were more interested in liberation; their<br/>art was born of suppression, but did not perpetuate it.  Kafka, on<br/>the other hand, was seriously repressed, probably all his life, and<br/>his works really do dwell on failure and disappointment.  His short<br/>parable &quot;Before the Law&quot; presents a man who has a chance for justice<br/>and wastes his life not pursuing it.  Poe, too, when he asks the<br/>raven to leave him and it replies &quot;nevermore.&quot;  That&apos;s not liberation.</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jung would definitely question identifying god with apart of one<br/>self as<br/>&gt; leading to nothing but ego inflation. which i did need to be<br/>corrected on<br/>&gt; he would say that it is impossible to suppress anything, that the<br/>&gt; collective unconscious is more powerful than anything the ego can<br/>place<br/>&gt; in it way.<br/>&gt;  If fact the more one tries , the more horrid the form in which it<br/>comes<br/>&gt; out.<br/>&gt; I disagree that these artist had anything to do with promoting<br/>&gt; suppression, kinda like whipping ones self.<br/>&gt; If anything they strive to liberate us from societies suppression.<br/>&gt;  Breton is quite articulate on this subject<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Chuckk Hubbard wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I was saying that you said the same thing as Plato, that art is<br/>not<br/>&gt; &gt; truth.  I realize you meant it in a liberating way, which is also<br/>how<br/>&gt; &gt; I see it.  John Hollander made a big deal out of saying nothing is<br/>&gt; &gt; poetry that is literally true.  I shy from absolutes, but I kind<br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; agree with this.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I take a different viewpoint with suppression and god-instinct.<br/>I say<br/>&gt; &gt; the only reason god might exist as part of the psyche is to<br/>attribute<br/>&gt; &gt; certain desires to another source than oneself.  When people blow<br/>up<br/>&gt; &gt; buses or train stations in the name of god, that is a<br/>rationalization.<br/>&gt; &gt;  The religious beliefs they would cite are obviously false<br/>beliefs,<br/>&gt; &gt; and as such would not appeal to people who didn&apos;t want to do those<br/>&gt; &gt; things.    People with the same god, in other societies, might<br/>totally<br/>&gt; &gt; eschew violence.  Self-sacrifice has been around for centuries,<br/>often<br/>&gt; &gt; accompanying desperation.  On the other hand, people attribute<br/>their<br/>&gt; &gt; own altruistic urges to god as well, but really they wouldn&apos;t do<br/>good<br/>&gt; &gt; things, they wouldn&apos;t believe god wanted them to do good things,<br/>if<br/>&gt; &gt; they didn&apos;t themselves want to.<br/>&gt; &gt; In Jungian terms, one could say god is a complex.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I think suppressing feelings or impulses has always been a great<br/>&gt; &gt; source of inspiration for artists.

There are much bigger masters of variation principle in music history than Bach. His working style is not based on developing motifs and themes, and changing their shape or intervallic structure. It&apos;s more simple, more static than dynamic. Usually in his counterpoint works he used only one theme and yes, did bigger polyphonic works from it, but it&apos;s not done by &quot;developing&quot;, I would be careful concerning use of this term here with counterpoint. Motifs are just combined in time as they are, not developed. Of course he used intervallic inversion and retrograde of the motif, also transpositions and modal changes (mainly major to minor of opposite), and even shortening or atomization of motif, that&apos;s all. No developing work in the sense of later music styles (roughly said Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven started with this).<br/>Feeling of eternity, yes, thanks to the limiting the music to monothematic like in many Bach&apos;s works... I would say his music is more static then later styles. More abstract than programmatic. More meditation than storytelling. Which is truth for Baroque music generally.</p><p>Daniel Forro</p><p>On Mar 13, 2011, at 2:49 AM, Neil Haverstick wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;    BTW...the reason I love Bach&apos;s music so much is that I believe &gt; he was the greatest master of the variation that has yet existed. &gt; He could develop the simplest motifs into the most astonishing &gt; fugues, time after time.
