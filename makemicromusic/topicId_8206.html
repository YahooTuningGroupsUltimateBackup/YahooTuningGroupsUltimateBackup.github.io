By &quot;tonal&quot; I don&apos;t mean traditionally tonal necessarily,  just<br/>a harmonic &quot;area&quot; that sounds like you are in a certain &quot;place&quot; . . . .<br/>modulating doesn&apos;t have to be &quot;I V V/V V etc.&quot;  It can be a movement<br/>between areas that one can&apos;t really describe. . .</p><p>I would say that &quot;good pacing&quot; is not something you can build into a<br/>scale.   I suppose you could try to build in the possibility for good<br/>pacing . . .but I think it would be more fun to just make an arbitrary<br/>scale and then figure out how to pace well a composition or<br/>improvisation in that scale.</p></div><h3>Margo Schulter &#x3C;mschulter@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/9/2004 11:22:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; Message: 4<br/>&gt;    Date: Thu, 09 Dec 2004 19:59:22 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Chuckk Hubbard&quot; &lt;BadMuthaHubbard@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Theory and Tonality in JI<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve read &apos;Genesis of a Music&apos;, Fokker&apos;s &apos;Just Intonation&apos;,<br/>&gt; Chalmers&apos; &apos;Divisions&apos;, and a few internet and journal resources, and<br/>&gt; I have a decent set-up.

For example, my<br/>approach has been mostly to start with historical JI-based practices of<br/>13th-14th century Europe (mostly Pythagorean) and the medieval Near East<br/>(lots of emphasis on superparticular ratios, e.g. 12:13:14, with influence<br/>from classic Greek theory).</p><p>People like David Doty have produced some very interesting music based on<br/>&quot;What if...?&quot; questions, like &quot;What if conventional European theory had<br/>evolved so as to recognize ratios of 7 as concordant?&quot;</p><p>Sometimes there&apos;s the question of &quot;a specifically JI music&quot; versus &quot;a<br/>music that happens to use integer-based intervals, including some simpler<br/>ones.&quot; For example, the division of some kind of minor third into two<br/>neutral seconds is common in medieval and modern Near Easter music; but<br/>this might be expressed as &quot;64:59:54&quot; (Safi al-Din) or as &quot;14:13:12&quot; (Ibn<br/>Sina) or as &quot;13:12:11&quot; (one of my own realizations of this basic idea),<br/>or just &quot;a minor third divided into two neutral seconds, but with the<br/>lower one a bit smaller.&quot; The last concept is not necessarily &quot;just,&quot; but<br/>can be implemented with various just ratios, as in some of the medieval<br/>Near Eastern tunings.</p><p>Composers like Jacky Ligon are taking the approach of aiming not<br/>necessarily for &quot;simple&quot; ratios, but for relationships between often<br/>complex ones, for example the subtly graduated sizes of melodic steps.<br/>While small steps (like the well-known commas) are often seen as a kind of<br/>&quot;bug&quot; or navigational hazard of JI, they can be used to excellent effect,<br/>and I&apos;m trying to get into this more.</p><p>LaMonte Young has done fascinating things with very high ratios, as well<br/>as with comparatively simpler ones like 16:21:24:28. Alison Monteith has a<br/>very interesting article in the latest issue of _1/1_ on some just gamelan<br/>tunings of Lou Harrison and her process of building custom instruments,<br/>composing, and performing in these tunings as music for dramatic<br/>productions. Also, _1/1_ has had recent articles, for example, on the use<br/>of complex ratios as dissonances by Kyle Gann (curiously, I use at least<br/>one of these same ratios as a kind of &quot;imperfect concord,&quot; which shows how<br/>styles can vary)!</p><p>Over in non12comp, there have been some musical examples and articles<br/>about JI with ratios of 2-3-7, including some discussion by Aaron Johnson<br/>about some music he composed for a production of _Peer Gynt_ (well<br/>received).</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>hstraub64 &#x3C;hstraub64@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2004 4:42:08 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Chuckk Hubbard&quot;<br/>&lt;BadMuthaHubbard@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve read &apos;Genesis of a Music&apos;, Fokker&apos;s &apos;Just Intonation&apos;,<br/>&gt; Chalmers&apos; &apos;Divisions&apos;, and a few internet and journal resources, and<br/>&gt; I have a decent set-up.

It sees a<br/>modulation as a tripartite process consisting of:</p><p>1.  A NEUTRAL PHASE where the old key is weakened, e.g. by using<br/>ambiguous chords (chords that are common in both keys), or by entering<br/>quickly into the new key and coming back at once.</p><p>2. A FUNDAMENTAL to mark the turning point where the old key is left.<br/>This is typically done by using chords from the new key that do not<br/>belong to the old key.</p><p>3. A CADENCE to establish the new key.</p><p>With this pattern at hand, you can, once you have defined the scales<br/>and chords of a new system, determine which chord is to use in which<br/>phase. As an example from traditional 12tet: if you want to modulate<br/>from C major to G major, ambiguous triads are C, Em, G and Am while<br/>all triads containing the f# are candidates to mark the fundamental<br/>step. As for the cadence, one of its purposes is to uniquely establish<br/>the new key. This led to the idea of the &quot;cadencial set&quot; (Mazzola),<br/>which is defined as a set of chords that determine a key completely.<br/>Using again an example from 12tet: The chords IV and V uniquely fix a<br/>certain major key, as well as the chords V7 and I - which may be one<br/>of the reasons that these became popular as parts of classical cadences.</p><p>I have used this pattern for a composition of mine - not microtonal<br/>(yet...), but based on non-classical scale.

By medients ratio which are midway between two others. Ptolemy mention also the division of three also besides two.

One can take the resources of 20th century music and interpret the harmonic language of the variety of pieces in term of JI ( correctly or incorrectly, the idea is to examine approaches) to se what appeals to ones palette.</p><p>Margo Schulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; Sometimes there&apos;s the question of &quot;a specifically JI music&quot; versus &quot;a<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;music that happens to use integer-based intervals, including some simpler<br/>&gt;ones.&quot; For example, the division of some kind of minor third into two<br/>&gt;neutral seconds is common in medieval and modern Near Easter music; but<br/>&gt;this might be expressed as &quot;64:59:54&quot; (Safi al-Din) or as &quot;14:13:12&quot; (Ibn<br/>&gt;Sina) or as &quot;13:12:11&quot; (one of my own realizations of this basic idea),<br/>&gt;or just &quot;a minor third divided into two neutral seconds, but with the<br/>&gt;lower one a bit smaller.&quot; The last concept is not necessarily &quot;just,&quot; but<br/>&gt;can be implemented with various just ratios, as in some of the medieval<br/>&gt;Near Eastern tunings.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  &gt;</p><p>--<br/>Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria Island &lt;<a href="http://anaphoria.com/">http://anaphoria.com/</a>&gt;<br/>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>KXLU &lt;<a href="http://www.kxlu.com/main.html">http://www.kxlu.com/main.html</a>&gt; 88.9 FM Wed 8-9 pm Los Angeles</p></div><h3>Chuckk Hubbard &#x3C;BadMuthaHubbard@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/10/2004 9:15:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hstraub64&quot; &lt;hstraub64@t...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Chuckk Hubbard&quot;<br/>&gt; &lt;BadMuthaHubbard@h...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hi.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve read &apos;Genesis of a Music&apos;, Fokker&apos;s &apos;Just Intonation&apos;,<br/>&gt; &gt; Chalmers&apos; &apos;Divisions&apos;, and a few internet and journal resources,<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; I have a decent set-up.

A CADENCE to establish the new key.</p><p>I remember that now.  Schoenberg&apos;s Theory was my first book, that I<br/>used to compose my audition pieces, though I used his ideas<br/>loosely.  Very, very stimulating.<br/>I think, though, that even using a dominant as an identifying factor<br/>can become just one more part of a broader vocabulary.  To say<br/>tonality is dependent on certain cadences seems like getting hung up<br/>on convention.  I&apos;m learning about jazz in school, and am kind of<br/>disappointed.  This ii-V-I/i stuff is overrated.  Once the brain<br/>notices such a progression in several places in a short time,<br/>the &quot;simplest possible figure&quot; is updated to allow for it as a<br/>device, a gesture, rather than a defining element.  My teachers are<br/>trapped in it, arguing whether you&apos;re &quot;really in&quot; whichever key<br/>without any acoustic or cognitive background as to where that comes<br/>from.<br/>Most teachers either just say &quot;we&apos;re used to hearing it so we expect<br/>it&quot; and leave it at that, or say &quot;it&apos;s based on natural harmonics<br/>and is universal&quot; and leave it at that.  No doubt both things are<br/>factors, but should be the start, not the end, of inquiry.</p><p><a href="http://homepages.ius.edu/RALLMAN/gestalt.html">http://homepages.ius.edu/RALLMAN/gestalt.html</a><br/>Wonderful illustrations:<br/><a href="http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~saul/essays/05lawsPercept.html">http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~saul/essays/05lawsPercept.html</a></p><p>The fundamental answer, to me, is the Law of Pragnanz.  A piece is<br/>defined by the simplest way of explaining its structure.  Whenever a<br/>new element defies that structure, its consonance/dissonance depends<br/>on to what level the whole must be redefined (in the listener&apos;s<br/>mind) to incorporate the change.</p><p>In regards to &quot;We&apos;re just used to hearing it&quot;, it is true that<br/>humans will accept just about any stimulus through familiarity,<br/>whether it is &quot;understood&quot; or not.  Like a microwave oven: people<br/>don&apos;t know how it works, but have accepted that it does and that it<br/>belongs there, and they know its purpose.  They have some<br/>association for it, so they &quot;know what it is&quot;.  But a progression<br/>descending by 5ths, more than once, already has an inherent<br/>structure that is not dependent on having &quot;gotten used to it&quot;.<br/>Meyer points out, in the part of &quot;Emotion and Meaning In Music&quot; that<br/>I&apos;ve just gotten to, that the wilder and more chaotic music is, the<br/>less surprise is possible in it.  Once the listener doesn&apos;t know<br/>what to expect, they can&apos;t be surprised.</p><p>Also interesting is &quot;The Magical Number Seven Plus or Minus Two&quot;<br/><a href="http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html">http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html</a></p><p>He says we respond to an overload of info by making *simultaneous*<br/>judgments of several factors, increasing the possible categories for<br/>discernment.  Also, &quot;chunking&quot;, whereby we can log the details and<br/>the broader things separately but with similar definitions......</p><p>I think all these things are compelling for the microtonalist,<br/>implying principles by which our explorations will be accepted or<br/>rejected by other musicians, which in turn determines the quality of<br/>the works of future generations of microtonalists.</p><p>Your ideas sound interesting and exploratory, it sounds like you&apos;re<br/>applying this sort of stuff (lately I&apos;m only talking about it).</p><p>See you.<br/>Chuckk</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; With this pattern at hand, you can, once you have defined the<br/>scales<br/>&gt; and chords of a new system, determine which chord is to use in<br/>which<br/>&gt; phase.
