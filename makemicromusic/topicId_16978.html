Perhaps like Partch, I find<br/>that taking it out of context and turning it into a thing-in-and-<br/>of-itself takes away much of the value for me.

The great<br/>instrument designer/inventor Pete Blasser lives in a house he bought<br/>for about $50K in one of the ugliest parts of Baltimore, but the low<br/>housing prices is what is attracting artists to that area, despite the<br/>ghetto image.

Of course, the pay isn&apos;t as good either, but may compare very favorably with the cost of a local starter home.

That&apos;s why teaching is often the best, but its also a<br/>long road to get there, since you usually have to do something really<br/>great, and then get offers to teach.</p><p>However there are sometimes gigs at the local community college. One<br/>friend who does music full time has a wife who&apos;s a doctor and then he<br/>teaches at the local community college.</p><p>I&apos;ve been too intimidated to go for those, oftentimes the openings<br/>that come up, like one at CalArts, are looking for an artist with all<br/>the past experience and super-credentials of a composer like Morton<br/>Subotnick, so whatever a person does for a living as a &quot;day job&quot; it<br/>often takes a lot of dedication and missed sleep to really make it<br/>happen, and a pit-bull like tenacity.</p><p>Ultimately for most experimental artists having a stable academic gig<br/>is really the golden ticket, though you won&apos;t be able to buy an<br/>aquarium full of sharks and a lear jey like Barry White, its possible<br/>to live a reasonable lifestyle and do nothing but music, and teaching<br/>music, but that&apos;s probably the least harmful end for a pure artist.</p></div><h3><a id=17095 href="#17095">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;gbreed@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/14/2007 10:55:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Magnus Jonsson wrote:<br/>&gt; Ugh, June that is.<br/>&gt; &gt; On Mon, 14 May 2007, Magnus Jonsson wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Are you near Beijing Graham?
