I was in no way attempting to take away from their approach. In fact it seems to me this is the actual goal. the availability of such emotional shading. But the problem is more complex for a variety of reasons.</p><p>   We tend to view the romantic era as the great period of musical emotional expression, yet as Bartok pointed out, the emotions to be expressed were limited to a few and that only in the modern period were composers free to explore others that had not been touched upon. Whereas others composers saw the early 20th century as a turn away from the emotions, he saw it as a further liberation.</p><p>   The problem, as i see it is that we could have a completely open array of possible choices, but more often than not , it is the actual pitch array, or we might say master scale that is responsible for the results Ivor Derrig is a good example, although not the first of the latter and the shuti system of India is a possible example of a system that combines both, self containment that allows  commatic fluctuations.<br/>      Ways in which this problem could be approached :<br/>   1. The use of ambiguous intervals that performers will consciously or subconsciously modify in actual performance. This is the method of 12 ET for the most part.<br/>   2.  The use of set intervals with those in-between being flexible. This can be seen pretty much in tetrachordal scales the tones in between vary.<br/>   3. Scales formed by a chain or possibly combined chains (as in Margo&apos;s case, although 2 would also apply to her approach ). This would include Chains that created &apos;near misses&apos; that would function as alternative intonations of other pitches ( as mentioned in the persian-indian) scales</p><p>   I put this forth for others to possibly fill in the gaps.</p><p>George D.

In the 20th century, composers almost let go of<br/>all the composing restrictions, and they became more fully able to<br/>express themselves through harmony and structure not previously<br/>acceptable.</p><p>  However, the Romantic period might always be remembered as<br/>the &quot;sweet spot&quot; of musical emotion because the music was generally<br/>more expressive and emotional than in the Classical era, but non-<br/>musicians could still relate to it. I unfortunately know few people,<br/>if any, who enjoy 20th century &quot;neo-classical&quot; music, who aren&apos;t<br/>musicians themselves. It&apos;s just not &quot;pretty&quot; to them, so it seems<br/>cold rather than emotional.</p><p>  Even I didn&apos;t like much 20th century until I heard Bartok.

Music is<br/>certainly expressing something very precise (at least as precise as any<br/>language) but calling it &quot;emotions&quot; can be either misleading or limiting.<br/>While some music can be related to our emotional states in a broad and<br/>general way (&quot;happy&quot;, &quot;sad&quot;, &quot;tragic&quot;, &quot;longing&quot;), most of it cannot be so<br/>easily mapped. Programmatic music is a novelty, and I would classify<br/>depiction of emotional states as programmatic. Or maybe its better to say<br/>that music can express (or suggest) all human emotions as just one small<br/>subset of its capabilities, but that music as a language has a lot more to<br/>speak of. Music is also a tool or catalyst in that it can induce<br/>non-ordinary states of consciousness, and then its purpose is not at all to<br/>express emotions. This is probably found even more in other cultures.</p><p>I think western romantic music comes from a period in which intellectuals<br/>and artists philosophically valued human emotion, and therefore wanted to<br/>express it in music. They did a great job of it too, but its only one of the<br/>many possible things music can be about, and of course it was a group<br/>project relying on cultural consensus of how certain harmonies, textures,<br/>dynamics, and gestures would be agreed upon to represent certain emotions.<br/>It might be argued that it was a purely arbitrary assignment, and the<br/>listener too must &quot;learn the code&quot; before the emotional expression is<br/>intelligible. Just about the only thing I can think of that &gt;might&lt; be<br/>coming from the sounds themselves is the major/minor triad associations with<br/>light and dark, but I&apos;m not really convinced of that either.</p><p>Before the late 16th c. I don&apos;t think you can find much overt emotional<br/>expression in music. And once the various forms of nontonal music are<br/>reached in the 20th c, it doesn&apos;t seem to be about emotion any more either<br/>(unless its all about &quot;anxiety&quot;, but that&apos;s not in the music- that&apos;s the<br/>listeners response to noise and/or the disorientation of not having a tonal<br/>center and subsets of senarius partials (a.k.a. &quot;triads&quot;) flitting about.)</p><p>All the various 20th c &quot;dialects&quot; require at least some investment of time<br/>before they can begin to be understood. In this way they are no different<br/>than any other music, but with, say, the romantic period, you just had to<br/>learn one dialect and could then appreciate all (or most of) the music being<br/>made, whereas in the 20th c. it is more the case that each composer requires<br/>learning a new dialect, and you&apos;re not even sure if its worth it until you<br/>put in the time and effort, at which point you may decide it wasn&apos;t. Its<br/>like learning a new language to see what people are talking about in it, and<br/>then finding out they&apos;re just bullshitting or babbling.

Whether this is true or not , i will need to think about.<br/>As to the Andean or other non european culture reaction to european music, i would say, it must have something that is almost immediately expressible , otherwise, western music and instruments would not and could not expand to such regions so easily.

I would say that we are for the most part unconscious of what they are. (since we are always trying to get them out of the way). A lack of differentiation is a  clear sign of unconsciousness of something. The Japanese have over 50 words for silence, all in regard to the character of the silence.<br/>    In order to substantiate that music expresses something beyond emotion and the activation of various conscious states. ( the latter , i think the west has been able to get to via a relationship with painting) We need to know what these are, in order to really understand what is going on .<br/>I am not stating that music , especially in the west has not attempted to go beyond these, but we need to take an honest look to see , if this or could be possible.  In defense of this thread, i had also attempted to convey how this subject , sets goals and problems for the art of music beside the technological ones.

Hence my interest in microtonal music....<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I like Wittgenstein&apos;s quote, &quot;After silence, that which comes<br/>nearest to<br/>&gt; &gt;expressing the inexpressible is music&quot;.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Regarding universality of emotional gesture, Darwin did work on<br/>&gt; &gt;that, and many<br/>&gt; &gt;post-Darwin neuroscientists, and it&apos;s pretty well established that<br/>&gt; &gt;there are<br/>&gt; &gt;universal gestures and facial expressions for the basic emotional<br/>&gt; &gt;states, no<br/>&gt; &gt;cultural exceptions, and I see no reason that music cannot<br/>&gt; &gt;reasonably &apos;map&apos;<br/>&gt; &gt;these. As a thought experiment, try to imagine writing a musical<br/>passage<br/>&gt; &gt;which presumably expresses grief that is fortissimo, all sixteenth<br/>&gt; &gt;notes and<br/>&gt; &gt;quarter note=200! Anger maybe, joy maybe, but not grief. I *do*<br/>&gt; &gt;agree that no<br/>&gt; &gt;two individuals are bound to feel *exactly* the same thing<br/>listening to a<br/>&gt; &gt;given piece, but the subjective realm is impossible to penetrate,<br/>&gt; &gt;so we will<br/>&gt; &gt;never know. The closest we can come is the faith that neural<br/>&gt; &gt;states exactly<br/>&gt; &gt;map to subjective states, and read the neural measurements of<br/>several<br/>&gt; &gt;subjects. Maybe people do &quot;feel&quot; the same things, but like certain<br/>&gt; &gt;feelings<br/>&gt; &gt;over others. Or we are culturally trained to favor certain<br/>feelings, and<br/>&gt; &gt;shamed out of others.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Sylvan Tomkins and other have suggested that there are a few basic<br/>&gt; &gt;emotional<br/>&gt; &gt;states we have at birth as infants (I think 5? does anyone know<br/>this), and<br/>&gt; &gt;that all the others are complexes of this basic set. Makes sense<br/>to me--we<br/>&gt; &gt;are hard-wired for some, and maybe culturally influenced to<br/>produce others<br/>&gt; &gt;through the cultural-linguistic influence which effects their<br/>combination.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;I think what you might be trying to say is that music cannot tell<br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt;programmatic story with precision, which Bernstein so aptly<br/>&gt; &gt;demonstrated in<br/>&gt; &gt;his Young People&apos;s concerts.

Music is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; certainly expressing something very precise (at least as precise<br/>as any<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; language) but calling it &quot;emotions&quot; can be either misleading or<br/>limiting.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; While some music can be related to our emotional states in a<br/>broad and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; general way (&quot;happy&quot;, &quot;sad&quot;, &quot;tragic&quot;, &quot;longing&quot;), most of it<br/>&gt; &gt;cannot be so<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; easily mapped. Programmatic music is a novelty, and I would<br/>classify<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; depiction of emotional states as programmatic. Or maybe its<br/>better to say<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; that music can express (or suggest) all human emotions as just<br/>one small<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; subset of its capabilities, but that music as a language has a<br/>&gt; &gt;lot more to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; speak of. Music is also a tool or catalyst in that it can induce<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; non-ordinary states of consciousness, and then its purpose is<br/>&gt; &gt;not at all to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; express emotions. This is probably found even more in other<br/>cultures.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; I think western romantic music comes from a period in which<br/>intellectuals<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and artists philosophically valued human emotion, and therefore<br/>wanted to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; express it in music. They did a great job of it too, but its<br/>only one of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the many possible things music can be about, and of course it<br/>was a group<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; project relying on cultural consensus of how certain harmonies,<br/>textures,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; dynamics, and gestures would be agreed upon to represent certain<br/>&gt; &gt;emotions.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; It might be argued that it was a purely arbitrary assignment,<br/>and the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; listener too must &quot;learn the code&quot; before the emotional<br/>expression is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; intelligible. Just about the only thing I can think of that<br/>&gt;might&lt; be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; coming from the sounds themselves is the major/minor triad<br/>associations<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; with light and dark, but I&apos;m not really convinced of that either.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Before the late 16th c. I don&apos;t think you can find much overt<br/>emotional<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; expression in music. And once the various forms of nontonal<br/>music are<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; reached in the 20th c, it doesn&apos;t seem to be about emotion any<br/>&gt; &gt;more either<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; (unless its all about &quot;anxiety&quot;, but that&apos;s not in the music-<br/>that&apos;s the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; listeners response to noise and/or the disorientation of not<br/>&gt; &gt;having a tonal<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; center and subsets of senarius partials (a.k.a. &quot;triads&quot;)<br/>&gt; &gt;flitting about.)<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; All the various 20th c &quot;dialects&quot; require at least some<br/>&gt; &gt;investment of time<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; before they can begin to be understood. In this way they are no<br/>different<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; than any other music, but with, say, the romantic period, you<br/>just had to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; learn one dialect and could then appreciate all (or most of) the<br/>music<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; being made, whereas in the 20th c. it is more the case that each<br/>composer<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; requires learning a new dialect, and you&apos;re not even sure if its<br/>worth it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; until you put in the time and effort, at which point you may<br/>decide it<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; wasn&apos;t. Its like learning a new language to see what people are<br/>talking<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; about in it, and then finding out they&apos;re just bullshitting or<br/>babbling.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; How much time do most people have to spend in this kind of<br/>exploration,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; besides musicians themselves and some few aficionados? For all<br/>us old<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; fogies who cant understand why hip hop has taken over music, im<br/>&gt; &gt;sure if we<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; spent enough time listening, finding out whos-who and immersing<br/>ourselves<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; in the culture, it would begin to make sense, but I for one<br/>&gt; &gt;don&apos;t have the<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; time or inclination. Most people don&apos;t have the time or<br/>&gt; &gt;inclination to put<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; in the effort necessary to begin to appreciate serial music, nor<br/>should<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; they- there&apos;s not that much return on the energy put in, when<br/>all is said<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; and done.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; We all know that often the response to microtonal music is that<br/>it sounds<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;out of tune&quot;, whereas to us 12edo sounds out of tune! It just<br/>depends on<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; what you&apos;re used to hearing, and the same goes for musical<br/>&gt; &gt;styles and what<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; the music is expressing, if anything, beyond the play of pitches<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; rhythms in time according to rules that are either personal or<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; cultural-consensus.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; Dante<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;-----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;From: Stevie Hryciw [<a href="mailto:codroid@y">mailto:codroid@y</a>...]<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Sent: Sunday, February 27, 2005 3:46 AM<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;To: <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Subject: [MMM] Re: new emotions<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kraig Grady<br/>&lt;kraiggrady@a...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;     We tend to view the romantic era as the great period of<br/>musical<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; emotional expression, yet as Bartok pointed out, the emotions<br/>to be<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; expressed were limited to a few and that only in the modern<br/>period<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; were composers free to explore others that had not been<br/>touched<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; upon. Whereas others composers saw the early 20th century as<br/>a turn<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; away from the emotions, he saw it as a further liberation.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  I agree with Bela. In the 20th century, composers almost let<br/>go of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;all the composing restrictions, and they became more fully able<br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;express themselves through harmony and structure not previously<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;acceptable.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  However, the Romantic period might always be remembered as<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the &quot;sweet spot&quot; of musical emotion because the music was<br/>generally<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;more expressive and emotional than in the Classical era, but<br/>non-<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;musicians could still relate to it. I unfortunately know few<br/>people,<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;if any, who enjoy 20th century &quot;neo-classical&quot; music, who aren&apos;t<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;musicians themselves. It&apos;s just not &quot;pretty&quot; to them, so it<br/>seems<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;cold rather than emotional.<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  Even I didn&apos;t like much 20th century until I heard Bartok. I<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;learned that if I don&apos;t like a certain music, it&apos;s only because<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;don&apos;t understand it.

Reminds me of things<br/>I&apos;ve pondered long and hard for many years.</p><p>What are things that people get out of music?  What is it that we<br/>humans experience in music that makes it so essential to our lives?<br/>Indeed different cultures make very different musics for very<br/>different reasons, yet I can think of no culture that is completely<br/>devoid of music of any form.  I&apos;ve often been fascinated by the<br/>extremely complex hierarchy of interpretations we Westerners have<br/>developed for our particular musics, as well as all the<br/>preconceptions about what is &quot;good taste&quot;.  Where does music really<br/>sit in our culture?  What is it capable of?  Is the concept<br/>of &quot;emotion&quot; as being distinct from &quot;thought&quot; even relevant in<br/>relation to music?</p><p>It&apos;s very strange to think about the various esthetics and thresholds<br/>that listeners apply to themselves...that there appears (to me,<br/>anyway) to be no consistency in even what people in our culture<br/>consider to be &quot;good music&quot;.  Even controlling factors of race,<br/>gender, location, and socio-economic background seems to only<br/>marginally narrow it down.  I think the notion of &quot;good taste&quot; is<br/>completely nonsensical, unless you use the word to express how<br/>similar a given person&apos;s preferences are to your own.</p><p>If this sounds off topic, let me try to bring it back home.  All of<br/>us here put an unusual amount of effort into understanding the<br/>principles of how music functions.  We&apos;ve all to some extent rejected<br/>the status quo (12-tet) in favor of something completely novel; we&apos;ve<br/>side-stepped cultural restraints and the boundaries of tradtion.<br/>Being that this is not a simple or easy task, we should all be asking<br/>ourselves two questions: &quot;What are we trying to accomplish, and why?&quot;</p><p>I am extraordinarily curious as to what is motivating all of us here,<br/>and I know that this seems like a basic (maybe even non-musical)<br/>question for which many of you might suggest that the answer is<br/>implicit, but I&apos;ve never seen this question asked and thought it time<br/>that it was.  Just so we can all remind ourselves of its answer.</p><p>Any thoughts?</p><p>-Igs</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dante Rosati&quot; &lt;dante@i...&gt;<br/>wrote:<br/>&gt; Hiya Kraig<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As to the Andean or other non european culture reaction to<br/>european<br/>&gt; &gt;music, i would say, it must have something that is almost<br/>immediately<br/>&gt; &gt;expressible , otherwise, western music and instruments would not<br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt;could not expand to such regions so easily. As someone who deals<br/>in much<br/>&gt; &gt;world music, I am sure that there are subtleties of expression<br/>that i<br/>&gt; &gt;miss, but i doubt that my reactions could be opposing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think you have to distinguish two different situations: the<br/>gradual introduction of western classical music into (for example)<br/>asian culture, eventually having kids there grow up hearing the<br/>stuff, and on the other hand taking an ipod into sumatra or the andes<br/>and playing beethoven to someone in a grass skirt and asking them<br/>what &quot;emotions&quot; it evokes. Anyone can learn into the western<br/>classical vernacular over time, but i dont think its inherent in the<br/>music itself. The andean dude may very well have some kind of<br/>reaction to the music, but that will say more about his mindset than<br/>it will about beethoven.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To turn the tables, when we hear something like gamelan music for<br/>the first time, it is no doubt evocative for us of many possible<br/>things, but i doubt any of them is what is experienced by a native<br/>balinese who grows up in that culture hearing that music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;    As for serialism expressing something beyond emotions, i<br/>question .<br/>&gt; &gt;and the idea that we must dismiss our &apos;subjective reaction to<br/>music in<br/>&gt; &gt;order to penetrate to what is beyond, rather absurd. Music is<br/>nothing<br/>&gt; &gt;but subjective and what exist &quot; objectively&quot; in music can be<br/>conveyed<br/>&gt; &gt;without the sound even happening. just looking at the score per<br/>se. In<br/>&gt; &gt;fact possibly turning it into sound exposes the very lack of<br/>&gt; &gt;understanding of the materials that are being used in the sense<br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt;what is perceived differs from what is the intent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not sure if you&apos;re commenting on something i said here, but I<br/>would agree that our subjective reaction to music is all there is.<br/>Groups of people can collectively agree to have similar reactions to<br/>certain musical gestures, but none of it is in the vibrations<br/>themselves. If you chant &quot;om&quot; in a low voice over a prolonged period,<br/>the vibrations and overtones will set up standing wave resonances in<br/>your system that I believe are beneficial to both body and mind, but<br/>beyond that I&apos;m not sure what, if any, other attributes of music can<br/>be assigned to the sounds themselves and not our cultural<br/>interpretations of them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dante</p></div><h3><a id=9175 href="#9175">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/27/2005 7:27:56 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Hello Steve!<br/>&gt; I find it interesting in that my own experience is the exact opposite<br/>&gt;on this one.

In fact it<br/>seems to<br/>&gt; me this is the actual goal. the availability of such emotional<br/>shading.<br/>&gt; But the problem is more complex for a variety of reasons.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     We tend to view the romantic era as the great period of musical<br/>&gt; emotional expression, yet as Bartok pointed out, the emotions to be<br/>&gt; expressed were limited to a few and that only in the modern period<br/>were<br/>&gt; composers free to explore others that had not been touched upon.<br/>Whereas<br/>&gt; others composers saw the early 20th century as a turn away from the<br/>&gt; emotions, he saw it as a further liberation.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     The problem, as i see it is that we could have a completely<br/>open<br/>&gt; array of possible choices, but more often than not , it is the<br/>actual<br/>&gt; pitch array, or we might say master scale that is responsible for<br/>the<br/>&gt; results Ivor Derrig is a good example, although not the first of<br/>the<br/>&gt; latter and the shuti system of India is a possible example of a<br/>system<br/>&gt; that combines both, self containment that allows  commatic<br/>fluctuations.</p><p>I thought it was quite appropriate that you mentioned Ivor Darreg,<br/>inasmuch as this discussion happened to remind me of his observation<br/>that different tunings tend to impart different &quot;moods&quot; to the same<br/>piece of music (or musical scale) by way of the varying melodic and<br/>harmonic properties that result from different amounts of tempering.<br/>I agree with those who have subsequently pointed out that more<br/>complex tunings are capable of allowing music in simpler tunings to<br/>be transferred to them in more than a single way, so that it would be<br/>misleading or simplistic to characterize JI, for example, as having<br/>a &quot;calmer&quot; mood than, say, 19-ET (which Ivor described as having<br/>more &quot;zonk&quot; or vitality).  When extended to a sufficient number of<br/>tones, JI allows a great range of consonance to dissonance, hence<br/>considerable range of &quot;mood&quot; (as the sruti system demonstrates).</p><p>However, I think Ivor began to realize this when he suggested that a<br/>tone one degree higher could be substituted for a leading tone in 31-<br/>ET to improve the melodic effect in certain instances (using the<br/>first measure of a Bach fugue as an example).  While it&apos;s debatable<br/>whether 31 has small enough increments of pitch for what most of us<br/>here would consider expressive intonation, it might very well come<br/>across that way to someone who&apos;s never ventured beyond 12.  Likewise,<br/>circulating unequal temperaments offer variations in intonation that<br/>allow &quot;mood&quot; to be varied according to one&apos;s selection of a tonic<br/>key, so it&apos;s not necessary to have many tones/octave to exploit this<br/>dimension of expressiveness.</p><p>But I would agree that true expressive intonation should allow one to<br/>make commatic distinctions, which would suggest a refinement of at<br/>least 41/octave, or better yet, 46 or 53, which allow more than one<br/>type of neutral third (9:11 vs. 13:16).</p><p>--George</p></div><h3><a id=9208 href="#9208">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/28/2005 3:03:33 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Oh my goodness Kraig!

Michael Shepard who put them out<br/>&gt; would take a small quanity at a time and they would store them at<br/>the<br/>&gt; factory until he came up with more money. It appears they were also<br/>&gt; printing porn DVD there and they owed the mob over a million<br/>dollars.<br/>&gt; they went in one day killed the owner execution style and proceeed<br/>to<br/>&gt; push over and destroy all the piles of CD and dvd still there. So<br/>only<br/>&gt; about 300- 400 made it out of the factory.
