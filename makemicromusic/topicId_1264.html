Have enjoyed it!</p><p>my pleasure...</p><p>&gt;I&apos;ve tried my hand at creating some piano samples based along<br/>these lines... It&apos;s the &quot;randomness&quot; of the attack transient portion of most acoustic timbres (not to mention noise components) which seems to be quite a<br/>beast to deal with in the realm of spectrally mapping familiar samples</p><p>yes, you need to map the partials, but also retain the &quot;noise&quot;<br/>components - they add a lot of the character to a sound -<br/>and when they are removed, everything becomes synthetic.</p><p>&gt;What I did was to crossfade/paste mix a new sustain stage with<br/>altered partials onto the end of the unaltered original piano<br/>attacks.</p><p>The danger here is that the moment of transition might (or might not)<br/>cause problems. The thing is that during the real attack, the partials<br/>are somewhat unsteady anyway, so the mapping doesnt need to be too<br/>exact - rather - it needs to &quot;end right&quot; so that the attack and the<br/>sustain can be nicely merged. One trick I found useful was to use<br/>an attack that was a tuiny bit longer than need be - then the<br/>attack ends with the partials in the right place to line up with the<br/>mapped partials in the sustain...</p><p>&gt;What would be nice is to create at least two samples - one soft and<br/>one bright, so that I could have a nice velocity cross-switching set-<br/>up for the sampler.</p><p>absolutely... though this just doubles the amount of work!</p><p>&gt; you can&apos;t stretch things too far from the original, and expect it to<br/>sound &quot;like&quot; the real thing (perhaps that was my &quot;problem&quot; with the<br/>above mentioned pianny).</p><p>this is part of the nature of the beast... but how far are you<br/>moving things? a few percent should be almost imperceptible<br/>(when heard alone), though motion of the partials by 25 percent<br/>is almost guaranteed to introduce weirdnesses... its much like pitch<br/>shifting algorithms - a few semitones is fone, but try to go a fifth<br/>and you&apos;ll notice...</p><p>&gt;But the very good news is that I can create spectrally mapped timbres<br/>all day long which are electronic - or invented -</p><p>additive synthesis can be great</p><p>&gt;I remember Mary mentioning a while back that she has some Mac<br/>software that&apos;ll let one adjust the entire timbre of instruments</p><p>Metasynth is a cool program, though I still havent mastered it yet.</p><p>&gt; Another way far out dream<br/>is my wish for the day when computing and software power is such that<br/>timbre and tuning *both* can be changed on the fly, and at the<br/>composer&apos;s whim and will.</p><p>Im with you there... I&apos;ll buy one!</p><p>Bill Sethares</p></div>
