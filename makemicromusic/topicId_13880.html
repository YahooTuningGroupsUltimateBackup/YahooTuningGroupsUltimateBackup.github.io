It goes on for about 5 minutes, which I think is about<br/>the limit (or maybe just past?) for the static timbre and rhythm to<br/>remain interesting.  I was wondering, could you not apply the same<br/>sort of process to vary the rhythm, maybe even the timbre?  Also you<br/>could experiment with juxtaposing different sections of different<br/>rhythmic ratios.</p><p>It feels very meditative to me (which is a compliment in my book ;) )</p><p>&gt;  Well done, Dave. I&apos;ve been thinking about breaking into composition<br/>&gt;  with something like Csound. I looked at the links to both Csound and<br/>&gt;  Blue, but I&apos;m a bit bewildered at all the different file options. I<br/>&gt;  have Windows XP...what files would a rank beginner like myself need<br/>&gt;  to download to begin experiments with Blue and Csound? (The less<br/>&gt;  command line input, the better. I really, really, really would<br/>&gt;  prefer a GUI interface, if possible.)</p><p>Csound itself is all command-line, but if blue is set up properly you<br/>won&apos;t need to see any of it (except to debug errors in your code).<br/>Also, the microtonal piano rolls in blue are completely awesome.<br/>Theoretically, the only typing you still need to do is in the<br/>instrument-building.  IMO it&apos;s worth it though, as it&apos;s still easier<br/>(for me at least) than breaking out the saw and chisels to make a<br/>marimba :-D</p><p>Chris</p></div><h3>Dave Seidel &#x3C;dave@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/3/2006 4:31:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Chris.  I agree, five minutes is a good limit for this sort of thing.  I&apos;m likely to do something else eventually that would explore different aspects of this material, so we&apos;ll see.</p><p>Glad you find it meditative, especially since that&apos;s a quality I strive for in almost every piece I make.</p><p>- Dave</p><p>c.m.bryan wrote:<br/>&gt; Dave,<br/>&gt; &gt; Nice piece.
