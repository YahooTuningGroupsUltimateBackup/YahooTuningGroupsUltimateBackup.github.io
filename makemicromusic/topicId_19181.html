I don&apos;t care what you think, because my<br/>&gt;&gt; ego has dissolved and merged with the One. Just listen as you would<br/>&gt;&gt; listen to the rain or the wind. Does the rain or the wind desire your<br/>&gt;&gt; applause? Will it entertain your feeble suggestions of what software,<br/>&gt;&gt; hardware, sample banks or techniques to use? I have become both water<br/>&gt;&gt; and wind--I&apos;ve moved beyond pleasure and pain, praise and critique,<br/>&gt;&gt; and am just living in the &apos;zone&apos;, 24/7---man, I&apos;m a Zen master by now,<br/>&gt;&gt; looking down from the mountain and laughing, and then carrying my<br/>&gt;&gt; water buckets a ways and returning to the village. And then ------<br/>&gt;&gt; silence.</p><p>&gt;I got a big laugh out of this, Aaron, and repeated it almost verbatim<br/>&gt;to my wife. Maybe I&apos;ll memorize it for personal use.</p><p>:)I&apos;d love to sit here and chat with you but I&apos;ve got to clean my rice<br/>bowls and beat my students with sticks when they don&apos;t &quot;get&quot; the<br/>Buddha nature of a dog, or the sound of one hand clapping....I tell<br/>them &apos;Mu&apos;, but they don&apos;t listen, the brats! Students of Zazen ain&apos;t<br/>what they used to be, let&apos;s face it.</p><p>Remember, the stiff branch breaks, while the soft branch yields and<br/>survives, and the highest good is like water....it flows where men do<br/>not go, etc., etc.</p><p>-AKJ</p></div>
