He introduced the Twining piece with an explanation<br/>that the piece would feature the 9th and 11th harmonics (yes it was a<br/>tribute to 9/11) and if he played any notes that seemed to be out of<br/>tune, trust him, they&apos;re not.</p><p>Overall, a good show.  I&apos;d never heard of him before, but his talent<br/>is obvious, his skills top-notch.</p><p>Paolo</p></div>
