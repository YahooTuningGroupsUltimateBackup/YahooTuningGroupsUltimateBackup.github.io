Here&apos;s a message from Don Harris, Ohio<br/>State U.:</p><p>&gt;&gt;  &gt;Last night, while traveling from Chicago to Columbus, Lou<br/>Harrison &gt;&gt;  &gt;passed away.  We had sent Adam Schweigert and Joe<br/>Panzner, two &gt;&gt;  &gt;students in Composition and Theory, to Chicago with<br/>a University van &gt;&gt;  &gt;to greet Lou and his traveling companion, Todd<br/>Burlingame, and drive &gt;&gt;  &gt;them back to campus for the Festival.  Lou<br/>does not like to fly and &gt;&gt;  &gt;took the train, the California Zephyr,<br/>from near San Francisco to &gt;&gt;  &gt;Chicago.  The train arrived at about<br/>5:15 PM.  While en route to &gt;&gt;  &gt;Indianapolis, their overnight<br/>destination, Adam, Joe, Lou and Todd &gt;&gt;  &gt;decided to stop at a<br/>Denny&apos;s restaurant in Lafayette, Indiana, for &gt;&gt;  &gt;some dinner.  Lou<br/>stumbled and fell upon getting out of the vehicle &gt;&gt;  &gt;and apparently<br/>suffered a heart attack.  He had great difficulty &gt;&gt;  &gt;breathing.<br/>Paramedics were called and they arrived within minutes. &gt;&gt;  &gt;Lou was<br/>transported to the hospital but was unable to be revived. &gt;&gt;  &gt;He<br/>passed away around 9 or 9:30 PM.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  &gt;This is a great tragedy for the entire world of music.  Lou was<br/>as &gt;&gt;  &gt;excited about the Festival as we were.  Our sympathies go out<br/>to all &gt;&gt;  &gt;in the world of music and dance who treasured his great<br/>gift.   I &gt;&gt;  &gt;will always remember the joy in his voice when we<br/>spoke over the &gt;&gt;  &gt;telephone about the Festival.  He was an active<br/>participant in &gt;&gt;  &gt;planning the concerts.  He had also prepared a<br/>special seminar for &gt;&gt;  &gt;OSU students in composition.  He was very<br/>much looking forward to &gt;&gt;  &gt;the CSO performances of his Third<br/>Symphony in a final revision that &gt;&gt;  &gt;he had just completed.  He<br/>told me how honored he felt to have so &gt;&gt;  &gt;many of his compositions<br/>performed on the Festival.  Let everyone &gt;&gt;  &gt;know that the Festival<br/>performances will go on as planned as a &gt;&gt;  &gt;tribute to this<br/>legendary American musician.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  &gt;I must also at this time offer our sincere thanks to Adam and<br/>Joe. &gt;&gt;  &gt;As you might imagine, they were devastated by what took<br/>place.   Yet &gt;&gt;  &gt;they remained calm at all times, stayed in close<br/>touch with me, and &gt;&gt;  &gt;were of great comfort to Todd Burlingame.  We<br/>can be proud of the &gt;&gt;  &gt;way they represented Ohio State and the<br/>School of Music.  Adam and &gt;&gt;  &gt;Joe will return to Columbus today.<br/>When you see them, please thank &gt;&gt;  &gt;them for their calm and measured<br/>reactions under such tragic &gt;&gt;  &gt;circumstances.</p><p>&gt;&gt;  &gt;Lou Harrison will be cremated today; his remains shipped back to<br/>&gt;&gt;  &gt;California.   He was eighty-five years old.<br/>------- End of forwarded message -------</p></div><h3>Jonathan M.

A gentler soul and more adventurous spirit one could not find than Lou. My colleague Randy reminded me that it was a year ago to the day that Lou passed that we shared a stage with him in San Jose, in tribute to Harry Partch.</p><p>I bet the two of them are retuning all the harps in the afterworld right now...</p><p>Best,<br/>Jon</p></div>
