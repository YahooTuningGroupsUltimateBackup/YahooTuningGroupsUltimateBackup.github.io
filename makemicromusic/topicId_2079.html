As a daddy myself, I can relate to a lot<br/>of<br/>&gt; your feelings here, although my girls are only 3-1/2 and 22 months<br/>&gt; and not quite at an age to be real musically expressive.  I&apos;ve been<br/>&gt; VERY gently encouraging them to play with a few instruments, and<br/>it&apos;s<br/>&gt; a joy to watch and listen to.  (Although sometimes painful when all<br/>&gt; they want to do is randomly pound...)  I wish I had a recorder going<br/>&gt; when I recently showed Lydia how to sing into a microphone with a<br/>&gt; digital delay.  She talked, giggled, screamed into the mic and<br/>stared<br/>&gt; in thrilled amazement every time it looped back around.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m edging closer to completing a simple &quot;golden meantone<br/>pentatonic&quot;<br/>&gt; tubulong as a gift for Lydia.  (It was originally supposed to be a<br/>&gt; Christmas present, but there&apos;s only just so much time in a day to<br/>&gt; work on it...)  We&apos;ll see how much interest she takes in playing it<br/>&gt; once it is ready.  I know, too, sometimes these things sit dormant<br/>&gt; for years before the interest suddenly awakens...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I will try to resist the temptation to post an mp3 of Lydia singing<br/>&gt; &quot;The Itsy Bitsy Spider&quot;.  Well, it certainly is microtonal!  Maybe<br/>we<br/>&gt; need another spinoff list, tuning_parenting...<br/>&gt; kp<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Yahoo!
