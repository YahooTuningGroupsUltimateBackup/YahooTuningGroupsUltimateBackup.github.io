I believe he is referring to the<br/>Nord_ModularG2 Yahoo Group.  His patch probably cannot bypass the G2<br/>editor&apos;s inability to import tuning files, but it seems like a<br/>reasonable stopgap solution.  Here&apos;s the relevant content of his<br/>email:</p><p>&quot;I uploaded a patch to the ModularG2 group<br/>that implements individual tuning in cents for each key, for 64 keys<br/>in the middle of the MIDI range, with the 8 most common scales preset<br/>in the Variations: Pure major, pure minor, Mean tone, Pythagorean,<br/>Werckmeister, Kirnberger, Valotti&amp;Young and Equal temperament. Just<br/>play a chord and switch between them to compare.</p><p>Each scale can be transposed to any key with a knob.</p><p>It could easily be expanded to all 128 MIDI keys in the same way.</p><p>The patch uses a simple sound, just as a demo, men you can easily use<br/>it for any kind of oscillators and synthesis techniques. Read the<br/>comments in the text file attached to the patch.</p><p>It is also possible to make an octave-wise microtuning, that repeats<br/>for every octave, but I don&apos;t have the time for that right now. If<br/>you<br/>are really interested, I may quickly throw that together at some<br/>later<br/>point.</p><p>Happy playing,</p><p>Palle Dahlstedt&quot;</p></div>
