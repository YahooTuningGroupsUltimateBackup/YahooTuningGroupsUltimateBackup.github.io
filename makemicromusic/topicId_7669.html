It even has<br/>an option to realise a midi sound directly to waveform<br/>audio.</p><p>Here is a page about quicktime using the Roland Sound Canvas</p><p><a href="http://news.harmony-central.com/Newp/1997/Roland-QuickTime.html">http://news.harmony-central.com/Newp/1997/Roland-QuickTime.html</a></p><p>Here is where you can download it:<br/><a href="http://www.edirol.it/europe/downloads.asp?id=12&la=UK&gid=3">http://www.edirol.it/europe/downloads.asp?id=12&la=UK&gid=3</a></p><p>Go to Demo then right to the bottom of the page.</p><p>The Roland Sound Canvas is commercial software<br/>so you pay for it but the cost isn&apos;t high<br/>and you can get a download trial first.<br/>So you can do work during the 30 day trial period<br/>and find out what one thinks of it and if it is<br/>suitable for ones needs.</p><p>If one wants to use Quicktime rather than the Roland<br/>then you can save the piece to a midi file and then play the midi<br/>file in a web page using the quicktime plug in.<br/>That works well. Though the quicktime plug in is<br/>also rather eccentric in its treatment of pitch bends<br/>- whatever pitch bend range you actually specify in<br/>the midi file, it will transform them all into its<br/>&quot;fractional semitones&quot; pitch bends before<br/>it plays them, which have a much wider range<br/>- can&apos;t remember  the details now, a few octaves,<br/>so you will also lose just a bit of pitch bend resolution.</p><p>I also know of a way to play directly through quicktime<br/>and FTS supports that - but I can&apos;t get it to work<br/>very well in real time on the p.c, and don&apos;t happen to<br/>know of any other P.c. program you can get that<br/>lets you play directly in Quicktime in real time<br/>apart from FTS.</p><p>Even the demo code that I got from Quicktime<br/>to show how to program it to play in real time<br/>had the same problem. The timing of the notes is<br/>quite irregular when played in real time over the<br/>quicktime synth. It&apos;s like latency but the latency<br/>is irregular rather than constant, which makes<br/>fast passages and crisp chords impossible.</p><p>It&apos;s quite probable that there is some techy detail<br/>I&apos;m missing in their code, and that there is a<br/>way to get it to work. But anyway I don&apos;t know<br/>of any other program you can use to do it either<br/>and Quicktime itself doesn&apos;t have an option to play<br/>it in real time on a P.c.</p><p>When the midi file gets played in quicktime in a<br/>web page it can schedule the notes slightly<br/>in advance so that will avoid that issue.</p><p>The roland soft synth has no such problems of irregular<br/>timings - it has slight latency, but it is constant<br/>rather than irregular, as normal for a soft synth<br/>so everything is nicely in time and chords are crisp<br/>- like playing a church organ.</p><p>On a very fast machine you probably won&apos;t even notice<br/>it unless able to feel millisecond type<br/>latency, in which case one might notice it.</p><p>As it is a GS sound set you get many<br/>extra instruments and sound<br/>sets when you vary the bank number.</p><p>Robert</p><p>----- Original Message -----<br/>From: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>To: &lt;<a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>Sent: Wednesday, September 29, 2004 8:54 PM<br/>Subject: [MMM] Digest Number 993</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; There are 17 messages in this issue.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Topics in this digest:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       1. mp3 and ogg on the same page<br/>&gt;            From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@...&gt;<br/>&gt;       2.

Our programs are roughly similar in transmissino<br/>&gt; rates.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s probably going to be less than the maximum transmission<br/>&gt; rate to send a note on along the midi cable (one note<br/>&gt; per millisecond) - unless you have very fast usb midi or a<br/>&gt; very slow computer.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But that&apos;s not so bad - after all 1ms is a thousandth<br/>&gt; of a second which is pretty small -  if you play two notes on a piano<br/>&gt; a meter apart then if they are in sync for a listener<br/>&gt; to one side then they will be out of sync for a<br/>&gt; listener in front of the keyboard by 3 ms, or vice<br/>&gt; versa. Though I know that if you mix the notes over<br/>&gt; headphones or can position the microphone precisely<br/>&gt; to within inches and get the performer to perform<br/>&gt; for a listener at that exact location in space then<br/>&gt; you could get a better synchronisation than<br/>&gt; this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It is possible to do better though. I did a<br/>&gt; program that was very bare bones retuning app<br/>&gt; which had better transmission rates. If you<br/>&gt; notice anything more than a ms or so per note<br/>&gt; then it would be a bug of some type and<br/>&gt; I&apos;d want to know about it and fix it.<br/>&gt; You can get FTS to check the latency<br/>&gt; of other programs or indeed itself to<br/>&gt; find out where the delay is happening<br/>&gt; - by relaying the notes via Midi Relay<br/>&gt; which has a fast transmission rate of<br/>&gt; 0.15 ms per note on here - that would<br/>&gt; vary on your computer speed - for<br/>&gt; each midi relay in the chain. So by<br/>&gt; subtracting that known amount and doing<br/>&gt; it for a bunch of e.g. 10 notes you can<br/>&gt; find out how much latency is due to<br/>&gt; FTS or Scala, like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; FTS Synchronisation tester -&gt; Midi Relay<br/>&gt; -&gt; Program to test -&gt; Midi Relay -&gt; FTS<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - two uses of midi relay adding up to<br/>&gt; 0.3 ms - then the relay through the<br/>&gt; program to test so subtract 0.3 ms from<br/>&gt; the result and you find out how much it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway I&apos;ll be interested to know what you<br/>&gt; reckon actually trying out FTS - maybe I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; improved the latency a bit from before.<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve done work on it certainly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 6<br/>&gt;    Date: Wed, 29 Sep 2004 01:21:52 +0100<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: Essential Reality P5 glove<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hi Andy,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That might work. Check out &quot;absolute mode&quot; on the P5 group. That&apos;s<br/>&gt; &gt; what will need to be used. Don&apos;t use the Essential Reality SDK for<br/>&gt; &gt; absolute mode, though. It says it works in the SDK docs but it<br/>&gt; &gt; really doesn&apos;t. Only relative mode works (similar to mouse input).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rightio, thanks. Though I&apos;m not sure I understand the distinction between<br/>&gt; relative and absolute mode here yet. With the mouse, you can lift the mouse<br/>&gt; off the pad and place it back again somewhere else, so you lose<br/>&gt; the record of where it was before, so it has to be relative.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I don&apos;t yet understand how you can you lose the absolute position of<br/>&gt; the glove as it seems there is nowhere else to move it to. Must be<br/>&gt; missing something there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As I&apos;m thinking more on this, you probably wouldn&apos;t want to limit it<br/>&gt; &gt; to just a single flat surface. You could stack virtual surfaces and<br/>&gt; &gt; just play in the air since it&apos;s all on screen. That would be cool!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, it would be great! I can think of many possibilities here<br/>&gt; such as lattices, 3D theremin, split keys etc.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As far as languages go, I use C++ due to it&apos;s massive use in the SDKs<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m linked to. I like the purity of C but love the reusability /<br/>&gt; &gt; encapsulation of C++! It fits my programming style really well, too,<br/>&gt; &gt; but that might be because it&apos;s what I&apos;ve groaned used to.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I can understand that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, you can do most of the basic SDK stuff using C only,<br/>&gt; but one or two things require C++ - the main thing I use<br/>&gt; it for is making desktop shortcuts, for some reason not<br/>&gt; supported in pure C in the SDK. Some other things can<br/>&gt; be done in C but are far more complex, e.g. tool tips.<br/>&gt; I do those in pure C but that part of my programs<br/>&gt; took me a fair number of weeks to write and debug<br/>&gt; before I had it all figured out!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Who knows, maybe if tings had gone differently at some poitn in the past<br/>&gt; I too might have got used to C++ and come to prefer<br/>&gt; coding in it too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 7<br/>&gt;    Date: Tue, 28 Sep 2004 20:06:25 -0700<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Jonathan M.

You certainly took a different angle than I thought of:<br/>&gt; instead of files with (roughly) equivalent fidelity but differing lengths,<br/>&gt; you offer complete movements (pieces) by utilizing differing factors of<br/>&gt; compression, as you so aptly put &quot;lo-fi&quot; and &quot;hi-fi&quot;. Not a comparison of<br/>&gt; the codecs, but that isn&apos;t what you intended anyhow.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I listened to the 3rd movement of the Haydn and - no surprise - the ogg<br/>&gt; (hi-fi) version sounds much better, having better frequency range.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I *would* suggest that you lay it out a little more tabular, as the<br/>&gt; lo/hi-fi selections bump right up against one another, and may not be<br/>&gt; totally intuitive. If nothing else, put some space in there (even a<br/>&gt; blank.gif with a width of something uniform).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And then there is the &quot;I suggest just listening to the music without<br/>&gt; fussing about &quot;correct&quot; soundfonts&quot;... This suggests that music is nothing<br/>&gt; more than pitches and notes of varying lengths and volumes, as if composers<br/>&gt; never really cared about what timbral resource might be utilized. I<br/>&gt; understand your point, and we have never seen eye-to-eye (or<br/>&gt; eye-to-anything, for that matter :).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But since some recent discussions around here have toyed with the<br/>&gt; philosophy that the rendered/recorded sounds utilized in a lot of our<br/>&gt; electronic microtonal stuff has a lot to do with it&apos;s semi-lameness, I can<br/>&gt; only offer this: one of the things that good composers things about is<br/>&gt; *everything*. I realize that there are areas of music where performance can<br/>&gt; vary a lot in terms of instrumental/vocal resources (and I&apos;m *specifically*<br/>&gt; not referring to _transcriptions_), but a composition is the sum of its<br/>&gt; parts, and the scoring of the piece - the way that it becomes sound from<br/>&gt; dots on a page, etc - can be just as important as the rhythms and pitches.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can only speak for myself: I experience music holistically. I listen as<br/>&gt; much to the phrasing, to the &apos;orchestration&apos; (if you will), to the mix (in<br/>&gt; recorded situations), as much as I do to melody, harmony, and rhythm. How<br/>&gt; could one not? (strictly rhetorical)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; All of that _said_, I didn&apos;t find the soundfont objectionable, and it was<br/>&gt; at least as good as most &apos;arco&apos; string sounds that you find on good synths<br/>&gt; or samplers. However, even if one leaves out real string playing, there is<br/>&gt; a huge world of music that can be made with string sample libraries, but it<br/>&gt; requires one to use many kinds of samples and to really understand the<br/>&gt; phrasing of a string player as exhibited in the writing of the piece. I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; heard very, very effective mock-ups of works using samplers, but it<br/>&gt; requires a lot of work to get the sound right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Going back, you might look at the html layout of a couple of the music<br/>&gt; sites (like zebox, soundclick, etc) for how they spreadout the various<br/>&gt; sound file formats for downloading/streaming, to make your page more clear...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Cheers,<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 8<br/>&gt;    Date: Wed, 29 Sep 2004 06:05:11 -0000<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@...&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: mp3 and ogg on the same page<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jonathan M.

He didn&apos;t. In any case, if you<br/>&gt; want to complain about a lack of authenticity, it seems to be<br/>&gt; considered acceptable to butcher the tuning, even when an orchestra as<br/>&gt; excellent as the BPO is playing. Why is the BPO playing in 12 equal<br/>&gt; with A set high and with inflated resources acceptable, but using the<br/>&gt; &quot;wrong&quot; soundfont isn&apos;t? This suggests music has nothing much to do<br/>&gt; with pitches, and that heavy-handed big band sounds are just peachy<br/>&gt; for this kind of music. Why is that better than using arco strings?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; understand your point, and we have never seen eye-to-eye (or<br/>&gt; &gt; eye-to-anything, for that matter :).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But I&apos;ve never really understood yours. You seem to think the arco<br/>&gt; strings work for this piece, but are suggesting they shouldn&apos;t be used<br/>&gt; anyway--or something.

How<br/>&gt; &gt; could one not? (strictly rhetorical)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; How much does tuning matter, in this view? How significant is the idea<br/>&gt; content of the music? Obviously listening to Beethoven&apos;s late quartets<br/>&gt; and playing attention only to how good the string playing is misses<br/>&gt; most of the point. Schnabel was not a technically brilliant pianist,<br/>&gt; but people still listen and learn from his pioneering recordings,<br/>&gt; because so much of Beethoven is about *ideas*. Where do ideas fit in?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, even if one leaves out real string playing, there is<br/>&gt; &gt; a huge world of music that can be made with string sample libraries,<br/>&gt; but it<br/>&gt; &gt; requires one to use many kinds of samples and to really understand the<br/>&gt; &gt; phrasing of a string player as exhibited in the writing of the<br/>&gt; piece. I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; heard very, very effective mock-ups of works using samplers, but it<br/>&gt; &gt; requires a lot of work to get the sound right.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It sounds like something which would make a great course--how to<br/>&gt; produce a Hollywood mock-up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 9<br/>&gt;    Date: Tue, 28 Sep 2004 23:21:29 -0700<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Jonathan M.

I said that the soundfont didn&apos;t bother me<br/>&gt; too much, and that is because it is a decent emulation of an arco string<br/>&gt; note, with a fair amount of bow attack. I didn&apos;t say anything about *not*<br/>&gt; using them - if you read carefully, you&apos;ll note that I mention that<br/>&gt; successful use of samples in emulating an complex instrument (in this case,<br/>&gt; and most notably, string articulations) requires not one kind of sample but<br/>&gt; many. The variety of attack envelopes and nuances in the phrasing of a bow<br/>&gt; are numerous and have a great degree of impact on how that phrasing creates<br/>&gt; a musical line. All one need do is take a look at the score, or even<br/>&gt; better, study a string player performing such a part, to see that one kind<br/>&gt; of sample will not give an effective rendition of a well composed line.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Where do ideas fit in?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Obviously, they are also part of the whole.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;It sounds like something which would make a great course--how to produce a<br/>&gt; &gt;Hollywood mock-up.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There have only been two string quartets that went by the name of the<br/>&gt; Hollywood String Quartet.

One other thing<br/>&gt; to throw into the mix is the inhumane time compression of the scoring<br/>&gt; environment, which these days practically dictates a team approach.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll cut out, as we&apos;re probably way OT at this point...<br/>&gt; Jon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; ________________________________________________________________________<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Message: 17<br/>&gt;    Date: Wed, 29 Sep 2004 08:09:01 -0700<br/>&gt;    From: &quot;Jonathan M.
