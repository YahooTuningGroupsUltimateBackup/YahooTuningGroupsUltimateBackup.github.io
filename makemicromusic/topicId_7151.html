My feeling is that perhaps<br/>not the complete archive as it<br/>has so much in the eway of ephemeral<br/>posts about pieces uploaded that<br/>are work in progress and<br/>that then get removed.<br/>They seem of more immediate<br/>interest rather than archive<br/>type material.</p><p>However, maybe it might be<br/>useful to do an opt in archive<br/>for the last month of posts?</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7152 href="#7152">ðŸ”—</a>Jonathan M.
