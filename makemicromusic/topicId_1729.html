Oh my gosh, your<br/>computer walked right into that one.</p><p>Jon was very perceptive in the movement of my eyebrows. I&apos;m kind of a 13 nut,<br/>as 26 is my number. I have made a few scales that did not have a 20/17, but<br/>looked quite similiar to Jacky&apos;s measurements. Just looking at his findings you<br/>can hear it&apos;s juicy texture. One hears the 13/10 a fair amount in Mayan music<br/>as well.</p><p>Happy Old Years!</p><p>George</p><p>&quot;Jonathan M.
