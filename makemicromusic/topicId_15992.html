Because wider stretches<br/>are required, it is slightly awkward, but feasible.</p><p>Though I started this piece at the keyboard with TBX1, I ended up writing most of it<br/>directly into the computer (Overture notation software for Mac OSX) controlling TBX1<br/>through a MIDI interface because I don&apos;t yet have an 88 key controller.</p><p>It would be possible to play the Rondo on a Tonal Plexus, but I feel it&apos;s less appropriate. I<br/>use the Plexus for just intonation, where access to any pitch is required, and a standard<br/>keyboard can&apos;t possibly cope with the demands of the music. The Plexus is also great for<br/>seeing where pitches of any tuning fall within the octave. But with a fixed ET, I feel a<br/>regular keyboard is more appropriate for performance.</p><p>So at the risk of having all my posts just sound like ads for my stuff, in response to the<br/>remark</p><p>&quot;This would be a lot easier if I had a<br/>&gt; microtonal keyboard controller...&quot;</p><p>I have to say that I&apos;m finding it is really easy to write music in whatever ETs using a regular<br/>keyboard, regular notation software and a Tuning Box. I&apos;ve been waiting a long time to<br/>compose in other ETs because it always just seemed like way too much work to try and<br/>figure out how the heck to do it. Basically, I wanted it to be as easy as writing music in<br/>12ET, with all the benefits of using notation software. So I designed the Tuning Box to do<br/>just that. Now that it is a reality I am having a total blast finally writing some music.<br/>Writing in whatever tuning is the same process as normal composition only with the added<br/>steps of connecting a few cables and pressing a button. I can play around and get an idea<br/>by ear, write it down and work with it, go to the computer and notate it, listen, transpose,<br/>choose different sounds, and just have fun and get it done.</p><p>I guess anyone who has a synth capable of uploading full range tunings from Scala has<br/>been able to do basically the same thing, only not as easily? I don&apos;t own any synths<br/>especially equipped for microtones beyond 12 note scales, so I can&apos;t compare the<br/>experiences.</p><p>n.b. While 19 starts to become awkward, 17ET is more managable and as you know has<br/>lots of possibilities!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Aaron Hunt</p><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jacob&quot; &lt;jbarton@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Aaron Andrew Hunt &lt;aahunt@&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html">http://www.h-pi.com/downloads.html</a><br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &quot;Rondo in 19ET&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hey Aaron,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your rate of completion of music is an argument in overwhelming<br/>&gt; support of the sentiment, &quot;This would be a lot easier if I had a<br/>&gt; microtonal keyboard controller...&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Is this Rondo feasibly performable on the Tonal Plexus or<br/>&gt; retuned-normal keyboard?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; respectfully,<br/>&gt; jacob<br/>&gt;</p></div><h3><a id=16012 href="#16012">ðŸ”—</a>Aaron Andrew Hunt &#x3C;aahunt@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/12/2007 9:27:42 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Thanks, Carl.

But the staff notation is limited to 12-ET, and is pretty much useless for simulating natural variations in rhythm or phrasing. You can edit the MIDI events directly in the Event List, which gives you the ultimate in precision, but unless I&apos;m entering a precise, complex rhythm or modifying individual pitch bends, I rarely use it. Considering the alternatives, piano roll isn&apos;t so bad. (Maybe when the Thummer is commercially available I won&apos;t need to use the piano roll so much.)</p></div><h3><a id=16065 href="#16065">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/13/2007 9:02:29 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Herman Miller &lt;hmiller@...&gt;<br/>wrote:</p><p>&gt; Cakewalk pretty much has four ways of getting notes in: direct MIDI<br/>&gt; input, piano roll, the MIDI event list, and staff notation.

Here&apos;s the method i<br/>used to use for microtonal music:</p><p>1) enter the closest 12-edo note on either the Staff view<br/>or Piano-roll view;</p><p>2) enter another very low or very high note along with<br/>each of the &quot;real&quot; notes, i.e., making each one a 2-note<br/>chord; it was useful for me to keep this second &quot;note&quot;<br/>at the same very high or very low pitch to make it easy<br/>to find and edit later in the Event List view;</p><p>3) go into Event List view, change the tick value of each<br/>of those very high or very low notes by one tick less<br/>(so that it will precede each actual Note-on by one tick)<br/>by pressing the &quot;minus&quot; key on the keyboard numbered keypad,<br/>then change each MIDI message from &quot;Note-on&quot; to &quot;Pitch bend&quot;.</p><p>Of course, it was always necessary to have a table handy<br/>which listed all the necessary pitch-bend values. And it<br/>was tedious to do things this way too, but at least it worked.</p><p>I also wrote <a href="http://micro.cal">micro.cal</a>, a small Cakewalk Application Language<br/>(i.e., &quot;CAL&quot;) program to make it easier to enter JI pitches<br/>into Cakewalk:</p><p><a href="http://www.sonic-arts.org/monzo/micro/micro.htm">http://www.sonic-arts.org/monzo/micro/micro.htm</a></p><p>It uses Ellis&apos;s (of Helmholtz fame) augmented bimodulus<br/>method of calculating cents to come within 2 cents accuracy<br/>of any JI pitch. You simply enter the ratio of the note<br/>you want and <a href="http://micro.cal">micro.cal</a> pops it into your Cakewalk score.</p><p>The version of Cakewalk which i used forever was 9.03<br/>... from what i&apos;ve read it seems that the newer Cakewalk<br/>products no longer support CAL.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://tonalsoft.com">http://tonalsoft.com</a><br/>Tonescape microtonal music software</p></div><h3><a id=16070 href="#16070">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;genewardsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/14/2007 4:47:06 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com">MakeMicroMusic@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jon Szanto &lt;jszanto@...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; I specifically recommended Home Studio for you to try at one time, to<br/>incorporate some of the soft synths.

And no, we<br/>don&apos;t have that yet, and i can&apos;t say how soon we will.</p><p>But i do want to emphasize how nice composing a microtonal<br/>piece with a piano-roll-style window is, when the &quot;piano roll&quot;<br/>is quantized to visually reflect the size of the spaces<br/>between notes, especially when it&apos;s an unevenly-spaced<br/>tuning or scale.</p><p>I&apos;ve been doing serious work lately on creating .tonescape<br/>files of symphonic works from the standard repertoire,<br/>tuned in a 31-tone chain of 1/6-comma meantone, and<br/>i&apos;ll tell you, it&apos;s lovely to be able within about<br/>10 minutes or so, to get used to exactly where the notes<br/>of such a large tuning fall on the Pitch-Height notation,<br/>because of the uneven spacing.

It&apos;s not something you can control from a text file; you still have a GUI to deal with. The event list is just a table with each event on a row, and a toolbar for commonly used commands like &quot;insert event&quot; and &quot;delete event&quot;. You can paste pitch bend numbers directly into it, though, if that helps.</p></div>
