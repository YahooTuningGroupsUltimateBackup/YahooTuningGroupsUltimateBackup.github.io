 :)</p><p>thanks for that criticism, Joe.</p><p>in fact, this piece as you&apos;re hearing it was basically finished<br/>on September 28, when its topicality was a lot more relevant<br/>(it&apos;s about 9-11, as well as ancient Rome).  the reason it&apos;s<br/>only appearing now, 5 months later, is because i haven&apos;t had<br/>the tools and/or time to give it the production it deserves.</p><p>and i&apos;ve approached a couple of colleagues here whose work in<br/>the studio i respect in the utmost, and they too were all unable<br/>to help out at this time.</p><p>so i was anxious to get this before all of you, and kind of<br/>slapped together something that sounded at least good enough<br/>that i&apos;d finally be willing to make it public, because i<br/>really wanted people to hear this, and i really am interested<br/>in their feedback.</p><p>the part that sounds the worst to me, production-wise, is<br/>after the part in changing meters, right where it goes into<br/>the full-blown version of the hard-rock section for the first<br/>time.  there&apos;s some clipping there that i don&apos;t think i can<br/>digitally remove -- it would require recording it over again.</p><p>but then, after listening to the mp3 for a while, i actually<br/>liked that clipping more and more, because to me it really<br/>evokes the sound of explosions that happened at the<br/>World Trade Center on 9-11.</p><p>since folks on this list frequently seem to be interested<br/>in the actual genesis of a composition, i&apos;ll describe in<br/>some detail how _Cruisin&apos; thru the Ruins_ came about;<br/>and i think it has quite a bearing on this &quot;poorly engineered&quot;<br/>version.</p><p>the part in changing meters, which i wrote about 5 days<br/>after returning home from my trip to Europe, is supposed<br/>to be &quot;about&quot; the trip ... depicting me traveling around<br/>Paris, Bruges, Rome, Florence, Venice, Brussels, Amsterdam,<br/>etc.</p><p>the hard-rock section, which was written just before i left,<br/>was not &quot;about&quot; anything when i wrote it.  i was just inspired<br/>with what i thought was a really cool riff, and when i put<br/>it into the computer and added other stuff to it, it changed<br/>and developed in quite beautiful and unexpected ways ...</p><p>[digression ...]</p><p>... as almost always happens when i compose -- even when i think<br/>the *original* inspiration is very good (which i admit is not<br/>always the case), it frequently happens that in the process<br/>of working on the piece all kinds of new connections and<br/>other ideas become apparent, as if they are an inherent part<br/>of the original musical idea in some strange way.  a great<br/>example of this in my own work is _A Noiseless Patient Spider_<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/spider/spider.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/spider/spider.htm</a><br/>see the program notes there for details.</p><p>it&apos;s no big deal that this happens to me -- very many people<br/>have made similar comments.  Jim Morrison (of The Doors)<br/>said about composing the first Doors album: &quot;it was like<br/>there was this fantastic rock concert going on in my head,<br/>an i was just taking notes&quot; ... etc.</p><p>[ok, digression over, back to the main thread ...]</p><p>i couldn&apos;t get that rock riff out of my head, and heard it<br/>in my mind constantly as i wandered over a rather large<br/>chunk of Europe that month.  &quot;pictorial&quot; ideas for developing<br/>it into a piece occurred to me as i traveled ... in other<br/>words, i was getting &quot;programmatic&quot; ideas (and i may have<br/>even thought of the lyrics while i was there too -- can&apos;t<br/>remember now) for what i wanted the piece to be &quot;about&quot;.</p><p>as i said, about 5 days after i got home, a musical idea<br/>(the &quot;changing-meters&quot; section) occured to me which fit<br/>perfectly with the mental pictures i had of Europe and<br/>the piece.  i sat down at the computer, opened up a<br/>Cakewalk &quot;Piano Roll&quot; window, and started popping in<br/>the notes i heard in my head.</p><p>[another digression ...]</p><p>this process didn&apos;t reflect the original inspiration as<br/>well as it usually does -- generally, i have a &quot;homophonic&quot;<br/>type of idea, melody / chords / bass line, and i can drop<br/>it into Cakewalk quite easily and quickly, usually in<br/>&quot;Staff&quot; view, because to me that&apos;s the most like simply<br/>writing it down quickly on paper, which is the way i&apos;m<br/>used to composing.</p><p>(to me, it&apos;s really an awful lot like writing emails!<br/>the idea gets into my head, the hands put it onto the<br/>computer screen, and the eyes -- and also ears in the<br/>case of the music -- give me the feedback i need.)</p><p>but this time was a bit different -- to begin with,<br/>the changing-meters section was a contrapuntal (not<br/>melody/chords/bass) idea, in more of a &quot;classical&quot;<br/>(really Renaissance) sense.  secondly, i put in the<br/>melody and bass for just the first few measures, and<br/>as soon as i added the bass part, it changed the way<br/>i was hearing the melody in my mind.</p><p>[another digression over, back to the main thread...]</p><p>i was very happy with this new section:</p><p>1) - partly because i think the counterpoint works beautifully,<br/>and i&apos;m always very pleased when i can &quot;handle my craft&quot;<br/>so well,</p><p>2) - partly because in &quot;Piano Roll&quot; view i&apos;m not thinking<br/>so much in terms of notes/chords/theory/etc., but simply<br/>l o o k i n g   at the visual analog (in pitch-height terms)<br/>of what i hear in my mind.  to me it&apos;s more like playing<br/>an instrument, which is to say, more like improvising than<br/>composing (on paper), the former of which i  l i k e   more<br/>because of the sonic feedback i get, and it&apos;s also always<br/>more  f u n  to play (improvise) than to compose on paper.</p><p>and 3) - partly because the changing meters seem to me to<br/>flow so naturally and unforced, and near the end of the<br/>section result in a confusion of &quot;where&apos;s the one?&quot;</p><p>then little by little all the different parts seem to<br/>find their way back, so that their &quot;one&quot; downbeat is<br/>synchronized (like Beethoven, i really love to &quot;break<br/>the rules&quot; as much as possible, and then try to make it<br/>so logically inescapable that you&apos;d never dream of having<br/>it any other way ... and also like Beethoven, i really<br/>enjoy amusing stuff and practical jokes in my music<br/>to me, asymetrical and changing meters is  b i g  fun!).</p><p>then, just as it seems that a nice stable 4/4 meter<br/>is finally going to arrive (for the first time since<br/>the introduction) ...  B A M  !<br/>the bongoes come in half a beat early in anticipation,<br/>(sort of like an announcement) and the rock riff crashes in.</p><p>in that light, i think i prefer the &quot;poorly engineered&quot;<br/>version, because with the clipping, the rock riff<br/>r e a l l y   d o e s   &quot;crash in&quot;.</p><p>sure, i&apos;d like to work on this some more.  for one<br/>thing, i want to put a screaming guitar solo over the<br/>repeated hard-rock section during the last half of the<br/>piece.  and yes, i&apos;d like to re-engineer it to get it<br/>sounding closer to what i hear in my mind.</p><p>but at any rate, the important point i&apos;m making here<br/>is that the sound of that &quot;final&quot; version (if there is<br/>such a thing -- very many of my pieces have been revised<br/>continually as i&apos;ve kept listening) is now going to be<br/>highly influenced by this current &quot;poorly engineered&quot;<br/>version, because i like  i t  better than my original idea!</p><p>... and i think that&apos;s an interesting outcome.</p><p>hope y&apos;all enjoyed the long ramble ...</p><p>and i   r e a l l y   hope many of you like the  p i e c e<br/>as much as i do.  if anyone would like to help out or<br/>contribute a solo, send me an email  (dante, Dan Stearns,<br/>Haverstick? ... all of you are welcome to do the guitar jam!)</p><p>-monz</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=2432 href="#2432">ðŸ”—</a>graham@...</h3><span>2/28/2002 5:21:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>In-Reply-To: &lt;006601c1c042$a2ce7b20$af48620c@...&gt;<br/>monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; the part that sounds the worst to me, production-wise, is<br/>&gt; after the part in changing meters, right where it goes into<br/>&gt; the full-blown version of the hard-rock section for the first<br/>&gt; time.  there&apos;s some clipping there that i don&apos;t think i can<br/>&gt; digitally remove -- it would require recording it over again.</p><p>I heard some annoying drop outs, which may be bass distortion.</p><p>&gt; but then, after listening to the mp3 for a while, i actually<br/>&gt; liked that clipping more and more, because to me it really<br/>&gt; evokes the sound of explosions that happened at the<br/>&gt; World Trade Center on 9-11.</p><p>You could always cover them up with white noise, filtered to order.<br/>That&apos;d sound even more explosive.</p><p>&gt; i couldn&apos;t get that rock riff out of my head, and heard it<br/>&gt; in my mind constantly as i wandered over a rather large<br/>&gt; chunk of Europe that month.  &quot;pictorial&quot; ideas for developing<br/>&gt; it into a piece occurred to me as i traveled ... in other<br/>&gt; words, i was getting &quot;programmatic&quot; ideas (and i may have<br/>&gt; even thought of the lyrics while i was there too -- can&apos;t<br/>&gt; remember now) for what i wanted the piece to be &quot;about&quot;.</p><p>You didn&apos;t mention any of this at the time!</p><p>&gt; in that light, i think i prefer the &quot;poorly engineered&quot;<br/>&gt; version, because with the clipping, the rock riff<br/>&gt; r e a l l y   d o e s   &quot;crash in&quot;.</p><p>I don&apos;t know, it&apos;s more like the other musicians see it coming and stop<br/>playing while they get out of its way.</p><p>Aside from these occasional glitches, the main problem I hear with the<br/>engineering is that it&apos;s too clean.

What timings should the solo be for?  What tuning,<br/>and is there a chord structure you want kept to?</p><p>It may be better to have the riff varying instead of cluttering up the mix<br/>with another voice (listen to the White Stripes for homework).  Or maybe<br/>add a counter-melody to it instead of a lead.

As this is the second time you&apos;ve<br/>&gt; mentioned liking the accidents, have you thought of deliberately adding<br/>&gt; distortion and noise to it?  The only other way improvement I can envisage<br/>&gt; would be to record from scratch with better synthesis (or real<br/>&gt; instruments).  I seem to have a different aesthetic on production to<br/>&gt; everybody else round here, so ignore me if you like ...</p><p>thanks for those suggestions.  i used to have a pretty<br/>good studio set-up, with a Yamaha TG-77, Korg DS-8,<br/>Fatar 88-key weighted-key controller, etc., but it<br/>was all stolen years ago.  i haven&apos;t gotten around to<br/>replacing any of it, and have been limited to what i<br/>can do entirely on my PC.</p><p>but i&apos;m one of those composers who feel ok with others<br/>doing their own versions of my work, at least for most<br/>of my pieces.  so if you&apos;d like to produce your own version<br/>of _Cruising thru the Ruins_, go ahead, that&apos;s fine with me!<br/>i&apos;m eager to hear it!  that goes for anyone else here as well.</p><p>&gt; &gt; but at any rate, the important point i&apos;m making here<br/>&gt; &gt; is that the sound of that &quot;final&quot; version (if there is<br/>&gt; &gt; such a thing -- very many of my pieces have been revised<br/>&gt; &gt; continually as i&apos;ve kept listening) is now going to be<br/>&gt; &gt; highly influenced by this current &quot;poorly engineered&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; version, because i like  i t  better than my original idea!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There you go again!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; ... and i think that&apos;s an interesting outcome.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sure is.  Have you tried sending the whole thing through guitar effects?</p><p>nope.  do you mean PC guitar effects, or the real deal<br/>in hardware?  if you make your own version of the song,<br/>maybe you&apos;ll try this?</p><p>&gt; &gt; hope y&apos;all enjoyed the long ramble ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes, I did have to clip a lot of it.</p><p>?</p><p>&gt; &gt; and i   r e a l l y   hope many of you like the  p i e c e<br/>&gt; &gt; as much as i do.  if anyone would like to help out or<br/>&gt; &gt; contribute a solo, send me an email  (dante, Dan Stearns,<br/>&gt; &gt; Haverstick? ... all of you are welcome to do the guitar jam!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Indeed, I do like it.  What timings should the solo be for?<br/>&gt; What tuning, and is there a chord structure you want kept to?</p><p>i composed the introductino and the &quot;changing-meters&quot; section<br/>strictly by a correlation between the visual representation<br/>on the Cakewalk &quot;Piano Roll&quot; view and the sound when i played it.<br/>i couldn&apos;t tell you what any of the notes are in that section.</p><p>for the hard-rock section, i thought of it in typical meantone<br/>or 12edo terms originally (i&apos;m not sure which, or perhaps it<br/>was even both) :</p><p>Bm  Bbm  A  G#dim7  Gmaj7  G#half-dim7  A7+4+5</p><p>and the second time around, the last chord is a plain A7.</p><p>but again, when i began to enter this into Cakewalk, the<br/>individual parts were entered not in &quot;Staff&quot; view but in<br/>&quot;Piano Roll&quot; view, and they changed a bit according to<br/>how i was hearing and seeing what i entered.</p><p>so really, i&apos;d have to go thru the MIDI-file and<br/>analyze what i did, because other than what i wrote<br/>above, i&apos;m not sure what it is.  it was very intuitive,<br/>which is one reason why i like this piece so much.</p><p>&gt; It may be better to have the riff varying instead of cluttering up the mix<br/>&gt; with another voice (listen to the White Stripes for homework).
