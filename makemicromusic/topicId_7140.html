I&apos;ve been kind of unofficially<br/>archiving it since joining. I used earlier digests from<br/>Manuel and Monz to complete the collection..</p><p>I also wrote a program to make an html archive of it.<br/>There though I did ask people&apos;s permission to include<br/>their posts. Some posters to the main tuning list<br/>feel very strongly that they don&apos;t want their posts<br/>archived. So it has to be opt in.</p><p>Yahoogroups can put them up on their website<br/>because they get permission from us all to do so<br/>when we join. People who write programs to<br/>download an archive of other people&apos;s posts<br/>without their permission are on somewhat<br/>dubious ground I think. At least out of<br/>respect I for one wouldn&apos;t do that.<br/>But searching the yahoogroups archive<br/>is okay I think because the posts<br/>remain in their original location<br/>and aren&apos;t copied. The posts are all<br/>the copyright of the original posters.</p><p>I know that Google archived usenet<br/>or something, and that it caches some<br/>yahoogroups posts in its search<br/>engine. But presumably they have<br/>gone into it with top notch lawyers<br/>and know it is okay to do it for<br/>some reason or other. Whether it<br/>is leagally okay or not I think<br/>one should ask permission.<br/>I know of several posters to<br/>the tuning list who told me privately<br/>that they felt strongly that they<br/>didn&apos;t want their posts in the archive.</p><p>I gather that mainly the point of view is<br/>that they posted them as ephemeral posts<br/>and not as finished publications.<br/>They would be interested perhaps in<br/>contributing considered finished material<br/>to a properly conducted tuning faq or<br/>some such - but not in contributing raw<br/>chatty unconsidered posts to an archive.</p><p>It is a minority view, only a few think like that,<br/>but those who do sometimes feel<br/>very strongly about it.</p><p>Technically it is a bit tricky because once<br/>you get permission you still have<br/>to recognise the poster in the archives<br/>and e-mail address often change.<br/>So one can get gaps in the archives<br/>even from posters who have given their<br/>permission sometimes.</p><p>Anyway - on this point - I still<br/>have my archiving program and all<br/>the digests. Also now I also have<br/>the space on-line too (it needed over<br/>100 Mb when converted to html with all<br/>the indexes by subject, date, and author)</p><p>I also have permission from many of<br/>the main posters to the list to include their posts.<br/>So I can do an archive and upload<br/>it quite quickly. I haven&apos;t done<br/>that mainly because there were<br/>bugs in the old Mills section of the<br/>archive that needed to be fixed first.</p><p>But if there is a strong wish for it<br/>now then I can do it right away<br/>with the bugs. They probably won&apos;t<br/>get fixed any time soon unfortunately<br/>because of other commitmemnts and they were<br/>relatively tricky ones to fix. But not so very major.<br/>Maybe some of the old Mills posts<br/>will get concatenated or duplicated<br/>or something, maybe even wrongly<br/>attributed in the index so you<br/>click on an entry and end up with<br/>a post from someone different from<br/>who you expect. I&apos;m not sure,<br/>though it was long ago now and<br/>can&apos;t remember the details.<br/>It only affected the Mills archives<br/>and not the more recent yahoogroups<br/>postings and was something to do with the<br/>difference in the format of the digests<br/>and coping with small variations<br/>in the format, but I can&apos;t<br/>remember the details now.</p><p>The yahoogroups ones are easy because each<br/>message ends with:<br/>________________________________________________________________________<br/>________________________________________________________________________</p><p>and you just need to search for that to split them<br/>up.</p><p>The posts might even be searchable - could all be<br/>put into one folder in text format - but would<br/>have gaps because of the opt in nature<br/>so one would need to choose between a possibly<br/>faster search of text files in a folder<br/>on a server that maybe could even host the script<br/>too - and the completeness of the yahoogroups archives.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=7141 href="#7141">ðŸ”—</a>Carl Lumma &#x3C;ekin@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2004 3:08:27 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;I&apos;ve got all the posts ever sent to the tuning list<br/>&gt;in digests or other form.
