One of the major<br/>differences seems to be that John&apos;s approach rests on the<br/>use of familiar (just) intervals which form the basis of<br/>the &quot;pain&quot; calculations (I think I sort of prefer John&apos;s<br/>original &quot;spring&quot; terminology!) to define the tables used to adjust the pitches.</p><p>In the system used in the &quot;string quartet&quot; now at:</p><p><a href="/makemicromusic/files/sethares/Recalled_Opus.mp3">/makemicromusic/files/sethares/Recalled_Opus.mp3</a></p><p>the basic idea is to calculate the sensory dissonance at each<br/>time instant and to move all sounding notes in the direction of<br/>smaller dissonance. By using the parameterization of the<br/>Plomp-Levelt calculations that Ive used before, its possible<br/>to write this as a &quot;gradient descent&quot; algorithm. Hence one of<br/>the strengths of this system is that it can be applied directly<br/>to inharmonic sounds (even though it was not used so here -<br/>since the partials of the violins are hamronically related.)<br/>One of the strengths of John&apos;s approach is that it also takes<br/>into account successive notes - all of my algorithms have<br/>been &quot;instantaneous&quot;.</p><p>You can clearly hear the action of the algorithm in the piece.<br/>The compositional method used here was to start each tone on<br/>its 12-tet location and to adapt the pitches (in real time<br/>using a MAX patch). When the pitches begin close to JI intervals<br/>such as a 12-tet fifth, then the adjustment is only a few cents.<br/>But when the pitches begin at far from JI intervals (such as a<br/>12-tet minor 2), then the sweeps of pitch are quite dramatic.<br/>All of the pitch bending in the piece is done by the algorithm<br/>in real time (though the whole thing was not performed in real<br/>time - I cut and pasted sections together).</p><p>I&apos;ve written about the method, and you can find a copy of<br/>my 1994 JASA paper at:</p><p><a href="http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/adaptun.pdf">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/paperspdf/adaptun.pdf</a></p></div><h3><a id=1306 href="#1306">ðŸ”—</a>sethares@...</h3><span>11/30/2001 9:26:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Beautiful work Bill!!</p><p>thanks</p><p>&gt;Nice string timbres. Did you do that on the ASR? Sounds sweet.</p><p>Yes, these were violin (and viola) samples from K.

How about a little tune to showcase that!???</p><p>I have a piece that was 95% finished about three years ago,<br/>How long can it take to do the final mixdown?</p></div><h3><a id=1309 href="#1309">ðŸ”—</a>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/30/2001 1:40:02 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Bill,</p><p>Really intriguing quartet (I did get *most* of it to download...). I<br/>know you went into a more lengthy explanation on the &apos;how&apos; of it, but<br/>was this a piece written for exploration, or did you at some point<br/>envision a live quartet making those kind of adjustments?</p><p>IOW, a strictly electronic/recorded incarnation, or something to be<br/>performed at a time and date TBD?</p><p>&gt; I have a piece that was 95% finished about three years ago,<br/>&gt; How long can it take to do the final mixdown?</p><p>How long do you have? :)</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div>
