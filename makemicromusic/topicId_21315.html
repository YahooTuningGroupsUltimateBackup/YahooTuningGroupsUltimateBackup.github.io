For indeed,<br/>this is the first time in my life I have worked the capabilities of a<br/>professional DAW to a desirable potential. I discover many things slowly... The Saba Storm is but a product of much experimenting and<br/>getting the feel of Logic Pro.</p><p>It pleases me immensely to hear you say that this track is outstanding<br/>and candidate for the &quot;best microtonal beat hall of fame&quot;.<br/>Staggering... since I am but an ignoramus when it comes to<br/>professional audio mastering. I only trust my ears and judgment in<br/>tweaking the many parameters of the mixing console and drag-dropping<br/>stuff from the loop library. But considering your satisfaction with<br/>The Saba Storm, I guess I am progressing fairly swiftly in that<br/>direction!</p><p>I think you mean that ugly saw-synth I used at 1:04. I tried a Bansuri<br/>Indian flute to imitate a Turkish ney, but could not. In the end, I<br/>was stuck with that saw.</p><p>Or do you mean the very loud supersaw that comes in at 0:43? I meant to use that very loud piercing supersaw synth sound to tear through<br/>the heart of the storm, bursting with the melancholy of maqam Saba.</p><p>The guitar-like part that makes its first appearance at 1:14 is<br/>nothing other than the simple oud, the ancestor of medieval lutes, and<br/>an indispensable timbre of Maqam music. It reappears several times,<br/>but not at 6:30 (The piece is only 5:13 seconds, remember?). Maybe you<br/>meant 4:30?</p><p>The piercing Shawm sound you hear at times is an Indian Shehnai Oboe,<br/>not much difference from the Turkish Zurna. For the lack of anything<br/>closer, I used this Shehnai. I think it was a nice touch.</p><p>I wanted to emphasize the melody in The Saba Storm, that is why the<br/>beat is not as strong as you expect. However, it is a simple task to<br/>augment it. I can prepare a version with stronger beats if you promise<br/>to play it at a live gig. But you need to announce that it is by Dr.<br/>Oz, and direct the audience to visit <a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a>. :)</p><p>Thanks again for the nice comments!</p><p>Cordially,<br/>Oz.</p><p>&#x2729; &#x2729; &#x2729;<br/><a href="http://www.ozanyarman.com">www.ozanyarman.com</a></p><p>On Oct 29, 2009, at 10:57 PM, Michael wrote:</p><p>&gt; Ozan,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    This is an absolutely outstanding piece.

I&apos;ve seen very few tracks that do this well, &quot;Finished Symphony&quot; by Hybrid being another one of them.<br/>    My personal view is that a good enough instrumental arrangement with well tuned drums, well chosen chords, instruments spread evenly over octaves and frequency ranges...with sound quite clear and loud by itself and only need minimal mastering.  Hence...I think your orchestration skills are solving most of the problems &quot;mastering&quot; (compression, limiting, EQ, etc.) is designed to solve.  Personal experience tells me it&apos;s often a good idea to focus on orchestration extensively before adding a an extra boost through mastering...because too much mastering often makes a track sound artificial and forced (regardless of how loud it makes the track).</p><p>&gt;&quot;I only trust my ears and judgment in tweaking the many parameters of the mixing console and drag-dropping  stuff from the loop library.&quot;<br/>   Of course, the critic in me says &quot;ultimately you should make your own beats from scratch&quot;.  The good news is you already seem to have a knack for finding what style of rhythm works well.  You had me convinced you did make the drums from scratch...because they fit so well.</p><p>&gt;&quot;I think you mean that ugly saw-synth I used at 1:04. I tried a Bansuri  Indian flute to imitate a Turkish ney, but could not. In the end, I was stuck with that saw.&quot;<br/>   Both...I know how it goes trying to find good samples of exotic instruments (not easy to do).  But anything you can do to avoid pure saw, triangle, or square waves (primitive analogue-type sounds) is good, IMVHO, because those all (at least to me) sound buzzy and inorganic, especially in your music (which otherwise sounds incredibly organic and smooth).<br/>    I&apos;d highly recommend <a href="http://oneshotsamples.com">oneshotsamples.com</a> (which is 100% free) for finding good ethnic instrument samples for Logic.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The guitar-like part that makes its first appearance at 1:14 is  nothing other than the simple oud, the ancestor of medieval lutes, and  an indispensable timbre of Maqam music.&quot;<br/>    I get the feeling my Windows Media Player (mp3 player)  isn&apos;t tracking the time correctly...you&apos;re probably right.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The guitar-like part that makes its first appearance at 1:14 is nothing other than the simple oud, the ancestor of medieval lutes&quot;<br/>    I was about to say, it sounds much cooler than a standard acoustic guitar.</p><p>&gt;&quot;The piercing Shawm sound you hear at times is an Indian Shehnai Oboe,  not much difference from the Turkish Zurna.
