That is hard science.&quot;</p><p>----------------------------THE BELOW (AGAIN) IS MY SPECIFIC TESTING<br/>METHOD--------------<br/>   Right, and my equivalent to &quot;Toxicity Analysis&quot; includes the following<br/> A) Hard numeric measurement of EVERY SINGLE POSSIBLE DYAD in each mode of my<br/>scale to a fixed list of desirable dyads (dyads gathered from suggestions by<br/>people like Igs and Cameron)<br/>B) Doing so  against a fixed tolerance of &lt; 8 cents (suggested by people such as<br/>Kraig and John).<br/>C) Then I tested the results as chords on MMM (see the Dimension scale dyads<br/>example in my folder) and asked people to listen.</p><p>D) Then I made songs with the Dimension scale and again  asked people to listen<br/>and rate them.</p><p>E) Then I asked Igs, Chris, and others to try composing with the scale and tell<br/>me what they think and what problems they found along the way.</p><p>  At ALL points of the process...I asked for input from OTHER PEOPLE and did NOT<br/>simply stick with my own assumptions without outside input.  Now if you think I<br/>could have found a better WAY to ask them or get parameters, for example, please<br/>say so and how!<br/>----------------------------<br/>   Now why does that fail to count to you as specifics?!  Or what would Ozan do<br/>(if he were me) as a test that would qualify as specific or enough?</p><p>   You&apos;ve given your complaints repeatedly...now either give a fair alternative<br/>to me...or simply be a hypocrit and don&apos;t help at all.  If you want to criticize<br/>my method...you need to say specifically what&apos;s missing in testing, not give<br/>some grandiose complaints IE say it&apos;s  &quot;psuedoscience&quot; while never even<br/>bothering to reference a single part of method I used to actually test my scale<br/>in your explanation of WHY you think it&apos;s psuedoscience.</p><p>   If you want to disprove me, you must ALSO give specific examples...and from<br/>what I&apos;ve SAID my research has been, not what you &quot;guess&quot; my research has<br/>been...</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div>
