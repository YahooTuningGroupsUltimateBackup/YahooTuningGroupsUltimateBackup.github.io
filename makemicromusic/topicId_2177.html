Well I suppose that would make it more<br/>exciting to<br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; wouldn&apos;t it.  Hope so.  Before too long I&apos;ll have a website with<br/>&gt; ordering<br/>&gt; &gt; information and project information and newsletter<br/>subscriptions<br/>&gt; and updates<br/>&gt; &gt; and announcements and all that good stuff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &quot;CDsssssssssss&quot; Gooooood!<br/>&gt; Let us know when you&apos;ve got it up on the web.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you tell us all about it?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; It, them, sure, what do you want to know.  All about it hm...  In<br/>&gt; between<br/>&gt; &gt; trying to revive some pop and progressive projects from the<br/>80s and<br/>&gt; 90s,<br/>&gt; &gt; well, I&apos;m staying with this pseudo classical stuff for now.  I<br/>&gt; might have<br/>&gt; &gt; one of the rock albums done by May I don1t know.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; What then:  guitar and midi stuff... microtonal piano sonatas,<br/>the<br/>&gt; mostly<br/>&gt; &gt; electric string quartet no. 2 will be on CD for the premiere in<br/>&gt; May, I&apos;M<br/>&gt; &gt; ALSO REMIXING NO. 1 HINT HINT, I&apos;m also doing microtonal<br/>acoustic<br/>&gt; string<br/>&gt; &gt; quartets (you know, violins, viola, cello), possibly a few other<br/>&gt; types of<br/>&gt; &gt; pieces.  I figure I should keep prefacing with &quot;microtonal&quot; so I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t get<br/>&gt; &gt; asked, of course microtonal, everything I do has meticulous<br/>&gt; consideration<br/>&gt; &gt; for the pitch time and volume of every note.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I also have some microtonal symphonies brewing too but<br/>even though<br/>&gt; I have my<br/>&gt; &gt; DSP specs down for mixing I&apos;m not sure I have good enough<br/>patches.<br/>&gt; Invite<br/>&gt; &gt; to anyone... Send me some decent orchestral instrument<br/>samples and<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll get<br/>&gt; &gt; the symphonies done.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Oh yeah and interspersed, I&apos;m doing a lot of Beethoven stuff<br/>in<br/>&gt; different<br/>&gt; &gt; temperaments.  Still not sure why.  Maybe to show how<br/>ductile the<br/>&gt; structures<br/>&gt; &gt; are.  Mozart maybe soon.  Don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; Wow - what an amazing range of styles! Had no idea.<br/>&gt; Yes - it can be tough to emulate an orchestra with samples.<br/>&gt; Always ends up sounding like &quot;something else&quot; - but I do enjoy<br/>this<br/>&gt; kind of thing very much.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Will these all be solo guitar?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; I can&apos;t see myself doing solo guitar.  Even quartets and such,<br/>I<br/>&gt; always have<br/>&gt; &gt; at least two layers per instrument.  If I did solo guitar it would<br/>&gt; still<br/>&gt; &gt; probably be double tracked.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; I think mastering a performance for CD allows one to open up<br/>&quot;other&quot;<br/>&gt; levels of compositional languages. To me it has as much<br/>integrity as<br/>&gt; playing it all live. It&apos;s the &quot;studio as compositional instrument&quot;<br/>&gt; that appeals to me. It can be acoustic or electronic - or both at<br/>&gt; once. That&apos;s the beauty of it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Or will they be ensemble pieces with a group of players?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; That&apos;s a tricky question.  Maybe you can figure out why.  You<br/>were<br/>&gt; on ST for<br/>&gt; &gt; awhile hmm.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Mostly me otherwise.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well then again, find me some people who actually want to<br/>play my<br/>&gt; music with<br/>&gt; &gt; me and then maybe I&apos;ll have a different answer.  I&apos;m open to it<br/>but<br/>&gt; outside<br/>&gt; &gt; of being cancelled on last minute for the microthon, I don&apos;t<br/>know<br/>&gt; of a lot<br/>&gt; &gt; of people who can do it, at least not in the neighborhood.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; To tell the truth, I find it exceedingly difficult to find musicians<br/>&gt; to collaborate with, because you say &quot;microtones&quot;, and you get<br/>that<br/>&gt; big -   ;  ()  ???????????????? What-The???? &quot;Look&quot;. Then<br/>they go<br/>&gt; running away.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I do have one hard-core guy though, but he&apos;s a percussion<br/>player.<br/>&gt; Don&apos;t have to worry about any arguing over tunings!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; :  )<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you over-dub you guitar in recordings?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re asking.  If anything I over and over<br/>and<br/>&gt; over dub<br/>&gt; &gt; my guitar... I do most of my stuff on an iMac.  I only started<br/>&gt; really<br/>&gt; &gt; getting to use my TX81z a couple months ago, after having it<br/>&gt; shuffled<br/>&gt; &gt; between storage spaces for years.  So I still have an old<br/>serial Mac<br/>&gt; &gt; outboard midi setup I&apos;m trying to get some use out of.  There<br/>are<br/>&gt; always<br/>&gt; &gt; microtones there, I could never think of it as obsolete.  Umm<br/>&gt; especially<br/>&gt; &gt; when I&apos;ve never recorded with half of it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; Interesting! But you know you can only play up to 768 tET with<br/>the<br/>&gt; TX81Z! This&apos;ll be a severe limitation I&apos;m imagining!<br/>&gt; All joking aside - I love the &quot;Zs&quot;. Have got two of them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What is your style like?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes.<br/>&gt; &gt; ...<br/>&gt; &gt; BAAAAAAAAA ...seriously.  People have said my piano stuff<br/>sounds<br/>&gt; like Rick<br/>&gt; &gt; Wakeman and my guitar stuff sounds like Steve Howe.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A lot of it is sort of classically inflected jazz rock fusion.<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a<br/>&gt; &gt; sortof middle of the road thing, it&apos;s not really pop or<br/>classically<br/>&gt; geared<br/>&gt; &gt; so it winds up being a little bit pleasant to just about anyone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; This and the above gives me a good idea, and thanks for it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is you music acoustic or electric guitar oriented?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; Not all my music is guitar oriented.  I suppose mostly<br/>electric.<br/>&gt; Those two<br/>&gt; &gt; words just keep popping up side by side don&apos;t they.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; They just go hand in hand - eh?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ;  )<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ve read some of your fascinating posts about your fret-<br/>boards<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; such, but never was clear about if they are acoustic or<br/>electric<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; guitars.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;m in the process of chopping up an acoustic to accept my<br/>&gt; interchangeable<br/>&gt; &gt; boards (see below).  Other than that, I&apos;m currently only using<br/>&gt; electric.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; May I ask if you are a &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;?<br/>&gt; (You like Strat-tone single coil pickups?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ;  )<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; When you fret guitars with large ET frettings, say above 31,<br/>do<br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; use a subset from the ET, or do you somehow use *all* of<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; increments of the ET?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; All.  As I said, up to 217 with playability of each note.<br/>&gt; Including 323 and<br/>&gt; &gt; 559 which were harder to handle but seemed to work with no<br/>buzz.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; Simply one of the most amazing things I&apos;ve heard - I mean<br/>read, but<br/>&gt; desire greatly to hear.<br/>&gt; Are you able to keep the neck at regular scale with all these<br/>frets?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; I haven&apos;t actually &quot;fretted&quot; a guitar in some time.  I have a<br/>&gt; guitar ready<br/>&gt; &gt; to accept interchangeable fretboards.  I use plywood.  I start<br/>with<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; smooth surface and rout an ellipticylindrical cavity in<br/>between.  I<br/>&gt; leave a<br/>&gt; &gt; small space on the surface about the same size of a fret, or<br/>that<br/>&gt; is, the<br/>&gt; &gt; same proportion of fret-space to space-in-between.  In a<br/>Polish<br/>&gt; way, I<br/>&gt; &gt; seemed to have discovered a way to yield the desired result:<br/>a<br/>&gt; smooth<br/>&gt; &gt; fretting surface with each note distinguishable with no<br/>change in<br/>&gt; timbre.<br/>&gt; &gt; It suffices to contrast: the 22 bass I made Fred had buzzes in<br/>a<br/>&gt; few places<br/>&gt; &gt; whereas I&apos;ve never had a problem with a board.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The boards attach to the neck by a bolt around the octave<br/>and a<br/>&gt; little<br/>&gt; &gt; makeshift support around the nut.  Compared to what<br/>anyone would<br/>&gt; have to pay<br/>&gt; &gt; to get a microtonal guitar done &quot;professionally&quot;, if you&apos;re the<br/>&gt; kind of<br/>&gt; &gt; enthusiast who wants to try any and every temperament you<br/>can on<br/>&gt; guitar...?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; A friend of Steven DiMarzio quoted me $2000 to calibrate his<br/>&gt; machine to make<br/>&gt; &gt; me a 19 back in the day, and then I should try to make as<br/>many<br/>&gt; guitars as<br/>&gt; &gt; possible because it wouldn&apos;t happen again.  So they&apos;d be like<br/>$5000<br/>&gt; apiece.<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;ve heard up to $1000 for luthiers.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Um piece of plywood cut up and oh by the way I HAVE TO<br/>rout boards<br/>&gt; double<br/>&gt; &gt; sided or they warp.  So... Just by the board space, minus my<br/>labor<br/>&gt; time<br/>&gt; &gt; obviously, it&apos;s hard work but it comes down to about umm 6<br/>&gt; temperaments for<br/>&gt; &gt; a dollar.  (I forget not everyone does it this way so I wonder<br/>why<br/>&gt; people<br/>&gt; &gt; have never tried more than a temperament or two.)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; But of late I&apos;ve thought of making certain scale boards.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; Thanks for this description. It gives me a great window into the<br/>kind<br/>&gt; of craftsmanship that you possess - something I can really<br/>respect<br/>&gt; (since I tinker with wood and tools on occasion).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I&apos;ve found your statements about how certain frettings affect<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; timbre of the instrument. Can you speak about this a bit?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; Arf.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sit UBU sit...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Wait you&apos;ve FOUND THEM?  Oh thank god I thought I&apos;d lost<br/>them for<br/>&gt; good.  You<br/>&gt; &gt; found them...?  Interesting?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; EVERY fretting affects the timbre of the instrument.  No two<br/>&gt; temperaments<br/>&gt; &gt; sound quite the same on the same guitar.  If you know how<br/>to pinch a<br/>&gt; &gt; harmonic, it&apos;s related to that.  The different fret positions<br/>&gt; excite certain<br/>&gt; &gt; frequencies while dampening others.  It sort of teases and<br/>encodes<br/>&gt; each note<br/>&gt; &gt; you have a fret for into the sound of every note, so that no<br/>matter<br/>&gt; where<br/>&gt; &gt; you go melodically, it sounds contiguous.  Filling in the rest<br/>of<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; waveform from this is a unique recursive structure of<br/>something<br/>&gt; along the<br/>&gt; &gt; line of formants, almost the same thing as a vocal pattern,<br/>which<br/>&gt; gives each<br/>&gt; &gt; temperament its own recognizable &quot;voice&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; Makes perfect sense, now that you explain it. This is<br/>something that<br/>&gt; is not usually found on a synth - to be sure!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Any advice you could give to a novice about how to learn<br/>how to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; navigate a large ET on a guitar, when they may be coming<br/>from the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; familiar language of a 12 tET fretting?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; Plenty of advice.  Plenty of markings.  Enough so you can find<br/>your<br/>&gt; way<br/>&gt; &gt; around quickly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; Ah - the &quot;secret&quot; is revealed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you ever play fretless? Seems to be becoming very<br/>popular these<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; days.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, not smooth, no.  I did at times in the early 1990s.  But<br/>my<br/>&gt; &gt; interchangeable boards are all carved in, there&apos;s nothing<br/>built<br/>&gt; up.  So in a<br/>&gt; &gt; sense, I always play fretless, only sort of scalloped.  It makes<br/>a<br/>&gt; lot more<br/>&gt; &gt; sense to start with a flat surface so your fretting areas are<br/>&gt; flush.  I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; &gt; thought of routing metal.  Might be heavy but it might have<br/>some<br/>&gt; interesting<br/>&gt; &gt; effects on the timbre.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; At what point of 2/1 puree (high ets), do you find it to<br/>&gt; become &quot;fretless-like&quot;?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you like distortion, chorus or reverb effects on guitar, or<br/>do<br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; feel that effects can obscure the sound of the tuning?<br/>Haverstick<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; does some amazing stuff with distort-o micro-guitars on<br/>occasion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; For the most part, I like keeping the guitar sounds clean<br/>because I<br/>&gt; wind up<br/>&gt; &gt; layering them and the combinations are interesting enough.<br/>&gt; Anything I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; used to, 17, 19 whatever yeah crank it up.  The only real<br/>&quot;effect&quot;<br/>&gt; I tend to<br/>&gt; &gt; use is a normal recording overdrive, that is, playing loud<br/>enough<br/>&gt; so the<br/>&gt; &gt; input device peaks.  Otherwise, all the usual guitar effects I<br/>like<br/>&gt; applying<br/>&gt; &gt; to 41, moreso 43.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; Fascinating. And makes sense.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you like nylon strings or metal?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; I used to like playing nylon strings.  I haven&apos;t yet gotten<br/>around<br/>&gt; to having<br/>&gt; &gt; a microtonal interchangeable acoustic.  On the list of things<br/>to do<br/>&gt; now that<br/>&gt; &gt; I have some domestic stability for the first time in about 10<br/>&gt; years.  That<br/>&gt; &gt; an an interchangeable 12 string.  I used to have a 12-string<br/>19-<br/>&gt; tone, metal<br/>&gt; &gt; frets.  SHINGGGGG...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; Now you&apos;re talking! I love the 12 string - like the Towner variety.<br/>&gt; Would be cool to hear this indeed!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you ever use MOS (Myhills Property) - 2 step size<br/>tunings as a<br/>&gt; way<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of subsetting from large number ETs?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; If you&apos;re talking about two-size-interval scales, sure, all the<br/>&gt; time.  My<br/>&gt; &gt; markings are mostly extended diatonic scales, with a hint of<br/>where<br/>&gt; harmonics<br/>&gt; &gt; are so I don&apos;t have to carry a manual around just to play an<br/>&gt; infrequently<br/>&gt; &gt; accessed temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; I like them too, although for me it is usually a keyboard<br/>&gt; consideration.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; What are some of your favorite prime number ETs -<br/>especially the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; lower number ones?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; Favorite PRIMES?  Is this a trick question?  If it is, the answer<br/>&gt; is 31.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well I like everything I have... Primes, let&apos;s see.  I go back a<br/>&gt; long way<br/>&gt; &gt; with 19.  Of course 31.  I really thought a lot more people<br/>would<br/>&gt; be into<br/>&gt; &gt; 29.  Seems not so.  I don&apos;t suppose too many people have<br/>made the<br/>&gt; guitar.  I<br/>&gt; &gt; think the discovery is all in the timbre.  I can usually hack the<br/>&gt; midi with<br/>&gt; &gt; no affection in the timbre, but for something like 23 I think I&apos;d<br/>&gt; really<br/>&gt; &gt; have to build the board one day.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I shouldn&apos;t really talk now about how much I like 37.  It&apos;s a bit<br/>&gt; esoteric<br/>&gt; &gt; at this point.  41 and 43 I could play for hours.  Actually when I<br/>&gt; first<br/>&gt; &gt; heard your music I thought you might like 41.  I like listening<br/>to<br/>&gt; things in<br/>&gt; &gt; 59.  61 has really good 5th limit separation for sketching...<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I could go on.  You called over 31 &quot;high&quot; though.  Hmm.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Should I anticipate you might want to know non-primes as<br/>well...?<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a<br/>&gt; &gt; sort of puzzle to make 15 work but rewarding when you do.<br/>Of<br/>&gt; course I like<br/>&gt; &gt; 22 but it gets me lazy.  26 I don&apos;t use as much as I should.  I<br/>&gt; have a basic<br/>&gt; &gt; logic grid for 27 that you&apos;ll hear in a lot of my work, especially<br/>&gt; my first<br/>&gt; &gt; piano sonata.  I used to use 34 a lot for pop sketches.  I think<br/>39<br/>&gt; is a<br/>&gt; &gt; good trade off between sketching 5th limit stuff and really stiff<br/>&gt; 17 3rd<br/>&gt; &gt; limit.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You&apos;d think 45 would suck with all the inaccuracies, but you<br/>know<br/>&gt; what, the<br/>&gt; &gt; guitar is a magical thing.  Either the tuning is good, or if the<br/>&gt; tuning is<br/>&gt; &gt; bad it makes for a very interesting timbre.  45 is kind of like<br/>19<br/>&gt; with its<br/>&gt; &gt; own distortion built in.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That should be enough to stir your paint for now.  I also use a<br/>few<br/>&gt; &gt; geometric and algebraic temperaments as writing filters.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; Thanks for all this. Very interesting. Yes - I do like 41, and<br/>&gt; somehow my ears tend to favor the &quot;Positive EDOs/<br/>Meantones&quot;, with the<br/>&gt; wide fifth. So many treasures there.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you like 17 ET?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; Yes, very much.  As anything else, a fully fretted metal fret 17<br/>&gt; has a<br/>&gt; &gt; fitting timbre which makes it a lot easier to work with than<br/>&gt; theorize about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L:<br/>&gt; I also dig 17. I&apos;d like to try this on a gitter someday. I&apos;ve tried<br/>&gt; my hand at making some stainless-steel moveable frets,<br/>which work<br/>&gt; rather well - like a sitar sort of, but the guitar is ratty, so I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t do much with it really, although it is a future plan to<br/>improve<br/>&gt; upon this prototype.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; MJ:<br/>&gt; &gt; Anything else, feel free to onslaught again.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Marc<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks for enduring all my questions - appreciate it greatly,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky</p></div><h3>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>2/25/2002 4:47:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;jacky_ligon&quot; &lt;jacky_ligon@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; J:L: Hoping that others won&apos;t mind that I&apos;ve taken the liberty of moving this<br/>&gt; topic to where it belongs, here on MMM, because it was OT where it began on<br/>&gt; Meta.

No caves for you right<br/>&gt; now!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ;  )<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ: Nah seriously I need to get out and start writing again.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: I&apos;m very excited to hear about your upcoming CD!<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: CDsssssssssss.  Well I suppose that would make it more exciting to you<br/>&gt;&gt; wouldn&apos;t it.  Hope so.  Before too long I&apos;ll have a website with ordering<br/>&gt;&gt; information and project information and newsletter subscriptions and updates<br/>&gt;&gt; and announcements and all that good stuff.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: &quot;CDsssssssssss&quot; Gooooood! Let us know when you&apos;ve got it up on the web.<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  I will do.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: Can you tell us all about it?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: It, them, sure, what do you want to know.  All about it hm...  In between<br/>&gt;&gt; trying to revive some pop and progressive projects from the 80s and 90s,<br/>&gt;&gt; well, I&apos;m staying with this pseudo classical stuff for now.  I might have one<br/>&gt;&gt; of the rock albums done by May I don1t know.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; What then:  guitar and midi stuff... microtonal piano sonatas, the mostly<br/>&gt;&gt; electric string quartet no. 2 will be on CD for the premiere in May, I&apos;M ALSO<br/>&gt;&gt; REMIXING NO. 1 HINT HINT, I&apos;m also doing microtonal acoustic string quartets<br/>&gt;&gt; (you know, violins, viola, cello), possibly a few other types of pieces.  I<br/>&gt;&gt; figure I should keep prefacing with &quot;microtonal&quot; so I don&apos;t get asked, of<br/>&gt;&gt; course microtonal, everything I do has meticulous consideration for the pitch<br/>&gt;&gt; time and volume of every note.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I also have some microtonal symphonies brewing too but even though I have my<br/>&gt;&gt; DSP specs down for mixing I&apos;m not sure I have good enough patches.  Invite to<br/>&gt;&gt; anyone... Send me some decent orchestral instrument samples and I&apos;ll get the<br/>&gt;&gt; symphonies done.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Oh yeah and interspersed, I&apos;m doing a lot of Beethoven stuff in different<br/>&gt;&gt; temperaments.  Still not sure why.  Maybe to show how ductile the structures<br/>&gt;&gt; are.  Mozart maybe soon.  Don&apos;t know.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: Wow - what an amazing range of styles! Had no idea. Yes - it can be tough<br/>&gt; to emulate an orchestra with samples. Always ends up sounding like &quot;something<br/>&gt; else&quot; - but I do enjoy this kind of thing very much.<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  Why thank you.  I&apos;ll see what I can do.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: Will these all be solo guitar?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: I can&apos;t see myself doing solo guitar.  Even quartets and such, I always<br/>&gt;&gt; have at least two layers per instrument.  If I did solo guitar it would still<br/>&gt;&gt; probably be double tracked.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: I think mastering a performance for CD allows one to open up &quot;other&quot;<br/>&gt; levels of compositional languages. To me it has as much integrity as playing<br/>&gt; it all live. It&apos;s the &quot;studio as compositional instrument&quot; that appeals to me.<br/>&gt; It can be acoustic or electronic - or both at once. That&apos;s the beauty of it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  I want to hear it again...</p><p>&gt; J:L: To me it has as much integrity as playing it all live.</p><p>MJ:  I want to hear it again...</p><p>&gt; J:L: To me it has as much integrity as playing it all live.</p><p>MJ:  Like I said I finalized my DSP specs so I can get a decent mix that<br/>actually sounds like it was different objects having played in the same room<br/>to begin with.  Well I didn&apos;t really say that.  But I just did.  Personally<br/>I&apos;d usually rather hear studio recordings than live music.  I&apos;d much rather<br/>hear someone in a comfortable professional atmosphere crafting and sculpting<br/>and layering and mixing, than a public appearance.</p><p>With few exceptions.</p><p>I have to admit when I finally finally finally saw Kiss, it wasn&apos;t just the<br/>100db sound blowdrying my hair.  It was a feeling of wait, there&apos;s no vinyl,<br/>there&apos;s no sampling rate.  I&apos;m actually hearing their actual voices and<br/>music with no media in between me and them.</p><p>But then a couple months later I saw the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra try<br/>to play Beethoven&apos;s 9th Symphony.  The HEE HAW that came out of the back<br/>five First Violins by starting early almost had me walk out.  All the first<br/>violins looked like they were off in a daydream of sitting first chair<br/>someday.  The second violins were very smooth though.  The First Oboe was<br/>seasoned and about 70 years old, could have played with London Philharmonic.<br/>I would have loved to suffer through them playing the 5th Symphony just to<br/>hear that five second adagio solo oboe...!  The soprano was pleasing.  The<br/>clarinets sounded worse than midi.  NO volume fluctuation from note to note<br/>or otherwise.  And of all things, I should have kept going when I saw the<br/>notice in the paper for the BASS-BARITONE singing the low part.  He was<br/>horrible.  Every time I&apos;ve said this in the last four years I&apos;ve thought<br/>about it carefully and every time I say it the same way:  I WOULD HAVE<br/>SOUNDED BETTER SINGING IT FROM THE BALCONY!  But they played the whole<br/>second movement with *all* the repeats... Good overall endurance.</p><p>That, to me, was a waste of money though.  I would have much preferred a<br/>high school orchestra where at least everyone was on the same playing level.<br/>I would have even preferred listening to the PORTSMOUTH SINFONIA and taking<br/>them SERIOUSLY!!!!!  I&apos;d much rather have paid that money to get some decent<br/>recordings that would last me for years.  And such is my writing quest.<br/>I&apos;ve never really thought in terms of my music being played live, just<br/>trying to make it so it would fit into someone else&apos;s record collection.<br/>I&apos;d much rather entertain people with little or no budget for music.  I&apos;m<br/>actually looking to charge as little as I can for my music since I&apos;m doing<br/>it all myself start to finish.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: Or will they be ensemble pieces with a group of players?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: That&apos;s a tricky question.  Maybe you can figure out why.  You were on ST<br/>&gt;&gt; for awhile hmm.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Mostly me otherwise.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Well then again, find me some people who actually want to play my music with<br/>&gt;&gt; me and then maybe I&apos;ll have a different answer.  I&apos;m open to it but outside<br/>&gt;&gt; of being cancelled on last minute for the microthon, I don&apos;t know of a lot of<br/>&gt;&gt; people who can do it, at least not in the neighborhood.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: To tell the truth, I find it exceedingly difficult to find musicians to<br/>&gt; collaborate with, because you say &quot;microtones&quot;, and you get that big -   ;  ()<br/>&gt; ???????????????? What-The???? &quot;Look&quot;. Then they go running away.<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  My favorite responses:</p><p>&quot;I tried all the quartertones.  I couldn&apos;t find any I liked.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well first I tried 11.  AAAAGH.  Then I tried 13!!  UUUGH!  I couldn&apos;t<br/>IMAGINE taking even ONE more step in either direction!  14?  10?!  No way.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How can you take something that&apos;s purely MUSICAL, translate it into<br/>something that&apos;s purely MATHEMATICAL, then CHANGE it, and expect it to<br/>translate BACK into MUSIC?!?!?!?!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s the devil right.&quot;<br/>&quot;No, it&apos;s alternative tunings.&quot;<br/>&quot;Huh?&quot;<br/>&quot;You know, like Jimmy Page would sometimes...&quot;<br/>&quot;...oh it&apos;s the devil right.&quot;</p><p>&gt; J:L: I do have one hard-core guy though, but he&apos;s a percussion player. Don&apos;t<br/>&gt; have to worry about any arguing over tunings!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; :  )<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  Well the thing with drummers is, it really doesn&apos;t take them rebuilding<br/>their instruments to find the quantum scale and the inbetween values.  If<br/>they want to play in an off beat proportion, it&apos;s right there.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: Do you over-dub you guitar in recordings?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re asking.  If anything I over and over and over<br/>dub<br/>&gt;&gt; my guitar... I do most of my stuff on an iMac.  I only started really getting<br/>&gt;&gt; to use my TX81z a couple months ago, after having it shuffled between storage<br/>&gt;&gt; spaces for years.  So I still have an old serial Mac outboard midi setup I&apos;m<br/>&gt;&gt; trying to get some use out of.  There are always microtones there, I could<br/>&gt;&gt; never think of it as obsolete.  Umm especially when I&apos;ve never recorded with<br/>&gt;&gt; half of it.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: Interesting! But you know you can only play up to 768 tET with the TX81Z!<br/>&gt; This&apos;ll be a severe limitation I&apos;m imagining! All joking aside - I love the<br/>&gt; &quot;Zs&quot;. Have got two of them.<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  Well you know what.  I was screaming to high hell about the 768 and<br/>1200 grids.  And you know what... If you&apos;re REALLY going to indulge in a<br/>TEMPERAMENT, and not just a couple notes, you really do get some good<br/>separation.  Like I said, I get up to the 27 39 46 41 43 50 45 33 level on a<br/>pretty constant basis, and I compared the values between those and 12 17 19<br/>22 29 31 26... And outside of a few notes that were really really close to<br/>each other anyway, I&apos;d say maybe 98% of the notes of every temperament had<br/>their own unique ID number.  Those things are actually VERY good for getting<br/>your hands dirty with low two digit temperaments.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: What is your style like?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: Yes. ... BAAAAAAAAA ...seriously.  People have said my piano stuff sounds<br/>&gt;&gt; like Rick Wakeman and my guitar stuff sounds like Steve Howe.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; A lot of it is sort of classically inflected jazz rock fusion.  It&apos;s a sortof<br/>&gt;&gt; middle of the road thing, it&apos;s not really pop or classically geared so it<br/>&gt;&gt; winds up being a little bit pleasant to just about anyone.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: This and the above gives me a good idea, and thanks for it.<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  Oh?  :)   And what&apos;s that...</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: Is you music acoustic or electric guitar oriented?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: Not all my music is guitar oriented.  I suppose mostly electric.  Those<br/>&gt;&gt; two words just keep popping up side by side don&apos;t they.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: They just go hand in hand - eh?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ;  )<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  Ouch.  Yeah.  You know what is TOTALLY SAD... I ALWAYS miss the most<br/>obvious joke or implication.  &quot;Mostly Electric&quot;.  You know, after playing<br/>that piece on Nov 11 2000, it took me until I think Feb 2 2002 to realize,<br/>Mostly Electric, although I&apos;d intended it to mean three electric instruments<br/>with an acoustic violin, it PERFECTLY describes the fact that I&apos;m playing<br/>one part and the computer is playing three.  Ehh.  Joke&apos;s on me.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: I&apos;ve read some of your fascinating posts about your fret- boards and<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; such, but never was clear about if they are acoustic or electric guitars.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: I&apos;m in the process of chopping up an acoustic to accept my<br/>interchangeable<br/>&gt;&gt; boards (see below).  Other than that, I&apos;m currently only using electric.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: May I ask if you are a &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;? (You like Strat-tone single coil<br/>&gt; pickups?)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ;  )<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  HMMMM.  Yes that would be my main means of operation.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: When you fret guitars with large ET frettings, say above 31, do you use<br/>a<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; subset from the ET, or do you somehow use *all* of the increments of the ET?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: All.  As I said, up to 217 with playability of each note.  Including 323<br/>&gt;&gt; and 559 which were harder to handle but seemed to work with no buzz.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: Simply one of the most amazing things I&apos;ve heard - I mean read, but<br/>&gt; desire greatly to hear. Are you able to keep the neck at regular scale with<br/>&gt; all these frets?<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  Sure.  Well like I said in the page on Monz&apos; site, after awhile I only<br/>fret up to the octave.  Then only to the fifth.</p><p>&gt;&gt; MJ: I haven&apos;t actually &quot;fretted&quot; a guitar in some time.  I have a guitar<br/>&gt;&gt; ready to accept interchangeable fretboards.  I use plywood.  I start with the<br/>&gt;&gt; smooth surface and rout an ellipticylindrical cavity in between.  I leave a<br/>&gt;&gt; small space on the surface about the same size of a fret, or that is, the<br/>&gt;&gt; same proportion of fret-space to space-in-between.  In a Polish way, I seemed<br/>&gt;&gt; to have discovered a way to yield the desired result:  a smooth fretting<br/>&gt;&gt; surface with each note distinguishable with no change in timbre. It suffices<br/>&gt;&gt; to contrast: the 22 bass I made Fred had buzzes in a few places whereas I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;&gt; never had a problem with a board.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The boards attach to the neck by a bolt around the octave and a little<br/>&gt;&gt; makeshift support around the nut.  Compared to what anyone would have to pay<br/>&gt;&gt; to get a microtonal guitar done &quot;professionally&quot;, if you&apos;re the kind of<br/>&gt;&gt; enthusiast who wants to try any and every temperament you can on guitar...?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; A friend of Steven DiMarzio quoted me $2000 to calibrate his machine to make<br/>&gt;&gt; me a 19 back in the day, and then I should try to make as many guitars as<br/>&gt;&gt; possible because it wouldn&apos;t happen again.  So they&apos;d be like $5000 apiece.<br/>&gt;&gt; I&apos;ve heard up to $1000 for luthiers.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Um piece of plywood cut up and oh by the way I HAVE TO rout boards double<br/>&gt;&gt; sided or they warp.  So... Just by the board space, minus my labor time<br/>&gt;&gt; obviously, it&apos;s hard work but it comes down to about umm 6 temperaments for a<br/>&gt;&gt; dollar.  (I forget not everyone does it this way so I wonder why people have<br/>&gt;&gt; never tried more than a temperament or two.)<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; But of late I&apos;ve thought of making certain scale boards.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: Thanks for this description. It gives me a great window into the kind of<br/>&gt; craftsmanship that you possess - something I can really respect (since I<br/>&gt; tinker with wood and tools on occasion).<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  Hyuk.  Thanks.  Yknow I never thought about it much.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: I&apos;ve found your statements about how certain frettings affect the<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; timbre of the instrument. Can you speak about this a bit?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: EVERY fretting affects the timbre of the instrument.  No two temperaments<br/>&gt;&gt; sound quite the same on the same guitar.  If you know how to pinch a<br/>&gt;&gt; harmonic, it&apos;s related to that.  The different fret positions excite certain<br/>&gt;&gt; frequencies while dampening others.  It sort of teases and encodes each note<br/>&gt;&gt; you have a fret for into the sound of every note, so that no matter where you<br/>&gt;&gt; go melodically, it sounds contiguous.  Filling in the rest of the waveform<br/>&gt;&gt; from this is a unique recursive structure of something along the line of<br/>&gt;&gt; formants, almost the same thing as a vocal pattern, which gives each<br/>&gt;&gt; temperament its own recognizable &quot;voice&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: Makes perfect sense, now that you explain it. This is something that is<br/>&gt; not usually found on a synth - to be sure!<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  I&apos;ve otherwise considered sampling some of the microtonal fretboards,<br/>and then grafting the sound onto a piano or violin for a QuickTime patch.<br/>Either that or just simulating the actual goosebump pattern and tacking it<br/>on as a sort of resonance proportionator.  We&apos;ll see.  But as far as<br/>synthesizing?!  NO WAY.  When you start thinking about the actual duration<br/>of the partial formants or whatever they are, I would think maybe craft the<br/>overriding spikes for the lowest note on the piano or even lower, so that<br/>when it scales properly, the crunch of higher notes will be a lot more<br/>accurate.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: Any advice you could give to a novice about how to learn how to<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; navigate a large ET on a guitar, when they may be coming from the familiar<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; language of a 12 tET fretting?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: Plenty of advice.  Plenty of markings.  Enough so you can find your way<br/>&gt;&gt; around quickly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: Ah - the &quot;secret&quot; is revealed.<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  Okay example.  The primary markings on my 31 board are like this.<br/>The octave has four dots across.<br/>The fourth and fifth have three dots.<br/>The major second and minor seventh have two dots.<br/>The rest of the notes in the 12 scale have one dot.<br/>The rest of the notes in the 19 scale have a &quot;^&quot; or &quot;v&quot;, depending on<br/>whether it&apos;s a quintal or quartal interval.  Actually I have a lot of boards<br/>where the one dots and higher are actually triangles with quartal quintal<br/>orientation.</p><p>And so it goes through all nested diatonic scales.  Makes it very easy to<br/>tell them apart.  Plus I&apos;ve always &quot;seen&quot; colors around temperaments, and I<br/>finally realized that one family of colors was actually a rainbow spread<br/>over the size of certain fifths.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: Do you ever play fretless? Seems to be becoming very popular these<br/>days.<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: Well, not smooth, no.  I did at times in the early 1990s.  But my<br/>&gt;&gt; interchangeable boards are all carved in, there&apos;s nothing built up.  So in a<br/>&gt;&gt; sense, I always play fretless, only sort of scalloped.  It makes a lot more<br/>&gt;&gt; sense to start with a flat surface so your fretting areas are flush.  I&apos;ve<br/>&gt;&gt; thought of routing metal.  Might be heavy but it might have some interesting<br/>&gt;&gt; effects on the timbre.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: At what point of 2/1 puree (high ets), do you find it to become<br/>&gt; &quot;fretless-like&quot;?<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  I&apos;m posting a lot lately.  I wrote a whole bit around this.  All the<br/>people working with me in the early 1990s agreed that the 217 board was<br/>still very individual notes but the 323 was starting to smear.</p><p>We had a joke, &quot;THE TURNING POINT IS 244&quot;, because of the intersection of<br/>different fields suggesting that the turning point is between 240 and 248.</p><p>Again, there&apos;s not just fretted and fretless.  Sliding up and down a 27<br/>sounds like running along a fence with a stick, but 29 sounds like a slide.<br/>Then 41 sounds like a really deep slide but 43 sounds like either a slight<br/>delay or two guitars.</p><p>We called it the &quot;mercy&quot; levels, since after finding so much todo with<br/>additive synergy in temperaments, we applied the so called &quot;perfect&quot;<br/>numbers, gotten from Mersenne primes.  MERSEnne synergY.  And it seemed a<br/>bit merciful that there was qualitative relief to be found in the abyss.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: Do you like distortion, chorus or reverb effects on guitar, or do you<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; feel that effects can obscure the sound of the tuning? Haverstick does some<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; amazing stuff with distort-o micro-guitars on occasion.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: For the most part, I like keeping the guitar sounds clean because I wind<br/>&gt;&gt; up layering them and the combinations are interesting enough.  Anything I&apos;m<br/>&gt;&gt; used to, 17, 19 whatever yeah crank it up.  The only real &quot;effect&quot; I tend to<br/>&gt;&gt; use is a normal recording overdrive, that is, playing loud enough so the<br/>&gt;&gt; input device peaks.  Otherwise, all the usual guitar effects I like applying<br/>&gt;&gt; to 41, moreso 43.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: Fascinating. And makes sense.<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ: Well also remember I discovered that each temperament, even on the same<br/>guitar, has its own timbre.  So it&apos;s like they each have their own effect.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: Do you like nylon strings or metal?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: I used to like playing nylon strings.  I haven&apos;t yet gotten around to<br/>&gt;&gt; having a microtonal interchangeable acoustic.  On the list of things to do<br/>now<br/>&gt;&gt; that I have some domestic stability for the first time in about 10 years.<br/>&gt;&gt; That an an interchangeable 12 string.  I used to have a 12-string 19- tone,<br/>&gt;&gt; metal frets.  SHINGGGGG...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: Now you&apos;re talking! I love the 12 string - like the Towner variety. Would<br/>&gt; be cool to hear this indeed!<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  Yes, now I&apos;m talking.   I&apos;m communicating.  I&apos;m telling people what I<br/>do.  Finally.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: Do you ever use MOS (Myhills Property) - 2 step size tunings as a way<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; of subsetting from large number ETs?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: If you&apos;re talking about two-size-interval scales, sure, all the time.  My<br/>&gt;&gt; markings are mostly extended diatonic scales, with a hint of where harmonics<br/>&gt;&gt; are so I don&apos;t have to carry a manual around just to play an infrequently<br/>&gt;&gt; accessed temperament.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: I like them too, although for me it is usually a keyboard consideration.<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  Actually this is what the fretboard markings are based on, I suppose<br/>you could say.  One is a symptom of the other.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: What are some of your favorite prime number ETs - especially the lower<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; number ones?<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: Favorite PRIMES?  Is this a trick question?  If it is, the answer is 31.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Well I like everything I have... Primes, let&apos;s see.  I go back a long way<br/>&gt;&gt; with 19.  Of course 31.  I really thought a lot more people would be into 29.<br/>&gt;&gt; Seems not so.  I don&apos;t suppose too many people have made the guitar.  I think<br/>&gt;&gt; the discovery is all in the timbre.  I can usually hack the midi with no<br/>&gt;&gt; affection in the timbre, but for something like 23 I think I&apos;d really have to<br/>&gt;&gt; build the board one day.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I shouldn&apos;t really talk now about how much I like 37.  It&apos;s a bit esoteric at<br/>&gt;&gt; this point.  41 and 43 I could play for hours.  Actually when I first heard<br/>&gt;&gt; your music I thought you might like 41.  I like listening to things in 59.<br/>&gt;&gt; 61 has really good 5th limit separation for sketching...<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; I could go on.  You called over 31 &quot;high&quot; though.  Hmm.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Should I anticipate you might want to know non-primes as well...?  It&apos;s a<br/>&gt;&gt; sort of puzzle to make 15 work but rewarding when you do.  Of course I like<br/>&gt;&gt; 22 but it gets me lazy.  26 I don&apos;t use as much as I should.  I have a basic<br/>&gt;&gt; logic grid for 27 that you&apos;ll hear in a lot of my work, especially my first<br/>&gt;&gt; piano sonata.  I used to use 34 a lot for pop sketches.  I think 39 is a good<br/>&gt;&gt; trade off between sketching 5th limit stuff and really stiff 17 3rd limit.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; You&apos;d think 45 would suck with all the inaccuracies, but you know what, the<br/>&gt;&gt; guitar is a magical thing.  Either the tuning is good, or if the tuning is<br/>&gt;&gt; bad it makes for a very interesting timbre.  45 is kind of like 19 with its<br/>&gt;&gt; own distortion built in.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; That should be enough to stir your paint for now.  I also use a few geometric<br/>&gt;&gt; and algebraic temperaments as writing filters.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: Thanks for all this. Very interesting. Yes - I do like 41, and somehow my<br/>&gt; ears tend to favor the &quot;Positive EDOs/ Meantones&quot;, with the wide fifth. So<br/>&gt; many treasures there.<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:   AH HA.  I KNEW IT.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; J:L: Do you like 17 ET?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; MJ: Yes, very much.  As anything else, a fully fretted metal fret 17 has a<br/>&gt;&gt; fitting timbre which makes it a lot easier to work with than theorize about.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt; J:L: I also dig 17. I&apos;d like to try this on a gitter someday. I&apos;ve tried my<br/>&gt; hand at making some stainless-steel moveable frets, which work rather well -<br/>&gt; like a sitar sort of, but the guitar is ratty, so I don&apos;t do much with it<br/>&gt; really, although it is a future plan to improve upon this prototype.<br/>&gt;</p><p>MJ:  Like I said the fretting gives you a timbre that&apos;s conducive to the<br/>temperament.  So as off as most timbres are, you can use the pythagorean<br/>major third in 17 ON A GUITAR, with no problem.  (Psst, you can also use it<br/>in 22 if you&apos;re care - ful.)</p><p>&gt; Thanks for enduring all my questions - appreciate it greatly,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky<br/>&gt;</p><p>Enduring?  Umm I&apos;m at a point in my life where interest from other people<br/>would be considered valuable.  So.

A lot of the whole marking thing is just past the point of being<br/>conscious of what I&apos;m doing audibly, I just find it a little less disturbing<br/>to figure out where I am visually, almost like taking a mental snapshot of<br/>where my fingers are, versus having to stop to figure out how many notes<br/>away from the nearest mile marker I am.</p><p>I didn&apos;t make that clear though.
