Over the years I&apos;ve exchanged CDs and whatnot through the mail<br/>with some of you, but I&apos;ll no longer be at that address, so please<br/>don&apos;t send anything there.</p><p>I&apos;ll keep some of my music online as well as some interviews and few<br/>things I&apos;ve written (like the homage to Ives and the Haverstick<br/>interview). I&apos;m also going to open up a Yahoo email address which I&apos;ll<br/>hopefully have the occasion to check in on from time to time. I&apos;ll<br/>post all these links when I&apos;m sure they&apos;re up and running.</p><p>I&apos;d be less than honest if I didn&apos;t say that I&apos;ve felt a good deal of<br/>frustration over the course of the last four years on these lists. But<br/>there&apos;s also no mistaking that I&apos;ve learned a lot and met some very<br/>fine folks whom I&apos;d be happy to call my friends--thanks to all of you!</p><p>I&apos;ve come to the conclusion, and only lately really, that I honestly<br/>think most of the folks that I&apos;ve repeatedly clashed with here over<br/>the years are folks that I&apos;d get along a lot better with if I knew<br/>them outside of this distortedly, one-dimensional medium. I wish I&apos;d<br/>realized this earlier. (I of course can&apos;t speak for anyone but myself,<br/>but it&apos;s clear to me that this medium, and for that matter the<br/>internet on the whole, is rather dehumanizing... and potentially<br/>seriously so I think. Yes, the list of its virtues could easily go<br/>long into the night, but it&apos;s inorganic and addictive and it seems to<br/>me as though it throws a spookily monochrome blanket over everything<br/>it touches too. No, you can&apos;t stop progress... but you can choose to<br/>try and step out of its way.)</p><p>There are already many incredibly dedicated practitioners who have<br/>cleared out their own areas in this field, and interest in<br/>microtonality seems to be growing all the time. What the lists<br/>probably suffer from most, in my opinion at least, is a stifling and<br/>often times debilitating lack of diversity of input and contribution.</p><p>A concentrated few keep the ball rolling with admirable consistency<br/>and as a result dictate the direction and content of the discourse. So<br/>to all of you out there that are interested, stand up and be<br/>counted... I&apos;m sure there are people here who are dying to get a break<br/>from the regularly scheduled programming!</p><p>take care,</p><p>--Dan Stearns</p></div><h3><a id=3541 href="#3541">ðŸ”—</a>idealordid &#x3C;jeff@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/29/2002 6:32:58 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In MakeMicroMusic@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Sunday will be my last day online, and quite possibly for some time<br/>&gt; too.
