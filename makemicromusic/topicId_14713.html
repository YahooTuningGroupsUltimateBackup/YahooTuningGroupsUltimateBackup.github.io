In rothkamm(TM)&apos;s 3rd installment of<br/>FB02 you will be taken to a secret rooftop stage located between<br/>heaven and earth where discreet mathematical microtonal music is<br/>calculated to interact with the environment.</p><p>Sounds complex? It is, but as easy as watching TV!</p><p>Instead of staring at the tube, you will be outside and experiencing a<br/>360-degree view of the light changing while the sun sets on the Lower<br/>East Side. The narrative is the architecture of New York City itself.<br/>Instead of simple underscores, a complex 100% electronic music space<br/>drama designed for future human beings will be projected from above<br/>and mixed with the urban sounds from below.</p><p>Lecture and Q&amp;A follows. Don&apos;t miss.</p><p>When? September 14, 2006 7:06 PM (Sunset) - 7:39 PM</p><p>Where?
