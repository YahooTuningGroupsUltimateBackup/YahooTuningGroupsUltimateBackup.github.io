I recall that in four<br/>part harmony of the baroque period we see quite often<br/>the tonic of a seventh chord being doubled up and the<br/>fifth ommitted.</p><p>And of course during the entire period meantone was<br/>used, parallel fifths were largely eschewed, wheras<br/>parallel motion by fifths was quite often seen.</p><p>The 9th root of 7:3 tuning is also an example of a<br/>tuning with no fifths, but which can easily form major<br/>and minor triads using sixths instead.</p><p>Thanks again for this enlightening example!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
