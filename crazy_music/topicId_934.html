Carl<br/>does not produce microtonal music and consequently<br/>Carl doesn&apos;t know what he&apos;s talking about.  Carl is a nice<br/>guy and he&apos;s very smart and he has a substantial store<br/>of isolated facts in his head. None of this counts for diddly<br/>when it comes to microtonal music, since music is one of<br/>those activities in which you can only gain meaningful knowledge<br/>by hands-on experience.<br/>    There exist many fields in which simple memorization of<br/>facts or the ability to cleverly manipulate abstractions or<br/>sheer charm count for a lot. For example, in various<br/>fields of pure mathematics, the manipulation of abstractions<br/>surpasses all other issues in importance. In certain other<br/>areas, such as numismatism or philately (coin collecting<br/>and stamp collecting), the ability to hold a stock of isolated<br/>facts in your head counts for a great deal. And in salesmanship<br/>and cult religions and politics, charm and charisma count for<br/>quite a lot.<br/>    But when it comes to music, if you haven&apos;t got hands-on<br/>experience you can&apos;t speak with any significance about the<br/>subject.  In this respect music proves similar to surgery or<br/>automotive repair or currency trading on Wall Street. No matter<br/>how much you think you &quot;know&quot; by absorbing isolated facts,<br/>your so-called &quot;knowledge&quot; remains meaningless without<br/>hands-on experience to back it up.<br/>    For this reason I have not read any of Carl Lumma&apos;s posts<br/>since the third message he posted some time back. Until<br/>Carl Lumma actually produces some microtonal music, I<br/>don&apos;t intend to read any of Carl&apos;s posts, because without<br/>hands-on experience to back them up, Carl&apos;s statements<br/>are meaningless -- they are mere idle speculations floating<br/>free of the earth, like so much swamp gas.<br/>    Why Carl Lumma continues to make posts remains a<br/>mystery. Nothing Carl has to say proves of any significance<br/>until and unless he gets some actual experience in the<br/>subjects he&apos;s talking about, and all the people on this tuing<br/>list who have created microtonal music know that. Does<br/>Carl think he&apos;s going to impress anyone?  How?  Would<br/>someone who memorized &quot;Gray&apos;s Anatomy&quot; impress a<br/>group of surgeons by trying to argue with them about<br/>what a liver is?<br/>    It doesn&apos;t make sense.<br/>    Carl Lumma nad Paul Erlich represent personality<br/>types that our modern Western society produces in<br/>great superlfuity.  Highly intelligent people with a great<br/>stock of declarative knowledge who nonetheless cannot<br/>or do not actually accomplish anything in the field they<br/>purport to demonstrate expertise in.<br/>    &quot;...All this data and information that is so readily<br/>available electronically today does not necessarily<br/>make us better informed or wiser.<br/>    &quot;That is beacuse data and information are merely<br/>ingredients for knowledge, not knowledge itself.<br/>Before they can become useful knowledge, they need<br/>to be absorbed, classified, appropriately applied, then<br/>related into other relevant data and information.&quot;<br/>       &quot;(..) ...knolwedge does not necessarily lead<br/>to wisdom. All of us have in our everyday lives run<br/>across knolwedgeable, well-informed persons who seem<br/>somehow unable to convert their knolwedge ito wisdom.<br/>    &quot;The term &grave;fuzzy-minded&apos; describes that kind of person,<br/>who appears to know just about everything, but who is<br/>unable to apply this knowledge in any useful of practical<br/>way.&quot; [Dileschneider, Robert L, &quot;The Coming Age of<br/>Content and Critical Thinking,&quot; in Vital Speeches of<br/>the Day, July 1 2001, pg. 207]</p><p>    The internet crawls with such people. These folks are<br/>bright, articulate, armed with a vast store of isolated facts,<br/>and they are totally unwable or unwilling to actually create<br/>or produce anything out of all that intelligence and<br/>loquacity and storehouse of factual knowledge.</p><p>    This brings up the important distinction between<br/>delcarative and procedural knowledge.<br/>    Cognitive psychologists over the last 70 years have<br/>belatedly recognized that knowledge comes in two<br/>varieties -- isolated facts (What is the capital of<br/>Kansas?) and knolwedge of procedures (How do<br/>you perform a kidney transplant?).<br/>    Knowledge of isolated facts can be obtained<br/>relatively easily and quickly, while knowledge of how<br/>to perform a procedure takes a very long time and a<br/>great deal of time and effort to attain.<br/>    However, when it comes time to apply these 2<br/>varieties of knowledge to the real world, declarative<br/>knowledge (i.e., isolated facts) prove far more<br/>difficult and take a lot more time and effort to draw<br/>together and relate to the real world than procedural<br/>knowledge.<br/>    A good example of this is memorizing the periodic<br/>table of elements as opposed to learning the way<br/>in which electron orbitals get filled. Learning how<br/>electron orbitals get filled takes a long time, and<br/>involves a lot of deep background knowledge<br/>of chemistry and quantum mechanics and math<br/>and so on.   Memorizing the periodic table of<br/>elements is a rote chore that can be accomplished<br/>in much less time.<br/>    However, when it comes time to answer such<br/>real-world questions as: &quot;Which elements of the<br/>periodic table form ionic bonds and which elements<br/>form covalent bonds, and why?&quot; the person who has<br/>merely memorized the periodic table will find hi/rself<br/>at sea.<br/>    By contrast, someone who has learnt how the<br/>atomic orbitals get filled will be able to figure out<br/>which elements form ionic bonds, and so on. From<br/>these deducations you can make good guesses and<br/>melting and boiling temperatures for the various<br/>elements, band gaps, conductivity, and so on.<br/>    Another example of the difference between<br/>declarative and procedural knowledge involves<br/>someone who has emmorized the flight operations<br/>manual for a 747 as opposed to someone who has<br/>actually flown the aircraft.  Which person would you<br/>rather see sitting in the cockpit on your next transatlantic<br/>flight?<br/>    Unfortuantely the internet thoroughly erases the<br/>visible distinctions between people with declarative<br/>knowledge and no prcoedural knowledge, and people<br/>with actual procedural knowledge.  In person, of course,<br/>we instantly notice the difference -- the person with<br/>procedural knoweldge typically does what s/he talks<br/>about. A surgeon performs surgery, and may discuss<br/>the operation while s/he is performing it -- but performing<br/>the operation is the main thing. Talking about it is<br/>entirely secondary.<br/>    Likewise, a microtonalist with genuine knowledge of<br/>the subject composes microtonal music -- s/he may<br/>discuss it afterwards, but that&apos;s secnodary....actually<br/>making the music is the main thing.<br/>    On the internet, however, we cannot observe people<br/>actually doing things. As a result the vital distinction<br/>twixt declarative and procedural knowledge gets erased,<br/>and there arises the serious problem of what Robert L. Parks<br/>called &quot;false symmetry&quot; in his book &quot;Voodoo Science.&quot;<br/>    &quot;False symmetry&quot; involves a situation in which someone<br/>with genuine expertise in a subject gets sucked into a &quot;debate&quot;<br/>(so-called) with a person who has no standing and no credentials<br/>and no competence in the field.  We often see this on the evening<br/>news -- INVENTOR CREATES PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE!<br/>The &quot;inventor,&quot; who typically has no expertise in physics or<br/>thermodynamics, makes various unsupported claims, and then<br/>a reputable physicist gets interviewed to debunk the claims.<br/>    The problem here is that the TV viewer does not realize that<br/>the physicist has genuine expertise, while the &quot;invetor&quot; is just<br/>a charlatan (or best self-deluded). Instead, the TV viewer merely<br/>sees two people -- one talking head making claims for 30<br/>seconds with the caption INVENTOR under his face, and another<br/>talking head making claims for 30 second with the caption<br/>PHYSICIST under his face.<br/>    The TV viewer shrugs and says,  &quot;Well, gee, I guess there<br/>must be something to that perptual motion technology, if<br/>that Nobel-prize winning scientist had to debate him!&quot;<br/>    The problem is that the unwary onlooker makes the mistake<br/>of assuming that there is some kind of &quot;debate&quot; going on,<br/>when in actual fact there is merely a person without credentials<br/>and without competence whose false claims are being debunked<br/>by a physicist with genuine expertise.<br/>    Competence doesn&apos;t show up visually on TV.  And competence<br/>also doesn&apos;t show up as text on the internet.<br/>    As a result, the intern and TV are both riddled with con artists<br/>and poseurs, dillettanti and self-proclaimed &quot;experts&quot; whose actual<br/>expertise consists of nothing more than the equivalent of reading<br/>a 747 flight operations manual...rather than 5000 hours of hands-on<br/>flight experience.<br/>    because of this chronic problem of &quot;false symmetry&quot; on the<br/>internet (and on TV),  both the internet and television abound with<br/>people who give the illusion of expertise but in fact have none. This<br/>makes TV and the internet absolutely lethal for people searching for<br/>solid relaible knowledge -- particularly people who want to gain<br/>*procedural knowledge* of a subject, as a opposed to mere isolated<br/>facts (that is, declarative knowledge).<br/>    Many websites exist which catalogue some using sets of isolated<br/>facts -- websites about the symptoms of various diseases, for example,<br/>or websites giving the Morse Code for each letter of the alphabet,<br/>etc.<br/>    But there exist no websites which convey solid reliable knowledge<br/>on, say, how to perform a kidney transplant hands-on.<br/>    In the same way, there exist many websites which discuss the facts<br/>surrounding Chopin etudes -- there there exists NO website which<br/>conveys the hands-on knowledge of exactly how to play one.<br/>    The reason for this is that procedural knowledge -- genuine<br/>expertise -- cannot be conveyed by words. It can only be gained by<br/>hands-on experience in a dynamic real-world environment.<br/>    As a result, the internet is a potent means for destroying<br/>procedural knowledge and replacing it with that useless substitute,<br/>delcarative<br/>knowledge.<br/>    This brings us to a comment John Starrett made severa days back.<br/>He mentioned that it proved unexpectedly difficult to describe in<br/>words exactly *how* he composed a piece of music.<br/>    This is the problem we face when we try to convey procedural<br/>knowledge on the internet.  It proves all but impossible. Procedural<br/>knowledge is typically hands-on, context dependent, idiosyncratic,<br/>intuitive, body-centric and non-verbal. By contrast, declarative<br/>knowledge is typically abstract, independent of context, objective,<br/>rational, left-brain-centric and entirely verbal.<br/>    The two forms of knowledge do not interchange easily. A person<br/>can build up a lifetime of detailed expert procedural knowledge, but<br/>may still not be able to verbalize it.  In fact, procedural knolwedge<br/>is often conveyed in s ocial setting non-verbally -- &quot;Watch what I do<br/>and imitate&quot; seems a typical method, or in some cases the teacher<br/>will actually do something &quot;hands-on&quot; with the student, placing the<br/>student&apos;s hands or limbs.  If you&apos;ve ever seen a ballet class you&apos;ll<br/>have seen this gong on constantly (one of my girlfriends used to<br/>take ballet class) -- the teacher will typically say something like,<br/>&quot;No, like this&quot; and actually move the student&apos;s arm or the student&apos;s<br/>leg, or simply do it hi/rself: &quot;See?  LIike this.&quot;<br/>    If you were to sit in a ballet class with a computer and write<br/>down verbatim the verbal instructions used by the abllet teacher and<br/>post them on the internet, you woul get completely worthless<br/>gibberish: &quot;Yes, but more like this.&quot;  &quot;No, like this.&quot;  &quot;More over<br/>here.&quot;  &quot;Yes, but more like that -- see?&quot;<br/>    This is problem we face trying to convey knowledge about<br/>microtonality on the internet.  It is essentially a verbal transcript<br/>of a ballet class.<br/>-------------<br/>--mclaren</p></div>
