I am thinking<br/>relaxation music. Maybe eliminate the arpeggios as they<br/>are too energetic and simply structured. Put it some<br/>sort of pads underneath. Add some sort of acoustic drum<br/>on top -- maybe one of my Bodhrans.</p><p>Make it a lot longer? Same size?<br/>Add sections and development or keep more in the<br/>flowing style?</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/23/2001 10:21:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff,</p><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;X.

Arpeggio section that is inappropriate<br/>&gt;      for a brassy flute, though would be fine on an<br/>&gt;      organ. What do y&apos;all think? Does it mess up<br/>&gt;      the flutiness? Is that a distraction?</p><p>I think it is a good development coming out of the solo. My thought<br/>would be to essentially double the lenghth of the arpeggio section by<br/>a repeat, and a favorite &apos;orchestration&apos; would be to take a<br/>dissimilar but complimentary timbre (plucked string? marimba?<br/>kalimba?) and start doubling the arpeggio, but cross-fade them so the<br/>flute gradually goes away as the other voice comes to the front. Done<br/>subtly, it is a nice transition. Then you&apos;ve set the stage for more<br/>flute solo over the arp.</p><p>&gt;   3. Final section like the first but uses<br/>&gt;      noticeable decay envelope on sounds. I think<br/>&gt;      this is real pretty even if not true to a flute<br/>&gt;      and I think it emphasizes the way this scale can<br/>&gt;      sound quite a bit like a harmonic scale.

Any comments on this section?</p><p>I *really* liked it when all the notes started to pile into a chord<br/>at the end - it moved and shimmered so much I just wanted it to stay<br/>there...which would be a great time to have your hand drum enter as<br/>the chord is static, and then you can see where the piece goes after<br/>that.</p><p>But I like it. Maybe you can find a flute patch with just a little<br/>more legato attack instead of the &apos;chiff&apos; on the note, and that would<br/>add to your &quot;relaxation quality&quot;. But certainly the tuning is very<br/>nice in this; forget guitars: it would be nice to have a flute in<br/>this intonation!</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/24/2001 5:53:52 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff!<br/>    I find it always touchy to talk about another piece, especially<br/>while in progress. After all who am i to tell others what to do   (not<br/>that that was others had done) I am just reluctant. but here it goes.<br/>    I like what your are doing alot. nice rhymic stuff and oriments if i<br/>can call them that. it starts with a pentatonic that shifts out of it<br/>into a broad spectrum and when the appeggioes come in it makes mr thing<br/>that what happened before was a prelude, yet you shift back at the end.<br/>I like how it plays with my expactations and doesn&apos;t do. did what i<br/>exspect. If i was going to develop it i would play off the pentatonic<br/>dissolving idea on different transpositions with the samewith the<br/>arpeggios which at some time you might wish to alchemically combine with<br/>the pentatonic idea with the arpeggios becoming pentatonics arpegges and<br/>/or the melodic contour the basic of appeggiation. Now these are<br/>elements that can to my ear and those which i overlooked you could apply<br/>the same type of treatment. This would be my next step. Is this what you<br/>you had in mine.</p><p>&quot;X. J.
