Defining and<br/>&gt;nurturing a safe space between &quot;inaudible&quot; and &quot;threatening&quot; is a<br/>&gt;psychological imperative.</p><p>Margo, again my sympathies for your challenge.  Your post goes on to<br/>make lemonade out of lemons, which is laudable, yet I&apos;d be happier if<br/>you had fewer lemons to deal with (I have no doubt there&apos;d be a good<br/>supply of lemonade from you regardless!).</p><p>I wish I knew more about the conditions you describe.  I do have a sense<br/>that hearing problems are often paradoxically connected with hearing<br/>sensitivity, so that, for example, people who wear hearing aids are<br/>often on the edge of pain, in not within that realm, when they amplify<br/>sounds in an attempt to hear them clearly.</p><p>My own reaction to loud sounds is to pop in earplugs without hesitation.<br/>If I&apos;m at an over-amplified concert and haven&apos;t brought any, I tear off<br/>a corner of a napkin, wad it up, and stick it in.  Wrong size, just<br/>start again!  This provides only a small relief, but is welcome just<br/>the same.</p><p>For more serious sound relief, I recommend wax earplugs, available at<br/>any pharmacy.  These, unfortunately, do distort the _quality_ of the<br/>sound, tending to favor lower frequencies, but sometimes the tradeoff<br/>might still be worthwhile, if it means being able to attend a concert<br/>that one would otherwise forego.</p><p>Now for a closely-related subject: music with a dynamic range wider than<br/>is convenient.  I&apos;m a big fan of classical music, but find that the<br/>dynamic range of many pieces makes them impractical to hear under<br/>realistic conditions.  This is especially a problem when there is a<br/>large amount of background noise, as, for example, in a car.  To deal<br/>with this, I wrote a program, called Anita (the full name is slightly<br/>off-color: Anita, the Perfect Knob Attendant), which adjusts the volume<br/>of music on the fly.  It&apos;s nothing earth-shattering, just a compressor<br/>program, which does practice look-ahead so that changes in volume aren&apos;t<br/>made suddenly.  It&apos;s really amazing to me how much difference Anita<br/>makes, and how smoothly she does it!  There are a number of works, such<br/>as the William Tell Overture, Ravel&apos;s Left-hand Concerto, etc., which I<br/>listen to _only_ in Anita&apos;d versions, because otherwise there&apos;s no<br/>volume setting that works for me.</p><p>Some day, if I figure out how to &quot;rip&quot; digital music from audio CD&apos;s on<br/>the fly, Anita might be a product available for real-time use.  For now,<br/>she&apos;s a batch program, and it requires some effort to invoke her<br/>(extract .wav files from a CD, Anita them, and burn them back onto a<br/>new CD).</p><p>So the offer I want to make to you, Margo, is to prepare one or more<br/>CD&apos;s for you, of music which otherwise is a problem because of its<br/>dynamic range.  When the music is of a living composer (such as Mary<br/>Ackerley), I&apos;d probably touch base to make sure this wouldn&apos;t be<br/>considered a degradation of the musical message, but other than that<br/>the world is open!  Natch, it&apos;s a given that we won&apos;t use Anita to<br/>circumvent copyright.</p><p>Good luck, Margo, with your challenge!  Please let me know if I can<br/>help.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=436 href="#436">ðŸ”—</a>jstarret@...</h3><span>7/15/2001 9:47:41 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>The last few items on this page link to companies that sell musician&apos;s<br/>earplugs.<br/><a href="http://homepage.tinet.ie/~bclear/clubie/linkstinnitus.html">http://homepage.tinet.ie/~bclear/clubie/linkstinnitus.html</a></p></div><h3><a id=449 href="#449">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>7/15/2001 11:29:50 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>, for example, when leaf blowers are<br/>&gt;being run outside my apartment, the question is how far to carry<br/>this.</p><p>Over the last year I&apos;ve become progressively more sensitive to leaf<br/>blowers to the point where I feel violence is being done as I have no<br/>where to run to evade their assault.

I used to be a telemarketer, and I used *one* foam<br/>earplug for my non-telephone ear, which helped me focus on the person<br/>I was talking with. And yes, my sales/appointments went up when I<br/>discovered that. :-)</p><p>&gt; Now for a closely-related subject: music with a dynamic range wider<br/>than<br/>&gt; is convenient.  I&apos;m a big fan of classical music, but find that the<br/>&gt; dynamic range of many pieces makes them impractical to hear under<br/>&gt; realistic conditions.

I&apos;m a big fan of Shostakovich<br/>Symphonies #4, #11 and #13, and they all have *tremendous* dynamic<br/>range! For example, the version of #13 I have is Sir George Solti<br/>conducting with Sir Anthony Hopkins reading English translations of<br/>the Yevtushenko text. If I turn the volume down to save my ears in<br/>the music, Hopkins is inaudible and if I can hear Hopkins, the music<br/>is beyond the threshold of pain. My CD player does have a compressor<br/>built-in, as do most of the portable Discman types these days. That<br/>seems to do fine on most CDs, but the Solti / Hopkins is beyond its<br/>capabilities. I&apos;ve never needed earplugs at a live Shostakovivh<br/>symphony concert. Go figure :-)<br/>--<br/>M.
