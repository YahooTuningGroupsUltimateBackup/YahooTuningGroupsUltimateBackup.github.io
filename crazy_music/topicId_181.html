This is in Sesquisexta, a 24-note Pythagorean-based system<br/>with two 12-note keyboards a pure 7:6 apart:</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/sesci001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/sesci001.mid</a></p><p>The lowest part moves Eb-F-G-A-B-C#-Eb, concluding an octave higher<br/>than its starting note.</p><p>However one might describe the &quot;geometry&quot; of this example, I hope that<br/>it may bring some enjoyment, and suggest the many shapes that JI music<br/>may take.</p><p>With peace and love for Harry Partch, and for all,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>David J.

Lovely, lovely.  Thank you,<br/>Margo.  Some sequence-like or trope-like melodic material over a<br/>drone between each cadence might make the beginnings of a sweet piece<br/>of music.</p><p>David Finnamore</p></div>
