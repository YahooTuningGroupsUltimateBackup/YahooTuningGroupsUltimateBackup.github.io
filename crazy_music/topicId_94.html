For &quot;generic&quot; Gothic or neo-Gothic music of a<br/>kind I might play in usual 12-note Pythagorean, a milder timbre can<br/>help to give these thirds (especially the major ones, ~423.53 cents)<br/>a &quot;relatively concordant&quot; although unstable quality, as in<br/>Pythagorean.<br/>In this kind of timbre, I can just sit back and play in a usual<br/>medieval style, for example something reminding me of Guillaume de<br/>Machaut, a 14th-century composer.<br/>Here I really wouldn&apos;t speak of such a &quot;generic&quot; piece being specifically &quot;in 17,&quot;<br/>since I might also play it or improvise it in 12-note Pythagorean, or<br/>in 29-tET, or in a tuning with pure 14:11 major thirds (very close to<br/>46-tET), etc.<br/>However, 17 also has distinctive features such as the circle of 17<br/>notes, and the precisely equal neutral thirds.<br/>One friend remarked that these neutral thirds had a &quot;mysterious&quot;<br/>sound, and I agree.<br/>There are also intervals such as &quot;neutral sevenths&quot; or augmented<br/>sixths (e.g. Eb-C#) which can have the same &quot;mysterious&quot; or maybe<br/>&quot;Impressionistic&quot; quality.<br/>It can be fun to take a usual 13th-14th century European progression,<br/>and substitute one or more of these &quot;different&quot; intervals.<br/>It&apos;s a bit like one of those &quot;alternative history&quot; novels where<br/>making a change results in a different line of history; the contrast<br/>between &quot;neutral&quot; intervals and the usual &quot;Pythagorean-like&quot; ones can<br/>add lots of creative possibilities.<br/>One lesson I&apos;ve learned from your beautiful music, Mary, is that a<br/>tuning itself is only one part of a musician&apos;s total vision of a<br/>piece, a vision which emerges in part through the process of<br/>composition or improvisation itself.</p><p>Most appreciatively, with peace and love to all,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=97 href="#97">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>6/3/2001 6:16:15 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Margo</p><p>Thanks for your input.  I have found the notes you wrote to me about<br/>Pythagorean tuning and medieval music extremely helpful, and I have<br/>spent a lot of time listening to them in FTS.  I also have started<br/>doing vocal exercises with the Pythagorean aug4 and dim5.  My voice<br/>teacher, after he got over the horrer of the wolf which he found<br/>immediately, began to feel that there was a quality of openess and<br/>freshness with the microtunings you suggested.</p><p>Here is a question for you.  Do you think the the shift from 81/64 to<br/>5/4 had anything to do with the mindset shift from Medieval to<br/>Renaissance.  Has anyone ever discussed that?</p><p>You may want to answer over in spiritual tuning because I think Jeff<br/>wants to keep this relatively focused on actual music.</p></div><h3><a id=98 href="#98">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>6/3/2001 6:28:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi</p><p>Perusing the big tuning list today I discovered at least two musical<br/>pieces, one by Margo and another by Herman Miller.  there are<br/>probably more (over the last two weeks) but it takes a bit of a<br/>concerted effort to find them in the deluge.</p><p>Do you think it would be appropriate XJ, to ask people who are<br/>sharing musical works to &quot;double post&quot;.  If they gave a little notice<br/>here in this group it would make it easier for those of us who want<br/>to hear everyone&apos;s music to find their stuff, and it certainly would<br/>make it easier to discuss .</p><p>I don&apos;t want to start any list wars or prompt an outpouring of<br/>letters pro or con list multiplicity.  I just want to make it easier<br/>to find microtonal music :-)</p><p>Any thoughts?</p><p>Mary</p></div>
