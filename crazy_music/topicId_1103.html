I did recognize most<br/>of the names you mentioned from my CMJ reading days and have<br/>a few of the CDs you mentioned, I&apos;ll track down some more of<br/>your recommendations.</p><p>You mentioned women in electronic music and in the early 60&apos;s<br/>Columbia studios, there was a woman named Pril Smiley who I<br/>thought did some of the better material. I haven&apos;t found<br/>anything about her since that time.</p><p>Anybody in this practical newsgroup have easy ways to build<br/>flexible fretting systems for someone who already has a<br/>fretless neck? I&apos;m assuming some sort of thick nylon line<br/>and a tightener, hopeflly all hardware store materials,,,</p><p> screw-thingie<br/> sits on upper<br/> side of neck<br/> |        |<br/> |        v<br/> |        O :<br/> |      _/_  :<br/> |     /_/    :<br/> |     /       :<br/> +-&gt;  O         :   &lt;- thick nylon fret goes around neck<br/>      :          :<br/>       :        :<br/>         :    :<br/>           : :</p><p>...basically a capo-per-fret.</p><p>Hope everyone is getting along as well as they can.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
