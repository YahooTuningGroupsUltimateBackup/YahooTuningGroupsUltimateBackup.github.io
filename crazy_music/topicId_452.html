However, has a very interesting<br/>idea to contribute, which is repeated over and over, and the<br/>others eventually take up on it.</p><p>Third movement is a very conventional seeming 4/4 somewhat after style<br/>of Haydn. You&apos;d hardly think that the parallel thirds are actually<br/>11/9s (pretty close) and the cadences are III to I (11/9 taking place<br/>of 3/2) rather than V to I.</p><p>Last movement is in a lyrical 11/4.</p><p>More to come - I&apos;ve taken a couple of days off to do some composing<br/>and plan to do some in a new 11-limit / 13-limit scale I invented with<br/>seven notes and in the Chopi scale.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
