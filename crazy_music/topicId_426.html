J. Scott&quot; &lt;xjscott@...&gt;<br/>&gt;        und Jacky Ligon<br/>&gt;Subject: chris bailey? three thumbs up!</p><p>Thanks X. (?) and Jacky!</p><p>&gt;And it&apos;s not as consonant as before -- maybe Chris has<br/>&gt;.managed to fool the system, to prevent it from tracking<br/>&gt;.his every harmonic move. Perhaps the excitement I hear<br/>&gt;is the conflict between Chris trying to escape the evil<br/>&gt;consonance while John resolutely pursues him,<br/>&gt;desperately trying to make everything smooth! If so,<br/>&gt;maybe Chris isn&apos;t using the tool for what it was<br/>&gt;intended but none of that matters. All that matters is<br/>&gt;that the music is funny and fresh and interesting and a<br/>&gt;real delight! Chris, you took on a difficult challenge,<br/>&gt;one I woud have said was impossible, but you have<br/>&gt;succeeded fabulously!</p><p>Actually, John did two re-tunings before this one, that were more<br/>melodically smooth.  The one I posted was 7-limit, but he had done some<br/>5-limit versions as well.  These were very smooth, they were<br/>nice, but kind of boring from my point of view. . . I wanted something<br/>that really &quot;xenharmonicized&quot; my piece.  So he adjusted the melodic<br/>&quot;springs&quot;  such that horizontally there were nasty little wolfs<br/>and tweaks and what-not in the lines, but vertically, we were getting much<br/>more of those oh-so-yummy crunchy 7th-chords.    Somehow, when you&apos;re<br/>getting those oh-so-yummy crunchy 7th-chords, the &quot;nastiness&quot; in the<br/>melodies seems pretty oh-so-yummy as well.</p><p>But then again, I&apos;m a kook.</p><p>Anyway, thanks to John!  Cool software!</p><p>C Bailey</p><p>***From:  Christopher Bailey******************</p><p><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~chris">http://music.columbia.edu/~chris</a></p><p>**********************************************</p></div>
