As both a JI Moonie<br/>[mclaren post to crazy_music, Sunday, July 15, 2001 12:45 PM (PDT),<br/>Subject: JI moonies and modernist musical Branch Davidians]<br/>and numerologist [my own admission], I must respect the sacred<br/>numbers of the harmonic series up to Schoenberg&apos;s expressed limit<br/>of 13, which was also a sacred number to him. (OK, here I take my<br/>tongue out of cheek... this bit is actually true.)</p><p>After forming four sets of these (four are necessary,<br/>because there are four elements and four directions on<br/>the 2-dimensional surface of the earth, thus respecting<br/>the ancient wisdom of the Sumerians), there are 6 examples<br/>left over, which form a neat additional set of 1, 2 and 3.<br/>These 6 examples form the basic motivic themes for the piece.</p><p>Thus, all the musical examples have been arranged in sets<br/>whose cardinalities express the sacred harmonic numbers of<br/>the holy overtone series.</p><p>At that point, it&apos;s an easy matter to simply assemble<br/>the musical examples one after another in the order in<br/>which they were pulled out of the box, each of the four<br/>sets forming the source material for a section of one of<br/>my compositions, and all of them tied together by use of<br/>the material from the 6 basic examples.</p><p>Of course, since His Ultimate Holiness Arnold Schoenberg<br/>actually composed all of the music himself, my pieces are<br/>all in strict homage to him.</p><p>Hope that helps everyone understand how I work.</p><p>:-P</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
