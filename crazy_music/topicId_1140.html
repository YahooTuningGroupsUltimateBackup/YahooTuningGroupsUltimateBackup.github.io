It is always<br/>important that the harmony would certain principle. By now I already<br/>have a certain feeling that these harmonies do not fit into this<br/>temperament. I need to invent some kinds of signs for these sounds.<br/>Before, when I did not have notes repeat so often in my harmonies, it<br/>was easier. I could indicate everything. But now I feel that in my<br/>harmonies there could result two sounds, for which you &lt;couldn&apos;t<br/>find&gt; (italicized) a different indication. For instance, this ninth<br/>should be &lt;lower than the standard one and much lower&gt;<br/>(italicized)...&apos;</p><p>&apos;It is something like the seventeenth overtone&apos; I said to him.<br/>&apos;Maybe it is something of that sort... I feel that I can find these<br/>sounds in nature, that they &lt;have existed before&gt; (italicized). Just<br/>as the bell-like sounds from the Seventh Sonata...</p><p>Once I have explained briefly to Alexander Nikolayevich about the<br/>theory of overtones and indicated that linear bodies have a simple<br/>harmonic series of overtones, while bodies with width and breadth<br/>already have much more complex series... Alexander Nikolayevich was<br/>greatly interested in this.<br/>&apos;This means that each geometric shape has a corresponding harmonic<br/>system,&apos; he concluded. &apos;So what does this mean? That eachharmony<br/>contains a form, which depicts it - this is &lt;extremely interesting!&gt;<br/>(italicized) It is a bridge between music and geometry...&apos; &quot;</p><p>Second quotation: Scriabin shows Sabaneyev fragments from the music<br/>of the Prefatory Action:</p><p>&quot;He came up to the piano to show me the &apos;new harmonies&apos;, which he had<br/>created. They had an abundance of notes in them, though their basis<br/>was similar to the harmonies of &apos;Prometheus&apos;.<br/>&apos;Here I already need some kind of notation, since I feel that these<br/>are not the usual sounds... Who knows, I might even have to &lt;invent<br/>instruments&gt; (italics)!&apos; he said, almost with a shudder. &apos;I am<br/>thinking of indicating &lt;with numbers&gt; (italics) the signs for raising<br/>the pitches, when they cannot be indicated with sharps and flats. For<br/>instance, if I would need the seventh overtone, I would write the<br/>number 7... What do you think of that?&apos;<br/>I thought that this question of notation was so complex, that it was<br/>not possible to limit oneself merely to numbers. I told him:<br/>&apos;You will first have to conceive your harmonies, Alexander<br/>Nikolayevich, by trying them out on an instrument with the most<br/>sensitive type of temperation, and only then you could creat the<br/>notation for this temperament. Otherwise you would notate something<br/>different from what you need or what you think.&apos;<br/>Alexander Nikolayevich was evidently not satisfied with this<br/>decision. As I understood, he wanted an instant solution to the<br/>problem - this instant and here on the spot - rather than to invent<br/>some kind of new instrument.<br/>&apos;But I do not have any time to wait!&apos; he said impatiently. &apos;I ned to<br/>be able to notate &lt;already now&gt; (italics). I feel here, for instance,<br/>that this sound (he played his new harmonic chord) is higher than G-<br/>sharp and lower than A. So how could I notate it? I &lt;think&gt; (italics)<br/>that this is the eleventh overtone from the pitch D, and I want to<br/>express it as a harmonic note... Isn&apos;t that good?&apos;<br/>I saw that this was &lt;not good&gt; (italics), but his forcefulness was<br/>too swift and that he demanded momentous advice.<br/>&apos;Do you want me to think about it and propose to you a system of<br/>notation?&apos; I said to him.<br/>&apos;That is exactly what I need and very soon... Oh, I would be so<br/>obliged to you, Leonid Leonidovich! You don&apos;t even know, how greatly<br/>this would ease my burden&quot;</p><p>Third quotation: (Next page from the previous quotation.)</p><p>&quot;He looked thoughfully: apparently the question of notating movements<br/>was for him in an even more primitive condition than the question of<br/>notating ultrachromatic sounds. His thought, in all possibility, ran<br/>ahead of the real work - it was clear from the fact that, in all<br/>essence, he did not have any use of the new notation up to the very<br/>end and the sketches for the &apos;Prefatory Action&apos; fit just as perfectly<br/>into our twelve-equal temperament, just like the symphony of gestures<br/>and movements did not go any further in its details than the<br/>condition of the &apos;color symphony&apos; of Prometheus. These were all<br/>glimmerings of thoughts, some kind of unformed projects, but not<br/>realizations. Nevertheless, I have invented for him a notation for<br/>pitches and have demonstrated it for him. The notation was in several<br/>projects: one was based on the 53-noe scale, while the other one was<br/>approximate - quarter-tone. He liked the first project better.<br/>&apos;This is better because it is more exact, and, moreover, I obtain<br/>&lt;pure&gt; (italics) intervals, which is very important... You know, I<br/>think that I could dispense without building a new instrument. I<br/>already know all of these sounds - they already sound for me&apos; he<br/>said &apos;while in violins and in strings you could fixate them, just<br/>like with a voice. It is true, though, that one needs to learn those<br/>for a long time, and to re-educate musicians, but this would be<br/>necessary anyway. I would require a totally different type of<br/>playing. Each musician would be a &lt;participant&gt; (italics) of the<br/>action and not just a musician. They would be required to create<br/>gestures of some kinds. They would need to play occasionally in such<br/>a way, as if feeling each sound, as if &lt;caressing&gt; (italics) it.&apos;<br/>And Alexander Nikolayevich depicted on an imaginary violin, how this<br/>problematic violinist would play, carressing the sounds...<br/>&apos;These tremolando effects, they make up the ultra-chromatic trill -<br/>they would be added here as part of the conception... It seems that<br/>the wind and brass instruments too are capable of intermediary<br/>sounds, trombones definitely, but I think that any wind or brass<br/>instrument could raise minimally and lower pitch... So no new<br/>instruments are necessary at all, especially complex ones. Because<br/>the more complex an instrument is, the less direct in its effect it<br/>is, the more mechanical qualities and rational plan it has and less<br/>mysticism, less &lt;astral quality&gt; (italics). The voice and the violin<br/>are the most perfect instruments&apos; Scriabin unexpectedly concluded,<br/>notwithstanding the fact that he wrote a whole body of literature for<br/>the &apos;rational&apos; instrument, the piano, and not a single piece for<br/>voice or violin.&quot;</p><p>Best,</p><p>Anton</p></div>
