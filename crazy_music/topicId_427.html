Come on - it&apos;s my fantasy.</p><p>[In Spanish:]</p><p>Standing here before you in this corner wearing the<br/>mask of Brutal Disfigurment -- we have the Devil of<br/>Microtonalists himself -- El Jackal!!!</p><p>[Booo! Booo! Hisss!]</p><p>A vicious, psychotic madman -- he ate the ear of his<br/>opponent in his last match! He has cajones of steel and<br/>that&apos;s no joke senors and senoritas -- his very balls<br/>themselves were replaced by prosthetics after they were<br/>bitten off by wild hyenas in wrestling matches he<br/>staged for extra pesos during his campaigns as a<br/>mercenary in the Foreign Legion!!</p><p>[Murmur murmur!]</p><p>Not only that but his big brown organ will shock and<br/>astound you -- it is a reproduction of a beautiful<br/>13th century German instrument with a walnut and pear<br/>keyboard and seven ranks! Do not miss it for only a<br/>small additional payment you can see this wonder of<br/>science in our sideshow parlor (you see the doors there<br/>behind you) after the match! Senors and Senoritas - you<br/>will not be disappointed!! Do not miss this once in a<br/>lifetime opportunity to view the powerful organ itself<br/>tuned to an authentic period temperament!</p><p>[Gasp! Murmur murmur! Excited gabbing and glancing<br/>about!]</p><p>And now -- for the match of the century! Of the<br/>millenium! And likely the next! The world&apos;s most<br/>viciously psychotic opponent -- a man so dangerous he<br/>is to be shot on sight in over seventeen countries! A<br/>man completely oblivious to common decency and to whom<br/>mercy means nothing! Here he is! Our contender! El<br/>Jackal -- Jacky Ligon!</p><p>[Booo! Hissssss! Booo! Hissssss! Shouting and arm<br/>waving! Viva El Jackal! Viva El Jackal! Viva El Jackal!<br/>Shouting and arm waving and jackal sounds from the<br/>audience: &quot;Aiie Aiie Aiie! Yip yip! Aiee Aiie Aiiie!<br/>Yip Yip!&quot;]</p><p>----------</p><p>Thanks Jacky, you gave me a good idea (soon to come).</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
