One I&apos;ve heard<br/>&gt; around my house has learned the cry of the hawk, which I know must<br/>&gt; scare the hell out of all the animals around here - but he has nailed<br/>&gt; that sound to a &quot;t&quot;.</p><p>Here in jolly old Israel we have a blue jay that likes to imitate<br/>other birds. It also imitates cats, which seems like a completely<br/>useless ability, though its funny for us to hear a &apos;Meow&apos; from 50 ft<br/>up a tree.</p><p>We also have a bird that has a song which is either extremely long<br/>or endless. I&apos;ve listened for many minutes and it sings a complicated<br/>melody, then &apos;sort of repeats&apos;, changing one note or sound, then again.<br/>Since the bird also has a full repetoire of trills and buzzes some<br/>the of the variations sound like he&apos;s surprised himself and then<br/>trying to figure out what to do with the new line (like a jazz<br/>player making lemonade out of a lemon).</p><p>Lastly, I heard a story that some species of whale in the Eastern<br/>Pacific had changed their song recently. Apparently, some Indian<br/>Ocean whales had strayed too far East, and so the &apos;Merican<br/>whales copped their song.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Fascinating! Ever try C C# D# E F# G A A#?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Or C D D# F F# G# A B?<br/>&gt;</p><p>Shore, I just call them &apos;the diminished scale&apos; but jazz theorists<br/>differentiate between the two since the first is great for dominant<br/>seventh chords and the second is just great.</p><p>Some think the history of Western music can be summed up as the<br/>history of the leading tone, I think that a history of the diminished<br/>chord may be more appropriate (recognizing that some of the more<br/>used rows of the second Vienese school were for the most part<br/>interpolated diminished chords).</p><p>&gt; I love these octatonics! Especially on the guitar!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I think my whole understanding and appreciation of repeating block<br/>&gt; scales must begin with these two 8 of 12 scales, because of long ago<br/>&gt; integrating them into my guitar languages.</p><p>Yeah, once I &apos;saw&apos; the wide JI diminished chord in your scale,<br/>it harkened back to these sorts of structures. Your scale also<br/>had 16 notes, right? So maybe there is a &quot;stretched quarter-tone<br/>dimished scale&quot; in there...</p><p>HOWEVER, I&apos;d never have found the structure listenning<br/>to the Golden Flute clip! Which goes to show that how one thinks<br/>about the materials and what one does with the materials may<br/>have no apparent relation to each other. (There is nothing wrong<br/>with that, whatever gets one taking the next rung on the ladder<br/>is fine).</p><p>thanks again.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
