Some of these<br/>&gt; were students who balked at sacrificing their creativity<br/>&gt; and imaginations to what they perceived as dead enterprises<br/>&gt; for the sake of academic legitimacy. But others were older; I<br/>&gt; remember especially an established composer in his fifties<br/>&gt; who shed bitter tears he recounted the years he spent writing<br/>&gt; music he himself detested.&quot;  [McClary, Susan, &quot;A Response<br/>&gt; to Linda Dusman,&quot; Perspectives of New Music 32, No.2, 1994,<br/>&gt; pg. 149]</p><p>Bad for them. But their bad luck was not that they sought out<br/>Sch&ouml;nberg in Los Angeles (like John Cage did, composing very<br/>different music)?</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &quot;Trying to write tonal music at a place like Columbia in<br/>&gt; the 1960&apos;s and 70&apos;s was like being a dissident in Prague<br/>&gt; during the same period, with similar professional<br/>&gt; consequences.&quot;   [Beckerman, Michael, &quot;Tonality is Dead, Long<br/>&gt; Live Tonality,&quot; New York Times, 31 July 1994]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &quot;...The Serialists took over academia, insuring that<br/>&gt; their quasi-scientific method, which was ideal for the<br/>&gt; university, as the only one encouraged.

Everyone else was<br/>&gt; shut out, especially...tonal composers.&quot; [Schwarz, K. Robert,<br/>&gt; &quot;In Contemporary Music, a House Still Divided,&quot; in &quot;Notes,&quot;<br/>&gt; (a quarterly index of record reviews from a large number<br/>&gt; of periodicals), January-April 1997]<br/>&gt;</p><p>The &quot;international style&quot; (named, I believe, after the glass, steel,<br/>and concrete trend in architecture emanating from the Bauhaus school<br/>of applied arts - one more of those friggin german things like<br/>expressionism) developed around the time of Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s death from a<br/>fusion of ideas from Anton Webern and Olivier Messiaen among a<br/>couple<br/>of systematically minded composeres like Pierre Boulez, Luigi Nono,<br/>and Karlheinz Stockhausen who shared all them kooky ideas about<br/>&quot;punctual&quot; (pointillistic) music with Karel Goeyvaerts (or<br/>appropriated them from him). Unaware that Milton Babbitt (a &quot;kook&quot;<br/>according to my definition) was already fiddling for a couple of<br/>years with their<br/>&quot;emancipation of the parameters&quot; (a step or two removed from<br/>Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s ideas about pitch relations only).<br/>It turned out that this was considered the thing to do; read: to<br/>compose and to program. BTW, I get the impression that the U.S.<br/>always had a share of tonal, post-romantic composers who were not<br/>blacklisted, whereas in Germany the stylistic break was considered a<br/>part of<br/>reeducation (as the old teachers who could have represented some<br/>continuity were for the most part implicated in Nazi politics - the<br/>young ones developed their own new language).</p><p>&gt;      Klaus Schirmler claims Schoenberg developed his method<br/>&gt; &quot;not in isolation.&quot;<br/>&gt;      So what?<br/>&gt;      The Aum Shin Rikyo cult had plenty of people working<br/>&gt; as a group.  They were still kooks.</p><p>Well, if it&apos;s a cult it&apos;s a movement, whereas &quot;kook&quot; in my mind<br/>denotes a single individual. (What are microtonalists?)</p><p>My point was meant to be that Sch&ouml;nberg &quot;learned his Harmonielehre<br/>from his students&quot;, i.e., there was some consensus (informed, of<br/>course, by the deplorable state of cognitive science at the time)<br/>about its contents when it was written.</p><p>&gt;      They still brewed sarin nerve gas and released it in a<br/>&gt; subway.  They did it as a group. What does that matter?<br/>&gt; The question of whether Schoenberg worked in isolation<br/>&gt; has no bearing on whether or not he was kook.<br/>&gt;      The test of whether a Schoenberg was a kook is whether<br/>&gt; his claims about music hold up under scientific and<br/>&gt; musical scrutiny.  And they don&apos;t.  Schoenberg&apos;s claims<br/>&gt; about the overtone series and about the alleged &quot;evolution&quot;<br/>&gt; of music are pervasively and demonstrably false, as countless<br/>&gt; modern musicologists and composers and music historians<br/>&gt; have pointed out.<br/>&gt;      Schoenberg&apos;s ideas about music are as disproven and<br/>&gt; as dead as Karl Marx&apos;s ideas about economics:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      &quot;Just as Marxist-Leninist thought led to forms of<br/>&gt; government meant to remedy the excesses supposedly caused<br/>&gt; by the exhaustion of capitalism, so Schoenbergian...<br/>&gt; practice was touted as the alternative to a purportedly<br/>&gt; exhausted system called &grave;tonality.&apos; These attempts to<br/>&gt; revolutionize, respectively, our economic and musical<br/>&gt; worlds had several other things in common besides their<br/>&gt; Germanic origin. The application or enactment of both<br/>&gt; ideologies required that their alternatives--and those<br/>&gt; who would support them--be publicly denounced and<br/>&gt; discredited, and a form of double-speak was employed<br/>&gt; in support of these &grave;revolutionary&apos; ideas. The apologists<br/>&gt; writing in &grave;Pravda&apos; held sway in support of a failing<br/>&gt; system in the same way that Herbert Eimert, Milton<br/>&gt; Babbitt, and Charles Wuorinen dominated the pages of<br/>&gt; &grave;Die Reihe&apos;and &grave;Perspectives Of New Music&apos; for many<br/>&gt; years. What is so interesting is the suddenness with<br/>&gt; which these applications of science--some have said<br/>&gt; pseudo-science--to economics and music have been<br/>&gt; rejected and are now seen as...experiments that<br/>&gt; failed because they denied basic human realities:<br/>&gt; economic and cultural diversity in the political<br/>&gt; realm and the necessity for perceptual forms of<br/>&gt; organization and the power of intuitive processes<br/>&gt; in the world of music.&quot; [Appleton, Jon, &quot;Machine<br/>&gt; Songs III: Music in the Service of Science--Science<br/>&gt; in the Service of Music,&quot; Computer Music Journal,<br/>&gt; Vol. 16, No. 3, 1992, pp. 18-19]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      Klaus Schmirler goes on to say:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      &quot;When Schoenberg talked about the &grave;emancipation of the<br/>&gt; dissonance,&apos; he was in fact trying to treat dissonances and<br/>&gt; consonances equal.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;       Yes. And that&apos;s exactly why Schoenberg&apos;s claims and<br/>&gt; ideas fail so badly. As Fred Lerdahl has pointed out in<br/>&gt; &quot;Cognitive Constrains on Musical Composition,&quot; once sensory<br/>&gt; consonance gets ripped free of musical syntax, the music<br/>&gt; becomes audibly incoherent because listeners no longer<br/>&gt; have a way to reliably hear musical organization.  By<br/>&gt; throwing out tonality and discarding established categories<br/>&gt; of sensory consonance, Schoenberg produced complete syntactic<br/>&gt; breakdown.  Without tonality and without traditional categories<br/>&gt; of sensory consonance established by hundreds of years of<br/>&gt; composers&apos; intuition and audience feedback, nothing was left<br/>&gt; to organize music but private codes like serialism.<br/>&gt;       However, private codes are incomprehensible. If someone<br/>&gt; speaks to you in a made-up language with no recognizable human<br/>&gt; syntax, you cannot hope to understand hi/r.  Likewise, if<br/>&gt; someone composes in a private code (like Schoenberg&apos;s failed<br/>&gt; and faulty serialism), the audience cannot hope to recognize<br/>&gt; any musical organization in the piece.<br/>&gt;       As a result, Schoenberg&apos;s music sounds boring and trivial,<br/>&gt; it lacks audible organization, and the audiences hears only<br/>&gt; incoherent spatters of notes and spasmodic random-sounding<br/>&gt; dissonances.<br/>&gt;       This became inevitable as soon as Schoenberg ignorantly<br/>&gt; and foolishly decoupled sensory consonance from music<br/>&gt; syntax.  And he did that by foolishly and ignorantly<br/>&gt; and arrogantly &quot;trying to treat dissonances and<br/>&gt; consonances equal.&quot;</p><p>My problem with some of Sch&ouml;nberg&apos;s works, the early dodecaphonic<br/>ones: The actual melody (expressly marked &quot;Hauptmelodie&quot; in the<br/>scores, so Sch&ouml;nberg seems to have been aware of the problem) is<br/>often totally hidden behind a flurry of sixteenth notes, probably<br/>the incoherent splatters mentioned above. But I have no problem with<br/>the melodies alone, and I have no problem with the whole pieces<br/>before and after the 1920s. Does my opinion count?</p><p>&gt;      Sensory consonance and sensory dissonance (that is,<br/>&gt; rough and smooth intervals) are not equal. They cannot<br/>&gt; be treated as equal. They produce different physiological<br/>&gt; effects.  They excite different regions of the brain.<br/>&gt;     Trying to treat rough intervals as musically equal<br/>&gt; to smooth intervals produces the same effects as if a<br/>&gt; painter were to try to treat every color as the same as<br/>&gt; every other color and every outline as the same as<br/>&gt; every other outline. The result is complete syntactic<br/>&gt; breakdown -- a loss of the hierarchical organization by<br/>&gt; which observers can perceive order.<br/>&gt;     This is as true in music as it is in art.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &quot;An artificial compositional grammar...can have<br/>&gt; a variety of sources -- metaphysical, numerical,<br/>&gt; historical, or whatever. (..)<br/>&gt;     &quot;In the Western tradition the trouble began...<br/>&gt; at the turn of the century. Anything became possible.<br/>&gt; Faced with chaos, composers reacted by inventing their<br/>&gt; own compositional grammars. Within an avant garde<br/>&gt; aesthetic it became possible to believe that one&apos;s<br/>&gt; own new system was the wave of the future. Boulez&apos;s<br/>&gt; generation was the last to believe this. To a<br/>&gt; younger generation these systems have come to<br/>&gt; seem merely arbitrary. The avant-garde has withered<br/>&gt; away, and all methods and styles are available to<br/>&gt; the point of profusion. (..)<br/>&gt;     &quot;It was inevitable...that early attempts at<br/>&gt; artificial [compositional] grammars--say, from the<br/>&gt; 1920s to the 1950s--were defecting in their relation<br/>&gt; to listening. Not enough was known about musical<br/>&gt; cognition; the basic questions had not even been<br/>&gt; framed. (..)</p><p>Consider all these attempts part of framing the questions, if you<br/>want.</p><p>&gt;     &quot;Most of human cognition relies on hierarchical<br/>&gt; structuring (Miller et al. 1960; Simon 1962; Neisser<br/>&gt; 1967). Studies in music psychology have indicated<br/>&gt; that the absence of perceived hierarchy substantially<br/>&gt; reduces the listener&apos;s ability to learn and remember<br/>&gt; structure from musical surfaces (Deutsch 1982). It does<br/>&gt; not suffice for the input organization to be structured<br/>&gt; hierarchically; such in fact is the case [much atonal<br/>&gt; serial music]. It is the relationship to the<br/>&gt; listening grammar that matters.&quot; [Lerdahl, Fred,<br/>&gt; &quot;Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems,&quot; in<br/>&gt; &quot;Generative Processes in Music,&quot; ed. John Sloboda,<br/>&gt; Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1988, pp. 235-239]</p><p>Neither is the better part of John Cage&apos;s music (audibly)<br/>hierarchically structured. It invites a different - and still human<br/>- paradigm of listening that is more passive. Ernst Krenek, who<br/>wrote in all kinds of<br/>styles, referred to it when he wrote (in the early &apos;50s, when he<br/>incorporated total serialism into his techniques, IIRC) something to<br/>the effect that he organizes his material so that it does something<br/>specific at some specific point while leading up to it in a way that<br/>is obviously, but in a &quot;hidden&quot; way, related. Of course, just<br/>listening &quot;passively&quot;, being open to things developing in a way not<br/>understod (or perhaps not being related at all) is not<br/>interesting if you are researching cognition. Modern science may<br/>have its biases and blind spots, too.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;      By foolishly and ignorant trying to treat<br/>&gt; consonance and dissonance as the same, Schoenberg<br/>&gt; destroyed the hierarchical structure of his music<br/>&gt; and removed the relationship of sensory consonance<br/>&gt; with the listening grammar. As a result, serial<br/>&gt; atonal music suffers from an absence of perceived<br/>&gt; perceptual hierarchy, and this in turn largely<br/>&gt; destroys the listener&apos;s ability to recognize<br/>&gt; musical structure from the musical structure.<br/>&gt;     A great deal of research in perception<br/>&gt; and cognition now supports these basic facts<br/>&gt; about human perceptual limitations, and even<br/>&gt; during Schoenberg&apos;s time Wundt and others were<br/>&gt; making pioneering studies which pointed out<br/>&gt; these basic human limitations on cognition and<br/>&gt; perception.  By ignoring these basic human<br/>&gt; limits, Schoenberg proved himself arrogant<br/>&gt; as well as ignorant and incompetent.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Klaus Schmirler makes a false statement when he<br/>&gt; claims:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &quot;Refuting Schoenberg&apos;s purpose by pointing out the<br/>&gt; dissonance of 3/4-tones and the consonance of near-thirds<br/>&gt; is quite beside the point.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Of course it is. That&apos;s why I didn&apos;t say that.<br/>&gt;     What I did was to quote a scholarly citation<br/>&gt; demonstrating that Schoenberg&apos;s method for allegedly<br/>&gt; obtaining the notes of the Western diatonic scale from<br/>&gt; the overtone series doesn&apos;t work. It is self-contradictory<br/>&gt; and incoherent and logically fallacious.<br/>&gt;     If Schoenberg&apos;s method doesn&apos;t work, then he has<br/>&gt; failed to show that the Western diatonic scale<br/>&gt; derives from the overtone series.  And that means<br/>&gt; that Schoenberg can no longer legitimately make an analogy<br/>&gt; between overtones and pitches in the Western scale.<br/>&gt;     With that, Schoenberg&apos;s entire claim about the &quot;emancipation<br/>&gt; of the dissonance&quot; breaks down and collapses, revealed<br/>&gt; as self-contradictory nonsense, since no causal connection can<br/>&gt; be established any longer between the overtone series<br/>&gt; and the pitches of the Western 12-tone scale.<br/>&gt;     Of course many other commentators have pointed this out:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &quot;Many attempts were made during the nineteenth century to<br/>&gt; give to the science of harmony a positive physical foundation by<br/>&gt; demonstrating that the diatonic scale, from which harmony is<br/>&gt; developed, is really a &grave;natural&apos; scale; i.e., that it is a<br/>&gt; selection of tones from the harmonic series. None of these<br/>&gt; attempts was successful.&quot; [Ferguson, Donald N., &quot;A History of<br/>&gt; Musical Thought,&quot; New York: 1935, pg. 475]</p><p>Which doesn&apos;t mean you couldn&apos;t write music based on it. All<br/>artistry is conning if you view it from outside its cultural<br/>framework. Do Bach&apos;s and Messiaen&apos;s music really work as theology?<br/>Are all the works based on fractals really mathematics? If music is<br/>architecture, where&apos;s the roof? If music tells a story, how did<br/>Dukas know about Mickey Mouse?</p><p>Astronomy developing from Astrology is a fine example, Most of the<br/>&quot;astronomers&quot; made their living not as &quot;pure scientists&quot; in white<br/>coats in a laboratory, but as astrologers at some court. And even<br/>if a &quot;gentleman scientist&quot; in the renaissance<br/>decided to watch the stars for their own sake, he had to learn from<br/>astrologers first.</p><p>Isn&apos;t all this tuning talk a bunch of bullwash? I am almost sure<br/>(but scientists aren&apos;t interested in thinking like this, so I am<br/>left alone with my beliefs, kook that I am) that you can make music<br/>very well without tuning anything at all, or without tuning more<br/>than is necessary beyond establishing a same-different dichotomy.</p><p>But:</p><p>If you&apos;d like to make music with others, or if you want to make sure<br/>that you sing a liturgical piece the correct way, you might want to<br/>quantify some aspects of your music a little bit. Whether you do<br/>that by<br/>comparing string lengths, cycles of overtones, or logarithms is very<br/>much a matter of contemporary science. But whether your measuring<br/>implements take their units from eternal truths or last night&apos;s<br/>dream should,<br/>societal acceptance aside, affect the value of the music very<br/>little.</p><p>I wonder what your opinion is on this last bit (but I think it<br/>should go on the Unpractical Wanking List then)</p><p>Klaus</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Klaus Schmirler goes on to claim:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &quot;And what&apos;s wrong with referring to current musical or<br/>&gt; even physical theory? However faulty it was, it had the<br/>&gt; value of being a starting point for Schoenberg&apos;s explorations.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     What&apos;s wrong is that when a person uses the language<br/>&gt; of science and the trappings of science without using<br/>&gt; the methods of science, then that person is practicing<br/>&gt; pseudo-science.<br/>&gt;     Pseudo-science is nothing but a form of con artistry.<br/>&gt; Accordingly Schoenberg was nothing but a con artist, and<br/>&gt; not a very bright one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Klaus Schmirler&apos;s claim is false on its face that<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &quot;...every theory, even Helmholtz&apos;s, is a legitimate theory<br/>&gt; if it can serve as a starting point for its revision&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     According to this logic, astrology served as the starting<br/>&gt; point for astronomy. Therefore astrology is a legitimate<br/>&gt; theory. Therefore we would teach astrology in the universities<br/>&gt; and give university degrees in astrology.<br/>&gt;     Nope.<br/>&gt;     Wrong.<br/>&gt;     Despite the previous failures in logic, Klaus Schmirler makes<br/>&gt; an excellent point when he states:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &quot;But all this should not have any bearing on stylistic value<br/>&gt; judgements which are purely personal and should be treated as such.<br/>&gt; Compare Schoenberg&apos;s music or painting to the music or painting of<br/>&gt; his contemporaries (in Germany/Austria). Is it really the technique<br/>&gt; that turns you off? Is it really Schoenberg&apos;s dilettant ineptitude?<br/>&gt; Or could it be that you don&apos;t like the expressive content?&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      Like most Americans, European expressionism from<br/>&gt; the 1910s and 1920s doesn&apos;t interest me. A view of the world<br/>&gt; as a living hell full of nightmarish horror and meaningless<br/>&gt; chaos may have enchanted European audiences in the 1920s who<br/>&gt; had to live through W W I and its after-effects in Europe,<br/>&gt; but in my experience, expressionism proves unutterably<br/>&gt; boring in music and art. In music it&apos;s nothing but nightmarish<br/>&gt; grotesquerie and non-stop incoherent dissonance, while in<br/>&gt; art, expressionism typically involves splatters of turgid<br/>&gt; dark colors spewed across the canvas with no discernible<br/>&gt; organization, like the remains of a 3-week-old Mafia hit.<br/>&gt; Or, if you prefer, month-old roadkill.<br/>&gt;     Incidentally, auction prices of abstract expressionist<br/>&gt; canvases in America have plummeted since the 1960s. Tom<br/>&gt; Wolfe recently gave a lecture in which he described Picasso<br/>&gt; as &quot;the Beaugerou of the 21st century,&quot; and he&apos;s no doubt<br/>&gt; right. Ugly graceless celebrations of the visually grotesque<br/>&gt; like &quot;Le Mademoiselles D&apos;Avignon&quot; have lost most of their<br/>&gt; appeal, and will soon likely quietly be spirited away to<br/>&gt; a tactful permanent retirement in the back rooms of the<br/>&gt; museums along with the third-rate Watteaus and the fifth-rate<br/>&gt; Cherubinis.<br/>&gt;     In fact, an American TV commercial several years ago<br/>&gt; shows the American attitude toward expressionism.<br/>&gt;     In this American TV commercial, the red screaming<br/>&gt; figure from &quot;The Scream&quot; stands in an animated sunset<br/>&gt; howling silently in horror.  Then a Buick pulls up.<br/>&gt; The howling figure suddenly smiles, whips on a pair of<br/>&gt; sunglasses, and drives off in the Buick into the sunset<br/>&gt; in a landscape which has suddenly turned into bright<br/>&gt; cheerful pastel colors.<br/>&gt;     The animation for this TV commercial was done in the<br/>&gt; style of Edvard Munch&apos;s &quot;The Scream,&quot; and it summarizes<br/>&gt; the American attitude toward expressionism in a nutshell.<br/>&gt;     Other countries do not seem to have shown much<br/>&gt; interest in expressionism either. Musical or artistic<br/>&gt; expressionism does not seem to have made much of<br/>&gt; an impact outside of Germany in the 1920s.<br/>&gt;     In the cinema, expressionism seems to fare much<br/>&gt; better -- as in Robert Wien&apos;s &quot;The Cabinet of Dr.<br/>&gt; Caligari,&quot; Fritz Lang&apos;s &quot;Metropolis,&quot; Cocteau&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;Blood of the Poet&quot; and &quot;The Last Laugh.&quot; (I forget the<br/>&gt; director.)  European expressionist cinema, unlike European<br/>&gt; expressionist art or music, worked as an art form and continues<br/>&gt; to exert an influence in America to this day.  For example, the<br/>&gt; recent American film &quot;Dark City&quot; represents pure German<br/>&gt; expressionism. A fine film, worth seeing if you haven&apos;t.<br/>&gt; ---------<br/>&gt; --mclaren<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:crazy_music-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">crazy_music-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
