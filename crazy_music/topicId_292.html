I know its impossible, but Monz has shown that<br/>even the worst slanders need not be &apos;taken personally&apos;,<br/>you are commended.</p><p>Brian, you are a gifted writer and thinker and I am sure<br/>I speak for many that when you share your wisdom, you are<br/>of remarkable benefit to the community. On the other hand,<br/>do you remember the Star Trek episode where a positive<br/>Jim Kirk and a negative Jim Kirk were stuck in an alternative<br/>universe fighting for eternity? This left our universe with<br/>the mixed Jim Kirk, good and bad, wearing his toupe.</p><p>I don&apos;t wish for any of your &apos;selves&apos; to get stuck in<br/>an alternative universe, and I suppose it is up to us<br/>residents of &quot;our&quot; universe to deal with the positive<br/>Brian Mclaren and the negative Brian Mclaren... and<br/>perhaps your own punishment is for your positive inner<br/>positive Jim Kirk to be routinely skewered by your<br/>inner negative Jim Kirk...</p><p>Enough of that. At Brians suggestion I tried some 7 and<br/>14, I even tried them with my midi guitar (one of the<br/>worst purchases of my life, I quickly abandoned it,<br/>again, for the predictable behavior of the keyboard).</p><p>I can&apos;t say I made as much musical progress with this<br/>tuning as I did with some of the other tunings I&apos;ve<br/>tried lately, and still won&apos;t have anything to &quot;put up<br/>or shut up&quot; in the near future. 7 led me into a &quot;mindless<br/>myxolydian&quot; sort of gestalt, intriqueing that it was<br/>identical on all degrees, but also somewhat pointless due<br/>to that sameness.</p><p>For point of reference, my 12-out-of-14 was 211111121111.</p><p>I noticed one MOS in 14 that I have been intriqued by<br/>in various tunings, LssLssLs. One parsing of this is<br/>as a neutral third scale if LssL is made to be the best<br/>3/2. This is the case with the mapping in<br/>14 of 31131131. An RI interpretation is somewhere<br/>along the lines of</p><p>1/1 7/6 11/9 9/7 3/2 14/9 18/11 21/11</p><p>In the context, the neutral third is<br/>very &apos;major&apos;, with a legitimate &apos;4&apos; and &apos;b3/2&apos;<br/>surrounding it.</p><p>This is very similar to a 31 mapping of this scale<br/>at 72272272. The numbers would NEVER predict this<br/>connection between 14 and 31, except that the numbers<br/>DO predict this connection. [Actually, the connection<br/>is probably through 28... Hmmmm, the truth is out<br/>there, are you willing to look for it Jim? But what<br/>of Lazarus...].</p><p>I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t comment on the music thats been put<br/>up, my downloads have all barfed but I will try harder<br/>over the weekend.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
