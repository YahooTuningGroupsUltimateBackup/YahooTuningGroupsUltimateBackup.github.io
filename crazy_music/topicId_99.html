I mention this for people who<br/>may want to try this progression on synthesizers or the like.</p><p>Now here&apos;s a &quot;different&quot; version, with the accent on _neo_-Gothic,<br/>featuring an augmented sixth or &quot;neutral seventh&quot;:<br/><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/17tet002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/17tet002.mid</a></p><p>We could spell this version as Eb4-G#4-C#5 (about 0-565-1059 cents),<br/>with an augmented sixth in place of the usual major sixth, and also a<br/>colorful augmented third (the same size in 17 as a diminished fifth)<br/>between the lower pair of voices.</p><p>Now here&apos;s another version with that augmented sixth:<br/><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/17tet003.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/17tet003.mid</a></p><p>We could spell this as Eb4-G4-C#5 (about 0-423-1059 cents), with a<br/>tritone between the upper voices.</p><p>Anyway, maybe these examples can make things a bit more concrete.</p><p>Most appreciatively, Margo</p></div><h3>nanom3@...</h3><span>6/3/2001 10:26:36 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Anyway, maybe these examples can make things a bit more concrete.</p><p>They do.  I apprecite them greatly, especially being able to just<br/>flip through them and actually hear the differences.<br/>I like em all with the last piquing my interest the most for what<br/>might follow it in resolving the lower voices.</p><p>Mary</p></div><h3>jpehrson@...</h3><span>6/4/2001 6:13:01 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., MSCHULTER@V... wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/99">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/99</a></p><p>&gt; Hello, there, and here&apos;s a very important addition to my earlier<br/>post about 17-tET: some actual musical examples.</p><p>I just wanted to post a brief comment (although I realize I must keep<br/>my digressions to a minimum) as to how wonderful it is to finally be<br/>able to hear some of the progressions/inventions in neo-Gothic style<br/>with which Marto Schulter has been working...</p><p>I&apos;ve always found her posts interesting, but these &quot;sound<br/>demonstrations&quot; really add a significant dimension which, previously,<br/>had only been in my imagination.  Fortunately, what I *had* been<br/>imagining turns out to be somewhat like the actuality, but it is,<br/>naturally, most valuable to hear the &quot;real thing...&quot;</p><p>Thanks so much again...</p><p>____________ ________ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
