Anyhow, since one<br/>other person is bugging me about not spending more time on microtonal<br/>composition, I feel I need to make a statement.</p><p>Firstly, I just gave Johnny Reinhard John Starrett&apos;s address, so that<br/>Johnny could send John the tapes of my Microthon performances. The<br/>first Microthon was in May &apos;99 and two of the three reviews I&apos;ve seen<br/>of it mention my music: Kyle Gann&apos;s in the Village Voice<br/>(<a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/9922/gann.shtml">http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/9922/gann.shtml</a>) and Joe Monzo&apos;s in<br/>Juxtaposition (<a href="http://www.virtulink.com/immp/jux/AFMM10.htm">http://www.virtulink.com/immp/jux/AFMM10.htm</a>). The<br/>second Microthon was in November &apos;00 and one of my pieces from it was<br/>chosen, along with a handful of others, to be played on a WNYC<br/>broadcast showcasing the event.</p><p>John Starrett, will you please put this material, once you receive it<br/>in the mail, up on the Tuning Punks <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> site? Also, I just<br/>received my three MAD DUXX CDs back from you . . . soon I will let<br/>you know which segments of these &apos;98 improvisations I&apos;d like you to<br/>put up . . . thanks!</p><p>Anyhow, I&apos;ve barely scratched the surface of microtonal composition,<br/>and this is why. I don&apos;t want to put a lot of effort into creating<br/>music that&apos;s merely a demonstration of theoretical concepts, if it<br/>doesn&apos;t have any _magic_ in it. My piece TIBIA, I feel, when<br/>performed well, has magic. When I wrote it, it was not with the kind<br/>of middling inspiration that comes along every day. Years of very<br/>frustrating tinkering at the 22-tET keyboard had to pass before the<br/>feeling of &quot;aah, this is a musical piece that is more than the sum of<br/>its parts&quot; occured.</p><p>For the most part, though, the scales and associated ideas that I<br/>talk about on the tuning list are amenable to a &quot;here&apos;s how it works,<br/>now try composing with it&quot; approach. That&apos;s as far as I usually need<br/>to take it right now, because once I&apos;m done explaining, a superior<br/>composer will probably do a better job of making music with it. Sure,<br/>I could compose endless uninspired exercises in 48 equal<br/>temperaments, 36 linear temperaments, 24 planar temperaments, and 12<br/>just intonation scales, to demonstrate the chord progressions, etc.,<br/>possible in each of them. But would they really constitute &quot;good<br/>music&quot;? Probably not, and I know because I make &quot;good music&quot;. So why<br/>would I spend my time doing this, when a better composer who<br/>understands the ideas could do better, or a computer programmer with<br/>an algorithmic composition tool (think Michael Saunders) could plug<br/>the ideas in and get something out much more quickly? For example,<br/>Steven Rezsutek is a musician who&apos;s been making music with my<br/>decatonic 22-tET system . . . Joseph Pehrson has been composing with<br/>the 21-tone Blackjack scale I discovered . . . Joe Monzo has been<br/>inspired, though in more unpredictable ways, to write music based on<br/>some of the theoretical matters he and I have had exchanges on on the<br/>tuning list . . . It is enough for me to set up the tuning on my<br/>Ensoniq, play around with it until I have a few interesting musical<br/>fragments and a few bases for improvisation, and then I feel<br/>confident that it&apos;s a tuning with potential for an inspired composer<br/>to make good music with, including myself should I someday revisit it<br/>with the right spark of inspiration.</p><p>I&apos;ve been spending the last 13+ years mastering many styles of music,<br/>and finding my own &quot;magic&quot; in each of them, as an improvising<br/>guitarist/keyboardist. Great innovators in music have always mastered<br/>an existing style first. I&apos;m trying to master many styles because I&apos;m<br/>attempting an even larger leap than most of the great innovators --<br/>abandoning the existing tuning system altogether. I improvise because<br/>that is a more direct, spiritual way of communicating with an<br/>audience, and I tend to have a hard time conceptualizing musical form<br/>other than in real time. For an example in the funk/fusion genre, go<br/>to <a href="http://www.mp3.com/StretchBoston">http://www.mp3.com/StretchBoston</a> -- listen, for example, to my<br/>guitar solo in &quot;Spirm&quot; (preferably on real speakers). Completely<br/>spontaneous musical creation. These tunes have evolved in<br/>compositional complexity, slowly but positively, since this December<br/>performance. My playing has evolved as well, in terms of technical<br/>skill, stylistic depth, and of finding my own &quot;voice&quot; . . . but this<br/>example should at least give you a sense that I&apos;m not just sitting<br/>around crunching theory to &quot;avoid&quot; making music, as some have<br/>suggested. And though the guitar is nominally fretted to 12-tET, it<br/>of course produces the full continuum of pitches due to variations of<br/>the intensity and direction of finger pressure, not to mention bends,<br/>and I feel that my fine sense of intonation is put to use constantly<br/>in the course of playing this music.</p><p>I feel that it is important for me to be able to create culturally<br/>relevant music in an existing genre, in which my own musical voice is<br/>expressed, before I move on to uncharted territory. The theory is<br/>going to provide a lot of shortcuts and guideposts in this territory,<br/>and maybe a few dead ends which I&apos;ll have to back up from. But for<br/>the most part it&apos;s a more &quot;spiritual&quot; matter, a combination of<br/>perhaps mystical intuition with a confident musical voice and a<br/>mature sense of what needs to be communicated, which will determine<br/>my level of success in microtonal composition. I&apos;m preparing myself<br/>for this as fully as I can, through various avenues, since the goal<br/>is a difficult one. Few have acheived this goal to my ears -- the<br/>goal of making really convincing, subtle, beautiful music in<br/>alternative tunings -- and none have done so using the<br/>musical &quot;voice&quot; that is developing in my heart, head, and hands.</p><p>I did not express this as well as I would have liked, but I leave<br/>this list now (I&apos;m on plenty of other lists, as I&apos;m sure you all<br/>know) with the plea to let my musical path evolve as it may, and the<br/>promise that the results after 30 or 40 years will be an<br/>_emotionally_ and _culturally_ meaningful body of microtonal music.<br/>I&apos;m not going to toss off a bunch of second-rate music just to<br/>satisfy the whims of Mr. X and Mr. Z . . . I&apos;m a perfectionist, when<br/>it comes to both music and theory . . . for now, I&apos;ll be happy to<br/>debate any tuning issue _on its own merits_ should anyone decide to<br/>descend from the realm of name-calling, misquoting, and logical<br/>whitewashing, over on the original list that is a richer pool of<br/>diverse experiences and knowledge than ever:</p><p><a href="mailto:tuning@yahoogroups.com">tuning@yahoogroups.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=922 href="#922">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2001 6:41:51 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&lt;snip I feel I need to make a statement.<br/>&gt; Firstly, I just gave Johnny Reinhard John Starrett&apos;s address, so<br/>that<br/>&gt; Johnny could send John the tapes of my Microthon performances.

I posted the first chunk of Mad Duxx about 2 weeks ago<br/>on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>, and it is finally approved. As you may know, now that<br/><a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> has to make money in other ways, it is selling a premium<br/>artist service for $20 a month for those who want fast lane approval.<br/>Of course this means those who don&apos;t pay (yours truly!) get slower<br/>approval.
