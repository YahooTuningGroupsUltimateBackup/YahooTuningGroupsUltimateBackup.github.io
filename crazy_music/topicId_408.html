What an amazing quantity of fascinating and<br/>intriguing music Brian has posted this week.</p><p>EXAMPLE1.MP3<br/>EXAMPLE2.MP3<br/>EXAMPLE3.MP3<br/>EXAMPLE4.MP3</p><p>These are really fantastic and I am kicking myself in<br/>the ass right now if you can imagine that for having<br/>missed this concert. Bill and Jeff really do kick ass<br/>there and it&apos;s nice to hear Jonathan Glasier playing<br/>that whacked out weird stuff from the shop. For those<br/>of you who don&apos;t realize it, you can wander into<br/>Jonathan G&apos;s antique and knick-knack shop and he&apos;s got<br/>all these insane instruments he and others have<br/>designed all over the place. Call first to make sure<br/>they&apos;ll be open if visiting Golden Hills. As many of<br/>you know, my girlfriend lived up the street from the<br/>shop so I used to drop by frequently and irritate<br/>Jonathan G. who thought I was a crank and never could<br/>figure out whether I was a microtonalist or a mentally<br/>ill local. Or both, I suppose. But I assure all of you<br/>that I took the MMPI (required when I went overseas to<br/>teach) and am have been certified by a professional as<br/>NOT insane!! I know there are a great many of you who<br/>are wondering. Actually I am kind of wondering how many<br/>of you out there other than myself can PROVE that they<br/>are NOT mentally ill!!! Ha ha !! Please don&apos;t kill me,<br/>it was only a joke!!! Put down the knife please, I said<br/>that I agree with you all that you are perfectly sane!<br/>Yes, that&apos;s right! Easy now!</p><p>And be sure to check out Ivor Darreg&apos;s 1937 electronic<br/>microtonal analog keyboard synthesizer in the curio<br/>shop. It STILL works. Yes, that&apos;s right. I tell you,<br/>Jonathan G. kicks some serious ass! (As did Ivor,<br/>obviously. Ivor makes us all look like a bunch of<br/>pathetic losers!)</p><p>(returning to matter at hand)</p><p>Of course no one told me about the concert at the time<br/>so I will stop kicking myself now. But these examples<br/>are great!</p><p>OK, so we got us some truly ancient controversy about a<br/>bad review associated with the concert and motivating<br/>these postings.</p><p>Alright Brian, you win this one -- Jonathan S.<br/>must of been in a real bad mood that day if that<br/>is what he heard at that concert. Surely he would not<br/>still agree with that review!</p><p>Though I admit that it is -possible- that Brian and<br/>Bill and Glasier and Jeff could have an off night and<br/>just not get it together. That happens too! But these<br/>recordings do not appear to be from such a night!</p><p>You know, mood has a lot to do with it. Sometimes when<br/>I don&apos;t eat properly, I get a real bad attitude and<br/>everything seems like cr*p and everything everyone is<br/>telling me seems like a bunch of utter BS coming from a<br/>bunch of deranged imbeciles. But then I eat some fresh<br/>vegetables free of pesticides and chemicals and have<br/>some nice fresh organic goat&apos;s milk from my goats and<br/>bake up a delicious turnip pie -- yum, just had one of<br/>these last week! And ease off the coffee a bit.... and<br/>I feel a lot better. Sure, they&apos;re still deranged<br/>imbeciles spouting BS but it just doesn&apos;t bother me<br/>anymore! :-)  &lt;= note!</p><p>Any way, this review dispute is long since water under<br/>the bridge. Who cares! That was YEARS ago! Brian wins<br/>this round and let&apos;s move on with our lives now and put<br/>this whole thing behind us and never speak of it again.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
