Since I know that Brian McLaren is quite<br/>knowledgable about Russian microtonality, I thought he, and others,<br/>might enjoy this synopsis....</p><p>Dear Joseph,</p><p>I did some reading of the Protopopoff book yesterday, and I can give<br/>a few insights about it now, which will probably as detailed as it<br/>could get. The reason that Protopopoff brought up the subject of<br/>microtonality in the first place was because he wanted to show that<br/>Yavorsky&apos;s theory is applicable for all types of music - folk music,<br/>tonal (Bach, Chopin, Liszt), chromatic (showing examples chiefly from<br/>late Scriabin, as well as Protopopoff&apos;s own music) and microtonal -<br/>the latter, obviously, having no repertoire as of yet.</p><p>The principle for Yavorsky&apos;s theory in microtonality is the same as<br/>in the standard twelve-equal scale - resolving dissonant tritones<br/>into consonant intervals. As you remember from the article, in<br/>tonal/atonal music, the two important progressions are the dominant<br/>to tonic (B-F resolving to C-E and B-E# resolving into A#-F#) and the<br/>subdominant to tonic (D-A passing through D#-Ab and resolving into E-<br/>G as well as the same thing transposed up or down a tritone).</p><p>In the microtonal realm, there are also dominant and subdominant<br/>intervals resolving to tonics, however microtonal intervals are used.<br/>The principle is very interesting: in the dominant to tonic<br/>resolution, the dissonant interval remains the same: the unchangeable<br/>tritone (the &quot;basis&quot; of all intervals). However, since the<br/>intervallic movement is microtonal, the &quot;consonant&quot; intervals end up<br/>being different from those in the 12-equal scale. In the quarter-tone<br/>realm, the dominant-to-tonic resolution is B-F resolving to C<br/>&lt;quarter-tone flat&gt; - E &lt;quarter-tone sharp), so the result<br/>is a tritone resolving to a perfect fourth. It can also be B &lt;quarter-<br/>tone sharp&gt; - F &lt;quarter-tone sharp&gt; resolving to C-E#. Likewise, the<br/>inversion would be B-E# resolving to B &lt;quarter-tone flat&gt; - F<br/>&lt;quarter-tone sharp&gt;.</p><p>The subdominant to tonic resolution is a bit more complicated - he<br/>has to alter some things to make it zany. The standard progression<br/>would be, for instance D-A &lt;quarter-tone flat&gt; (in between a tritone<br/>and a perfect fifth)passing through D &lt;quarter-tone sharp&gt; and<br/>resolving into Eb-G &lt;quarter-tone sharp&gt; and the inversion,<br/>transposed up or down the tritone is of the same principle.</p><p>As a result, new &quot;modes&quot; are produced - just like in the standard<br/>twelve-note scale several of these dominant and subdominant<br/>progressions produce the &quot;harmonic modes&quot;, likewise<br/>microtonal &quot;harmonic modes&quot; are produced here, for instance: B<br/>&lt;quarter-tone sharp&gt; - F &lt;quarter-tone sharp&gt; resolving to C-E# || C#-<br/>E resolving to D &lt;quarter-tone flat - F &lt;three quarter-tone sharp&gt; ||<br/>D &lt;quarter-tone sharp&gt; - A &lt;quarter-tone flat&gt; resolving to Eb-G# ||<br/>E-Bb resolving to F &lt;quarter-tone flat&gt; - A &lt;quarter-tone sharp&gt;. You<br/>can use this &quot;harmonic mode&quot; to write a whole composition or a<br/>section of a composition. Protopopoff cites eight possible &quot;harmonic<br/>modes&quot;, depending on the configurations of dominant and subdominant<br/>progressions. These can be inturn joined with their tritone<br/>transpositions to produce &quot;double - modes&quot;, each of which would have<br/>an abundance of pitches and relationships betwen &quot;consonant&quot;<br/>and &quot;dissonant&quot; pitches and intervals to produce a harmonically<br/>saturating piece or section of piece.</p><p>Then, Protopopoff applies this principle towards third-tones (18-tone<br/>temperament) where the same principle is used: in the dominant<br/>progression the tritone remains intact, while the &quot;consonant&quot;<br/>interval is altered. Thus, C-Gb would resolve to C &lt;third-tone<br/>sharp&gt; - Gb &lt;third-tone flat&gt;. A subdominant progression would be<br/>more complex: C-Gb &lt;third-tone sharp&gt; would pass through C &lt;third-<br/>tone sharp&gt; - Gb and resolve into D-G &lt;third tone flat&gt;.</p><p>Finally, he applies the principle towards the sixth-tone scale (or the<br/>36-tone temperament). A dominant progression would be C-Gb resolving<br/>to C &lt;sixth-tone sharp&gt; - Gb &lt;sixth tone flat&gt;, while a subdominant<br/>one would be C - G &lt;sixth-tone sharp&gt; passing through C &lt;sixth-tone<br/>sharp&gt; - Gb and resolving into C# &lt;sixth-tone flat&gt; - Gb &lt;sixth-thone<br/>flat&gt;. Now you can build harmonic modes out of these third-tone and<br/>sixth-tone progressions and use them to write microtonal<br/>compositions, which would follow Yavorsky&apos;s theory - just like<br/>Protopopoff&apos;s three Piano Sonatas, being quite adequate musical<br/>compositions in themselves, strictly follow Yavorsky&apos;s theory, as<br/>expressed within the standard 12-note equal temperament.</p><p>--Anton Rovner</p></div>
