There&apos;s tons of superb microtonal<br/>music out there, virtually none of it available on the web.</p><p>[2] Compose microtonal music. Doesn&apos;t matter what tools you use. If<br/>you have even the feeblest scintilla of talent you will compose<br/>excellent music no matter whether you use krummhorns, softsynths,<br/>trained dogs taught to yodel in the 97th root of 3067, or digital<br/>soundfonts made from hamsters duct-taped to the ceiling.</p><p>However history and experience show that most people drawn into the<br/>orbit of microtonality don&apos;t want music. They want words. They want<br/>numbers. You, for example. You keep asking what resources there are<br/>for microtonality. Jeff Scott is a resource for microtonality. Buy his<br/>2 CDs. I just sent off a money order to him -- how about you?</p><p>Ivor Darreg&apos;s microtonal CD on Frog Peak is another resource. Buy it.<br/>Listen to it. William Sethares&apos; two CDs are another resource. Buy &apos;em.<br/>Listen to &apos;em. Kyle Gann&apos;s CD is another resource. Buy it. Listen to<br/>it. Johnny Reinhard&apos;s &quot;Between The Keys&quot; microtonal CD is another<br/>resource. Buy it. Listen to it. Larry Polansky&apos;s microtonal CDs are<br/>another resource. Buy &apos;em. Listen to &apos;em. Bill Wesley&apos;s microtonal CDs<br/>produced with his handmade array instruments are another resource. Buy<br/>&apos;em. Listen to &apos;em. Jeff Stayton&apos;s 5 microtonal CDs are another<br/>resource. Buy &apos;em. Listen to &apos;em. Jonathan Glasier&apos;s microtonal CDs<br/>are another resource. Buy &apos;em. Listen to &apos;em. My 14 CDs of microtonal<br/>music and the 27 CDs put out by the Southern California Microtonal<br/>Group are another resource. Buy &apos;em. Listen to &apos;em. Brink McGoogy&apos;s<br/>microtonal CDs are another resource. Buy &apos;em. Listen to &apos;em. William<br/>Schottsteadt&apos;s microtonal CD &quot;Dinosaur Music&quot; is another resource. Buy<br/>it. Listen to it. Jean Claude Risset&apos;s microtonal CDs are another<br/>resource. Buy &apos;em listen to &apos;em. John Bischoff&apos;s microtonal CDs are<br/>another resource. Buy &apos;em. Listen to &apos;em. Jim Horton&apos;s microtonal CDs<br/>are another resource. Buy &apos;em. Listen to &apos;em. The Wergo Computer Music<br/>series contain a wealth of microtonal computer music. Buy &apos;em. Listen<br/>to &apos;em. Skip LaPlante&apos;s microtonal CDs are another resource. Buy &apos;em.<br/>Listen to &apos;em. Randy Winchester&apos;s microtonal CDs are another resource.<br/>Buy &apos;em. Listen to &apos;em.</p><p>How many of these people have websites?</p><p>Zero. They&apos;re musicians, not web designers. Whenever you find a<br/>website about microtonal music, that&apos;s a sure sign you&apos;re dealing<br/>with somebody who doesn&apos;t compose any. In the real world, the people<br/>who do, don&apos;t talk...and the people who talk, don&apos;t do anything.<br/>Here&apos;s another startling fact: that&apos;s the way it&apos;s always been.<br/>Explains lots of world history, eh?</p><p>How many of the above-named microtonal musicians have sprayed their<br/>music out on the web for free? Try &quot;none.&quot; Or as close to &quot;none&quot; as<br/>makes no difference. They worked hard to produce this music. Why<br/>should they give it away for nothing?  Music seems to be the only<br/>profession where people are expected to give away everything they<br/>create in a Soviet-style collective. Why is that?  I thought the<br/>Soviet Union collapsed. Was I mistaken? I mean, how exactly does this<br/>stuff work in the real world? Do you walk into a restaurant and<br/>proclaim, &quot;Hey, guys, gimme a free meal&quot;?  Do you walk into a<br/>bookstore and tell the cashier, &quot;Y&apos;know, I&apos;d like you to give me some<br/>free books&quot;?  Do you walk into a lawyer&apos;s office and tell him &quot;Gee,<br/>I&apos;ve got a case I&apos;d like you to handle, how about doing it for free&quot;?<br/>Do you phone a plumber adn tell him &quot;My pipes just burst, come on over<br/>and fix &apos;em for free&quot;?</p><p>If not, then why do you expect composers to give away their hard work<br/>for free?  Why should you expect to be able to surf the web and grab a<br/>whole big bunch of free music?  Does it occur to you that it might<br/>cost money to host a website and let people download music?  Does it<br/>cross your mind that perhaps the 40% of the people in our society who<br/>refuse to have anything to do with the net might be the creative<br/>people who aren&apos;t real thrilled about giving away everything they&apos;re<br/>created for free so freeloaders can make compilation CDs for their<br/>girlfriends while watching pirated DiVX movie downloads using cracked<br/>warez?</p><p>Of course you won&apos;t bother to buy Jeff Scott&apos;s CDs or any other CDs.<br/>You want words and numbers. Not music. Go to the Alternative Wanking<br/>List. They&apos;ve got tons of words. Megatons of numbers. Moreover, there<br/>are plenty of off-line resources from the masterminds who moderate the<br/>Alternative Wanking List. For example, you can buy Carl Lumma&apos;s superb<br/>CD of microtonal music here:</p><p>That&apos;s right, Carl Lumma hasn&apos;t produced a CD of microtonal music. But<br/>he&apos;s spewed out millions of words. At least that&apos;s something. You can<br/>peruse gems like Carls&apos; memorable claim &quot;I&apos;ve never made a mistake.&quot;<br/>How&apos;s that for wisdom?  Puts Socrates to shame, don&apos;t it?  Wait,<br/>though -- you could also go here to find Paul Erlich&apos;s great CD of<br/>microtonal music:</p><p>That&apos;s right, Paul Erlich hasn&apos;t released any CDs of microtonal music<br/>either. But why let that stop you?  Erlich has vomited out millions of<br/>words. Go read &apos;em, then stick your head in a car-crushing machine and<br/>chant &quot;I am wise, I have attained the knowledge of the ages!&quot;  Or you<br/>could always listen to that magnificent CD of microtonal music by<br/>Jonathan Szanto available here:</p><p>Whoops, Jonathan Szanto hasn&apos;t released any CDs of microtonal music<br/>either. But don&apos;t worry, he sprays out tens of thousands of words per<br/>week, so all is not lost. Szanto has immeasurably contributed to<br/>microtonality with posts like his recent comment &quot;It sounds<br/>like a root canal without anaesthetic.&quot;  Yes, you can always count on<br/>Joanthan Szanto to contribute to microtonality with invaluable<br/>passages like that one. And don&apos;t forget that supreme genius of<br/>microtonality Joe Monzo. Joe&apos;s excellent CD of microtonal music can be<br/>found here:</p><p>Yes, Joe Monzo hasn&apos;t released any CDs of microtonal music either.<br/>But, hey! What does *that* matter when he has so many spiffy words and<br/>numbers and diagrams on his website?  Everybody&apos;s got a website. And<br/>the nuggets of knowledge you&apos;ll find there are just unspeakable, it&apos;s<br/>enough to make wildebeests spontaneously combust. You can pore over<br/>Joe Monzo&apos;s lattice diagrams while whacking roofing nails into your<br/>hand and gargling with hydrofluoric acid. Then pause to congratulate<br/>yourself on how wonderful it is, and how much these activities have<br/>enhanced your life.</p><p>And last but far from least, there&apos;s Gene Ward Smith -- he has made<br/>vast contributions to microtonailty, including this memorable recent<br/>post just a few days back on the MetaMusic forum (a group devoted to<br/>discussing the Alternative Tuning List):</p><p>&gt;Message 6895 of 6940  |  Previous | Next  [ Up Thread ]  Message<br/>Index</p><p>&gt;From:  &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>&gt;Date:  Fri Mar 12, 2004  10:56 am<br/>&gt;Subject:  Tuning community?</p><p>&gt;Do we have one? Lately it seems to me I see more &quot;sharing&quot; of insults<br/>&gt;and hurt feelings than of insights and music. I&apos;m finishing up a new<br/>&gt;piece, and wondering if there is any point to this. Will it make<br/>&gt;anyone the least bit happier? Will the ideas involved wither and die?<br/>&gt;Are we talking to each other, or simply shouting &quot;fuck you!&quot; as our<br/>&gt;separate vehicles whizz by each other in the dark?</p><p>Just makes you want to jump up and compose microtnal music, doesn&apos;t<br/>it?  And not only that -- Gene has actually released CDs of music.<br/>Alas, not microtonal. They sound like Beethoven on a bad day played on<br/>a piano that hasn&apos;t been tuned since the Nixon administration. 12<br/>pitches in the octave only.  But why worry about that?  Gene has<br/>spewed out a veritable orgy of numbers and diagrams, and best of all,<br/>jargon. Why, Gene has jargon that will strip paint from your walls.<br/>It&apos;ll make you lick doorknobs. You&apos;ll wind up chewing garden hoses<br/>after reading Gene&apos;s jargon at <a href="http://www.xenharmony.org">www.xenharmony.org</a>.  Of course, if you<br/>want some actual evidence that any of Gene&apos;s jargon has any<br/>objectively verifiable connection with observed reality...welllllll,<br/>you&apos;re just trying to destroy everything this great mastermind has<br/>created. Shame on you. Gene Ward Smith stands right up there with Uri<br/>Geller and L. Ron Hubbard, a great great mind. Spiffy dresser too.</p><p>When dealing with googlebabies like Jacob Barton, we have to realize<br/>it&apos;s their world and we just live in it. The net is the only valid<br/>source of knowledge. Makes sense. It&apos;s the digital age. Books are<br/>obsolete. The www is the collective brain of mankind! After all,<br/>whatever some pimple-faced 14-year-old types into the internet while<br/>searching for new blood spatter patterns for his Duke Nuke &apos;Em game<br/>must be the source of all wisdom, right?</p><p>What possible purpose could libraries serve?  We live in the online<br/>era. Hallelujah! It&apos;s a brand new hyperlinked streaming downloadable<br/>world, full of incredible new resources like the invaluable forty laws<br/>of Sympathetic Vibratory Physics at<br/><a href="http://www.svpvril.com/fortylaw.html">http://www.svpvril.com/fortylaw.html</a></p><p>and the fascinating details about the harmonic world-grid which draws<br/>all those UFOs into close contact at<br/><a href="http://www.worldhistoryhub.com/The_Energy_Grid_0932813445.html">http://www.worldhistoryhub.com/The_Energy_Grid_0932813445.html</a></p><p>What sublime insight we gain by surfing the net and discovering new<br/>breathtaking revelations about the quantum nature of Bigfoot<br/><a href="http://www.unknowncountry.com/news/?id=3178">http://www.unknowncountry.com/news/?id=3178</a></p><p>and the startling truth that Satan actually pilots those pesky saucers<br/>hovering over the Bermuda Triangle:<br/><a href="http://www.pharo.com/ufos/satanic_hypothesis/artic">http://www.pharo.com/ufos/satanic_hypothesis/artic</a><br/>les/ufss_00a_satanic.asp</p><p>After all, can you find any of this information in your local<br/>university library?</p><p>Gosh. Makes you think, doesn&apos;t it?</p><p>Best of all, the net doesn&apos;t suffer from any of that nasty icky<br/>elitism we find in those hidebound scholarly journals. Those stuffy<br/>old fogeys actually demand hard evidence for a claim before they let<br/>it into print. The internet offers a vastly superior shortcut to<br/>knowledge. Whatever anyone says is true...just because they say it.<br/>Isn&apos;t that marvellous?  All the hard work gets taken out of education<br/>-- just surf the net, and believe whatever you read, and, why, gosh,<br/>the next thing you know, you&apos;ll have attained an apex of wisdom<br/>scarcely equalled since those Heavens Gate cult members castrated<br/>themselves and gobbled a bunch of barbiturate-laced oatmeal.</p><p>On the other hand, if you&apos;ve backslid out of the firm conviction that<br/>the internet contains valid information, you might be ready for a<br/>change. Perhaps you&apos;re no longer quite so cocksure that the internet<br/>is THE place to go to get all those wonderful different &quot;perspectives&quot;<br/>on various subjects -- like, oh, say, the perspective that 2 + 2 = 3,<br/>or the alternative and quite recherche perspective that 2 + 2 = 7, or<br/>the even more daring and provocative perspective that 2 + 2 = -5. Then<br/>you might find yourself desirous of *genuine* words of wisdom.  In<br/>that case, try these by Jeff Scott:</p><p>&quot;Many have compared the experience of listening [to microtnal music]<br/>to that of being in another world. Even so, it has not disturbed the<br/>very conservative persons, yet it has blown the minds of the extremely<br/>avant-garde. Beautiful, bizarre, elegant, weird, energizing and<br/>relaxing are all words that have been used to describe this music.</p><p>&quot;This album should not be possible either technically or in terms of<br/>traditional theories and beliefs about the nature of music and<br/>hearing: Six of the ten pieces use nonoctave tunings. For persons<br/>curious about what is possible with nonoctave tunings, this will<br/>certainly be of special interest.&quot;</p><p>But you don&apos;t want facts, Jacob. You don&apos;t want logic. You don&apos;t want<br/>critical thinking. You don&apos;t want to listen to CDs of microtonal<br/>music. You just want to surf the net.</p><p>&quot;The only real problem is that anyone who has no culture, other than<br/>this global monoculture, is completely screwed. Anyone who grows up<br/>watching TV, never sees any religion or philosophy, is raised in an<br/>atmosphere of moral relativism, learns about civics from watching<br/>bimbo eruptions on network TV news, and attends a university where<br/>postmodernists vie to outdo each other in demolishing traditional<br/>notions of truth and quality, is going to come out into the world as<br/>one pretty feckless human being.&quot; [Stephenson, Neal, &quot;In the Beginning<br/>Was the Command Line, 2001]</p></div><h3><a id=1264 href="#1264">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/26/2004 11:51:49 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:crazy_music@yahoogroups.com">crazy_music@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;xenharmonic&quot; &lt;xed@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; To add to what Jeff Scott said, Jacob, here&apos;s what you need to do:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; [1] Support microtonal composers and microtonal music by buying their<br/>&gt; CDs and listening to their music.
