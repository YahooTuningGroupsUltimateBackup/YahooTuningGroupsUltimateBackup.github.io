The<br/>earliest non-realtime tuning methods that I posted, from about August<br/>1999 to January 2000, specified exact JI vertical intervals and had<br/>fairly poor drift management (compared to the spring model), which<br/>caused a fair amount of short-term drift in overall tuning, that had to<br/>be recovered fairly quickly and noticeably.  You are one of the few who<br/>has said he prefers this treatment to the later, much more smooth,<br/>spring model&apos;s output.</p><p>I&apos;m going to run a test right now to see if that option still works - it<br/>does!  In my &quot;comma pump&quot; sequence, tuning is driven down to almost 70<br/>cents below nominal, highly noticeable (though it takes several times<br/>around the pump to happen, as you&apos;d expect).</p><p>Here&apos;s what I&apos;m curious about: can your desire for more motion be<br/>satisfied using the spring model, but very rigid vertical springs and<br/>much softer horizontal and/or grounding springs?  I still _do_ have<br/>problems relaxing the spring matrix when the ratios of stiffness get<br/>extreme, but can achieve results within a cent or two of exact JI, which<br/>I _think_ should sound vertically pretty good.  It&apos;s not at all clear,<br/>though, whether that would leave enough of that bouncy horizontal motion<br/>to satisfy you.</p><p>Don&apos;t know if you&apos;d have time or interest, but I&apos;d like to do up two<br/>or three tunings of some piece, including one pre-spring, to see where<br/>the edge of your desire lies.

Pure comma pump could mean very loose<br/>grounding springs, allowing a lot of drift either up or down.

When I wrote back thanking him and admitting<br/>that I don&apos;t know who d&apos;Alembert is/was, he wrote back suggesting that<br/>I stick with modern instruments, without, however, withdrawing his<br/>permission.</p><p>So, I have extracted the Scarlatti K051 sequence and posted several<br/>options.  The original sequence has the following tuning, in cents<br/>relative to 12-tET:</p><p>   G#/Ab 8: E8 00 3C (-12.50)<br/>   D#/Eb 3: E3 1F 3D  (-8.62)<br/>   A#/Bb A: EB 30 3E  (-5.08)<br/>   F     5: E5 30 3F  (-1.95)<br/>   C     0: E0 00 40   (0.00)<br/>   G     7: E7 7E 3E  (-3.17)<br/>   D     2: E2 70 3D  (-6.64)<br/>   A     9: EA 30 3C (-11.33)<br/>   E     4: E4 50 3B (-13.67)<br/>   B     B: EC 57 3B (-13.50)<br/>   F#/Gb 6: E6 0F 3B (-15.26)<br/>   C#/Db 1: E1 32 3B (-14.40)</p><p>Whew!  I&apos;d have to let Mr. Sankey explain that tuning set; it&apos;s not what<br/>I&apos;d pick.  I first made a 12-tET version, then tuned that in various<br/>ways.  John Starrett, did you want anything 5-limit?

With a few hand tweaks, dr7 would no longer be funny, but a<br/>really interesting serious tuning choice. Truth is, if I had to choose<br/>one tuning (with which I am familiar) to hear this piece in for the<br/>rest of my life, I would choose Sankey&apos;s. Nevertheless is it great to<br/>hear these experiments.<br/>Yes, I would like to hear the five limit versions.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
