The last 4 years, I have spent as an activist for peace and human rights (especially refugees and asylum seekers) on the Internet; I&apos;m also books author and ebooks publisher. I have launched many campaigns to improve our situation as refugees in Lebanon and hopefully bring more understanding to our problems worldwide. I helped make many changes and improvements at the UNHCR office in Beirut; I used the Internet as the field for my activities (you can read more about that in my free ebook &apos;MY CAMPAIGNS&apos;). All my ebooks are free and could be download from my sites.</p><p>This is my newest campaign, it&apos;s about the illegal and humiliating actions of the UNHCR, who using photos of refugees as banners and human-buttons to collect money. This is an abuse of the dignity and humanity of the refugees and must stop immediately and a clear public apology present by The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. My friends, I am talking about the pictures you can see here:<br/><a href="http://www.tbns.net/un77/human-buttons.htm">http://www.tbns.net/un77/human-buttons.htm</a></p><p>Where you can read the rest of this message as web page.</p><p>Also you can read my new campaign &apos;Urgent, we need smile&apos; here:<br/><a href="http://sitepalace.com/lebanon/smile.html">http://sitepalace.com/lebanon/smile.html</a></p><p>For more info about UNHCR and life of refugees you can read my free ebooks.
