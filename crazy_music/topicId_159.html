The whole Sethares thing<br/>&gt; started because I was trying to duplicate the One-Footed Bride. But when I<br/>&gt; plotted the curve, I found consonances -- sharp valleys -- only at the<br/>&gt; following intervals: 1/1, 7/6, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 5/3, 7/4 and of<br/>&gt; course 2/1. What is interesting is that the One-Footed Bride includes all of<br/>&gt; these as consonances, but it *also* includes their *complements*: 12/7, 8/5,<br/>&gt; 10/7 and 8/7 in addition to the ones listed. These last four *don&apos;t* show as<br/>&gt; consonances on the Sethares curve. And there&apos;s nary a 9 or 11 to be found<br/>&gt; amongst the Sethares consonances. So I am dying to hear what the other<br/>&gt; Partch intervals sound like!</p><p>Thank goodness all the lists are scattered. I take it you&apos;ve looked at<br/>the information on the harmonic entropy list where developing and<br/>discussing those curves is the raison d^etre? Of course, it may have<br/>merged with the tuning-math list... In either case, there may<br/>be some computationally oriented folks at those places who may provide<br/>additional help and aren&apos;t on this list.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=160 href="#160">ðŸ”—</a>M.

I have the Matlab<br/>code for HE and at some point, as a means of understanding it, will translate<br/>it into Derive and compare it on a mathematical basis with the Sethares curve<br/>and possibly, if I can find some musically naive listeners, compare intervals<br/>where one predicts consonance and the other does not, if such consonances in<br/>fact exist. For now, the Sethares measure is one I understand and can easily<br/>implement in Derive and SAOL, and one which will work for any timbre and<br/>intervals I can throw at it.</p><p>&gt; Of course, it may have<br/>&gt; merged with the tuning-math list...</p><p>&apos;Nutha smiley :-). Let&apos;s just say that tuning folk seem to be passionate about<br/>a lot of things. My original question was whether what I call the &quot;Partch<br/>System&quot; -- not just the 43-degree scale but the whole set of concepts laid out<br/>in _Genesis of a Music_ had been mechanized in any way. Several folks pointed me<br/>to Prent Rodgers, who indeed has done quite a bit of work in this area.<br/>However, his paths and mine diverge in a number of areas, and his code, though<br/>posted on his web site, is not something easily maintainable. My code will be<br/>more easily maintainable, I hope -- certainly it will be for me. :-) All I<br/>was really interested in was whether tools were available or whether I needed<br/>to build them.</p><p>&gt; In either case, there may<br/>&gt; be some computationally oriented folks at those places who may provide<br/>&gt; additional help and aren&apos;t on this list.</p><p>I&apos;m amazingly self-sufficient in mathematics, statistics and scientific<br/>computing. :-) If a tool had existed that was *easily* adapted to my purposes,<br/>I would have jumped on it. It doesn&apos;t, so I will build it, and if there is a<br/>market for it, I will sell it at a reasonable price, on the order of what<br/>Robert Walker charges for Fractal Tune Smithy, $20US. If there&apos;s no market,<br/>I&apos;ll just give it away.</p><p>One more note: I&apos;ve said this repeatedly on the main tuning list and I&apos;ll say<br/>it here now. My own personal opinion is that there are too many specialized<br/>lists on this subject -- microtonality -- and that I believe every effort<br/>should be made to keep the wars and such under control on the *main* list,<br/>rather than spinning off a new list every time two people disagree about<br/>something and get a little passionate about it. If that means a moderator has<br/>to *temporarily* ban someone who is being an asshole, fine, but permanent bans,<br/>separate lists for arguments, games of mathematicians vs. composers, etc., are<br/>things that discourage me and things I&apos;d like to discourage whenever possible.</p><p>I could have just started my own list, dedicated to the Partch system of<br/>Monophony, and invited folks from all the lists to join. I don&apos;t see the point<br/>in that; if someone wants to do it, I&apos;ll join and, if it&apos;s not active enough<br/>for me, I&apos;ll drop out.<br/>--<br/>znmeb@... (M.
