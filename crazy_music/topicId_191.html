The<br/>list of ETs with your comments (and hopefully additions from<br/>others with much more experience than I have) is going to be<br/>a real &apos;thought provoker&apos; as I go through my inspections.</p><p>Let me introduce myself first. I probably fall into the<br/>&apos;theory wanker from the ATL&apos; category by your standards.<br/>My music endeavors in the real world are fairly<br/>modern jazz guitar composition and performance nominally<br/>in 12 equal (I say nominally because I bend a lot of<br/>notes and most playing situations are barely<br/>&quot;in tune&quot;). My microtonal explorations at this point<br/>are twiddling with various scales and tunings in my own<br/>private midi studio hell (with no compositions committed<br/>yet) and I am soon going to get a 31ED2 guitar.</p><p>Regarding your 17 comments...</p><p>&gt;     Although various so-called &quot;theorists&quot; (none of whom<br/>&gt; have actually composed in the tunings they puport to<br/>&gt; discuss) have described 17 equal as an &quot;ultra-Pythagorean&quot;<br/>&gt; tuning, this captures only &quot;the one-half part of the one<br/>&gt; fourth truth,&quot; to coin a phrase. When used to ape 12-equal<br/>&gt; Pythagorean major and minor melodic modes and major and<br/>&gt; minor triadic harmonies, 17 equal can indeed sound like a<br/>&gt; Pythagorean tuning carried to extremes -- restless, vibrant,<br/>&gt; aggressive, steely, and biased toward melody rather than<br/>&gt; harmony.</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p><p>&gt;    Howver, the striking fact remains that most composers who<br/>&gt; use 17 equal find themselves quickly falling into the habit<br/>&gt; of using a highly gapped pentatonic melodic mode.<br/>&gt;    This tendency for 17 equal to fall into a pentatonic mode<br/>&gt; has shown itself so often, in the hands of so many<br/>&gt; microtonalists (novices and seasoned veterans alike) that<br/>&gt; the 17-equal predeliction for a gapped pentatonic mode must<br/>&gt; qualify as the signle most notable characteristic of the<br/>&gt; 17 equal tuning. No mathematics predicted this. No theory<br/>&gt; explains it.</p><p>My &quot;cursory glance at 5 and 7 note MOSes in 17 equal&quot;<br/>show the obvious</p><p>51515    &lt;- is this the gapped penatonic you mentioned?<br/>34343<br/>3313331  &lt;- the &quot;psuedo-pythagorean&quot; with &quot;restless&quot; 9/7 thirds<br/>3223232  &lt;- a neutral diatonic</p><p>If indeed the 51 pentatonic is the one that you have seen<br/>people gravitate towards, then you are correct that there<br/>is not an obvious &quot;consonance&quot; motivated reason to choose<br/>that over 343434, which would be the &quot;ultra-Pythagorean&quot;.</p><p>&gt;    As one of the group of 1/3-tone equal temperaments with<br/>&gt; highly recognizable perfect fifths, 17 sounds quite similar<br/>&gt; to 19. These tunings both share the same general overall<br/>&gt; &quot;sound,&quot; and experience shows that a composition in 17 can<br/>&gt; often be turned into a composition in 19 with little<br/>&gt; difference in its overall &quot;sound&quot; (the same goes for a<br/>&gt; composition in 19 turned into one in 17).  Melodically, 17<br/>&gt; and 19 sound nearly identical.  Harmonically, they differ<br/>&gt; greatly insofar as 19 offers a smooth major triad while 17<br/>&gt; does not -- but in that case substituting a 17 equal neutral<br/>&gt; triad often produces much the same musical effect as the 19<br/>&gt; equal major triad.</p><p>So, if I&apos;m reading this right, for someone writing tonalish<br/>music, the mapping from 3323332 to 3223232 seems to preserve<br/>more musical intent than mapping from 3323332 to 3313331?</p><p>It would be interesting if Hstick ever does this sort of<br/>mapping since he composes both on 19 and 34 tone guitars and<br/>could move compositions back and forth...when I have my 31<br/>tone guitar I&apos;ll have a similar capability in going from<br/>5535553 to 5445454...</p><p>Not to imply that tonalish music is the only game in town,<br/>just that it is my jumping off point.</p><p>Lots of other points snipped including the midi studio<br/>hell thing. Yes, actually making the music IS much harder<br/>than all the &quot;pre-compositional&quot; work.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
