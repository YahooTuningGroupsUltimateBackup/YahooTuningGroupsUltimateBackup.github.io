But that<br/>&gt;scheme was tried by Felix Krueger in 1906 and was<br/>&gt;conclusively debunked by Carl Stumpf in 1908.</p><p>Where in that quote, Brian, are you getting difference<br/>tones?</p><p>&gt;     SUMMARY OF THE FAILURES OF DIFFERENCE TONE THEORIES<br/>/.../</p><p>Difference tones can be used musically, but I agree they are<br/>not likely to be the root of any major aspect of western<br/>music as we know it.</p><p>&gt;    Given the overwhelming eveidence against any musical<br/>&gt;important of difference tones for human hearing, it&apos;s<br/>&gt;clear that Boomsliter &amp; Creel&apos;s theory rests on a<br/>&gt;foundation which has already been demmolished.</p><p>Brian, Boomsliter and Creel&apos;s ideas have nothing to do with<br/>difference tones.  They may have speculated at some point<br/>that difference tones could provide a mechanism for<br/>projecting new roots at just intervals, but nothing in their<br/>main thesis depends on, or has anything to say about<br/>difference tones.</p><p>Most, if not all of the theories on difference tones I&apos;ve<br/>heard of are probably incorrect, I&apos;ll grant you.</p><p>&gt;     The second big problem with Boomsliter &amp; Creel&apos;s<br/>&gt;theory of extended reference is that it boils down to<br/>&gt;unsupported personal preference.</p><p>Absolutely correct.  Boomsliter and Creel didn&apos;t even have<br/>a theory.  They had a hypothesis.</p><p>&gt;      Well, you can see the whole plaethora of problems<br/>&gt;with Boomsliter &amp; Creel&apos;s test procedure.</p><p>Yep.</p><p>&gt;      First, since B&amp;C present while the listener used the<br/>&gt; search organ, they could have influenced hi/r without<br/>&gt; meaning to.</p><p>Yep.</p><p>&gt;       Second, the listener being tested always knew which<br/>&gt; pitches on the search organ he was playing, so there was<br/>&gt; a vast opportunity for bias, depending on the test<br/>&gt; subject&apos;s innate theoretical bias.</p><p>Yep, though unlikely that the subjects could have figured<br/>out in real time which sequences amounted to a chain of<br/>small ratios and which didn&apos;t.</p><p>&gt;        Third, the test subjects were ONLY given a choice<br/>&gt; of pitches already chosen on the search organ by<br/>&gt; Boomsliter &amp; Creel, which intolerably and unacceptably<br/>&gt; biases the entire experiment.</p><p>This strikes me as the first serious problem.</p><p>&gt;        Fifth, lots of experiments show that performers<br/>&gt; tend to compress musical intervals smaller than a<br/>&gt; minor third and expand musical intervals larger than a<br/>&gt; minor third. This is probably what the test subjects were<br/>&gt; doing, and they merely chose the nearest available JI<br/>&gt; pitches even though JI has nothing to do with what was<br/>&gt; going on.</p><p>Well, I don&apos;t know about that.  But you imply, and I agree,<br/>that B&amp;C never show their extended reference interpretations<br/>are unique... that such an interp. can&apos;t be created for any<br/>sequence of choices at the organ, or that a given sequence<br/>can&apos;t have more than one interp.  This is the biggest hole<br/>in Boomsliter and Creel, in my opinion.</p><p>&gt;        Sixth, B&amp;C did not provide an adequate set of<br/>&gt; alternatives for listeners. They should have provided<br/>&gt; 12 equal AND extended reference pitches AND a whole<br/>&gt; set of non-just non-equal-tempered pitches. But B&amp;C<br/>&gt; couldn&apos;t do that because their search organ was<br/>&gt; very limited in the total number of alternate pitches<br/>&gt; it could allow for each musical notes. To put it bluntly,<br/>&gt; the search organ was a piss poor idea from the outset<br/>&gt; because you can only have so many keys on any keyboard-<br/>&gt; based musical instrument.</p><p>Well, I think a suitably-constructed keyboard, with a<br/>suitably-large equal temperament and the right experiment,<br/>it could work.</p><p>In another approach, subjects could be recorded singing the<br/>melodies, and the recordings could then be subjected to<br/>pitch-tracking (a technology that didn&apos;t exist when the<br/>original study was done).</p><p>Lastly, a tool like melodyne could be used to create several<br/>versions of a melody, and blind comparative listening tests<br/>could be done.</p><p>&gt;   There is not one shred of evidence for the false claim<br/>&gt; that singers or string players &quot;naturally play in just<br/>&gt; intonation,&quot;</p><p>You never said what type of JI you meant -- melodic or<br/>harmonic -- and you cussed me out when I asked.  At the<br/>time, we were discussing adaptive tuning, which deals with<br/>harmonic intonation.  Now we&apos;re discussing B&amp;C, who deal<br/>with melodic intonation.  Which, or both, is it?</p><p>&gt; and there much evidence against the musical old wive&apos;s<br/>&gt; tale that solo performers &quot;naturally play in JI.&quot; --</p><p>There must be, since you&apos;ve already called it a &quot;false&quot;<br/>claim.</p><p>&gt;     Lastly, we may note that Boomsliter &amp; Creel&apos;s approach<br/>&gt; is a typical Western mathematical reductionist approach<br/>&gt; to music. First, the issue to be studied is stripped of<br/>&gt; its complexity by removing it from the real world (instead<br/>&gt; of playing free pitches, the performer is forced to choose<br/>&gt; from among the predigested pitches available on the search<br/>&gt; organ).  Then the issue to be studied is boiled down<br/>&gt; further to a mathematical skeleton (i.e., B&amp;C&apos;s extended<br/>&gt; reference scheme).  The final stage occurs when the<br/>&gt; researcher declares the original rich complexity of<br/>&gt; the real intonation in real music in the real world<br/>&gt; irrelevant, and substitutes the dessicated mathematical<br/>&gt; skeleton for the rich living original as the &quot;real&quot;<br/>&gt; version.</p><p>Yeah, you definitely have a point.  But you&apos;re wrong to<br/>assume &quot;people like me&quot; are up to the same thing, without<br/>taking the time to consider what we&apos;re saying.  Music theory<br/>has moved beyond it&apos;s embarrassing roots, right here on the<br/>internet.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
