I&apos;d personally love to hear what that sounds like.</p><p>Hi Jacky and Jeff,</p><p>I&apos;ve been thinking of something since the introduction of this<br/>&quot;frog&quot; thread (by me, I guess) which suddenly has become very<br/>relevant with Jacky&apos;s request here.</p><p>Frogs and some other animals create a sound mass deliberately,<br/>because it helps them to know when an intruder has entered their<br/>environment.  As long as the sound keeps reflecting back to them<br/>unchanged, they know they&apos;re alone.  But as soon as something,<br/>a human for example, enters their area, it changes the reflection<br/>of the sound and they know something is there, and they stop<br/>making the noise, in order to protect themselves.</p><p>Try it out!  Go towards the direction of the frog sound mass,<br/>and you can&apos;t help but notice that at some point as you get closer,<br/>there will suddenly be silence.</p><p>Someone told me about this (I&apos;m pretty sure it was Ken Fasano,<br/>when I visited him the day after I met you, Jacky, because in<br/>back of his house lived thousands of frogs that were doing this),<br/>and I haven&apos;t looked it up, so I don&apos;t have any other reference.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
