(I have all except the early ones).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could also get it to generate a list of the e-mail addresses of all those<br/>&gt; who posted, since the complete e-mail addresses are shown in the digests,<br/>&gt; and then we could mail to them all and ask if they are happy for their posts to<br/>&gt; be re-posted, which would also be a way of letting everyone know about the<br/>&gt; new group (as some of the members don&apos;t belong to the tuning list).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I haven&apos;t quite figured out how to program to send an e-mail with the<br/>&gt; original author of the post as the apparent originator of the<br/>&gt; e-mail, so the re-posted messages would all have to show up<br/>&gt; under my name as author, but would be shown as forwarded messages<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Like this:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; In messages listings:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Author: Robert Walker<br/>&gt; Subject: FW: Re: Wooden frets?! - David J.

If you go over that<br/>&gt; number, then Yahoo&apos;s detection system for auto-responding<br/>&gt; goes into effect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yahoo&apos;s problem here is the &quot;I am on vacation&quot; type message<br/>&gt; that some people set as an automatic response to an incoming<br/>&gt; e-mail. Suppose also they are on individual e-mail subscription.<br/>&gt; Their p.c. gets an e-mail from a Yahoo group, replies with the<br/>&gt; &quot;I am on vacation&quot; response, that gets relayed back to them<br/>&gt; as a post from the group, their p.c. replies to that saying<br/>&gt; &quot;I am on vacation&quot; again, ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; So, would upload at rate of one message every 30 seconds, say,<br/>&gt; then 450 messages would take getting on for four hours.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Maybe more - e.g. if my ISP disconnects (as it can) and I have<br/>&gt; to reconnect.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I could warn you about it in advance, and we could all switch to no<br/>&gt; e-mail mode, (or get Jeff to do it for us) while it happened.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, that seems an awkward solution.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A better idea, if we want to do this, might be to do it the other way round<br/>&gt; - I&apos;d ask Jeff to make another group, say, new_crazy_music<br/>&gt; then before anyone joins it, I&apos;d forward all the posts from PMG to it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When that was all done, I&apos;d let you know, and then Jeff can rename crazy_music<br/>&gt; to crazy_music_was, and then rename the new_crazy_music to crazy_music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then we all rejoin crazy_music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Then finally, I can repost all the messages from crazy_music_was to crazy_music,<br/>&gt; and there we are, all the posts from PMG in chronological order, followed by<br/>&gt; the ones from crazy_music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, no idea whether this the thing to do, it&apos;s something to discuss, but<br/>&gt; it may be of interest to know that it can be done if we do decide on it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:crazy_music-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">crazy_music-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
