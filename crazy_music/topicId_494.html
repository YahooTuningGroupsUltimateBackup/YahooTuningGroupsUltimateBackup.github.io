It&apos;s basically a &quot;pop&quot; piece as part of his musical,<br/>which was never produced (another reason to wallow...)</p><p>Zhurbin is *very* interested in microtonality and, in fact, is going<br/>to be playing my VIOLAHEXY in the future, so, given this fact, I<br/>thought I might be excused by including a link to this piece in 12-<br/>tET.</p><p>For the &quot;composing set&quot; on this list... note the &quot;long line.&quot;  Nadia<br/>Boulanger really was right about this.</p><p>Are you crying yet??  Good....   &quot;Enjoy&quot;</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/1639/1639544.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/1639/1639544.html</a></p><p>_________ ______ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
