I have some random CDs of music from Bali and percussion<br/>&gt; music from some &quot;Island people&quot;. I&apos;d love to have some recommendations<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; displaying the concepts you mentioned (quasi-ET not approximating JI,<br/>&gt; modulation, addition of &apos;semitones&apos; to create something more like<br/>&gt; constant structures).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On a similar note, I was listenning to some Thai music and trying to<br/>&gt; duplicate its tunings. It certainly did not seem like 7tet since the<br/>&gt; fifth<br/>&gt; was very good. I tried a neutral scale in 31<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4554445 (a non-MOS variation on 4545445)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; which seemed to &apos;crumple&apos; all the notes in the right places but I<br/>&gt; was unable to produce the vibe I was hearing. What are the cents<br/>&gt; values<br/>&gt; or names in the Scala archive of scales that may be close<br/>&gt; approximations?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bob Valentine<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                    Yahoo!
