(He&apos;ll correct me if I&apos;m wrong.) At<br/>least, the person posting as &quot;xenharmonic&quot; must know McLaren.</p><p>I don&apos;t usually post on this list. Someone mentioned a post here<br/>recently, so I dropped in to have a look at some of the posts.</p><p>Then, I did a brief search on <a href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> and via Google and I can&apos;t<br/>come up with any Brian McLaren CDs for sale. So where can a person buy<br/>Brian McLaren CDs? Does anyone here know? Where can I find a list of<br/>McLaren CDs for sale? How much do they cost?</p><p>As far as buying and listening... Xenharmonic urges us to buy<br/>microtonal CDs and listen. I buy a lot of CDs. Some of them are<br/>microtonal. But like all music, there&apos;s microtonal stuff that<br/>interests me and stuff that doesn&apos;t. So I don&apos;t buy music just<br/>*because* it&apos;s microtonal. But I buy quite a bit of the music that I like.</p><p>And I don&apos;t tend to buy music on CD without having ever heard a single<br/>example of the composer&apos;s work. Why should I? Most times in the past<br/>when I&apos;ve bought without having listened first, I end up with a CD<br/>that doesn&apos;t interest me. That&apos;s why it would be nice to be able to<br/>hear some examples of McLaren&apos;s work. So how does one find out about it?</p></div><h3><a id=1277 href="#1277">ðŸ”—</a>Gene Ward Smith &#x3C;gwsmith@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/29/2004 9:55:35 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:crazy_music@yahoogroups.com">crazy_music@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Rick McGowan&quot; &lt;rick@u...&gt; wrote:</p><p>&gt; And I don&apos;t tend to buy music on CD without having ever heard a<br/>single<br/>&gt; example of the composer&apos;s work.
