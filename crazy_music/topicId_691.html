Put on those dancing shoes and check it out!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It sounds like the patches could be improved, but the 7-limit<br/>&gt; retuning&apos;s working without a glitch.</p><p>Thanks, Graham!  Glad you like it.  If you or anyone else<br/>can and wants to play my GM file using better sounds, feel<br/>free.  I&apos;ll upload the MIDI to the files section too.</p><p>This little ditty has a special place in my heart.  I just<br/>wrote to John deLaubenfels about it this morning, and I<br/>suppose what I wrote him is worth quoting here, at the very<br/>least to acknowledge his contribution to what you&apos;re hearing:</p><p>&gt; I thought-up this piece while working in the kitchen of a<br/>&gt; convalescent home in Los Angeles back in the summer of 1981<br/>&gt; (my first abortive attempt to live in California), and<br/>&gt; wrote a sketch of it (just melody and chord-letters) down<br/>&gt; on manuscript paper.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But in the two decades since then, I never recorded,<br/>&gt; sequenced, or even *played* it once!  Except for that sketchy<br/>&gt; lead-sheet (which we both know well is *not* a very accurate<br/>&gt; representation of the piece), the only place it ever really<br/>&gt; existed all that time was in my head!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It was only just a couple of months ago that I finally<br/>&gt; decided to draw the notes into my computer screen and create<br/>&gt; the MIDI-file.  And the 12-EDO version did *not* sound like<br/>&gt; the one in my head!  Your 7-limit adaptive JI version does!<br/>&gt; So you definitely deserve a pat on the back for a job well done!</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
