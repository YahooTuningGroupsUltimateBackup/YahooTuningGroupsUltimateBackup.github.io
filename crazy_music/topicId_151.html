The Sethares dissonance curve was calculated<br/>using the formulas in Appendix E of _Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum,<br/>Scale_, specifically the Matlab code, with a starting note of<br/>Partch&apos;s G 392 and seven partials with amplitude 1, which is what<br/>Sethares shows in the Matlab code example.</p><p>If anyone has Derive 5 and wants the code, just let me know. IIRC<br/>Derive costs $250 for &quot;industrial users&quot; like me and under $100 for<br/>academic folk. That&apos;s much less than Mathematica or Matlab, but more<br/>expensive than the free Matlab clones like SciLab and Octave. I paid<br/>my money and took my choice :-).</p><p>Derive can output code in C, Basic or Pascal (sadly, not Perl :-) so<br/>it won&apos;t be too difficult for me to translate this into a programming<br/>language. I have the full Adobe Acrobat, so I can create a PDF<br/>document with the code if anyone wants to look at it. Meanwhile, I<br/>uploaded a JPEG of the curve and points. My apologies to anyone who<br/>was expecting me to use the Harmonic Entropy formulation ... I<br/>haven&apos;t had a chance to decode that yet from Matlab and encode it<br/>into Derive.</p><p>I&apos;m going to try and build a contour plot later tonight or tomorrow<br/>of all the triads.<br/>--<br/>M.
