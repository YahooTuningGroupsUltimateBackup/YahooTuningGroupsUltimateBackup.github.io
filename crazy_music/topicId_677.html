Some listeners,<br/>&gt; like Jeff Scott describe the result as &quot;brutal<br/>&gt; abortions,&quot; while other listeners (like myself)<br/>&gt; simply consider them &quot;out of tune.&quot;</p><p>Arg! Please be more careful  when quoting me!</p><p>Here is what I said (in part):</p><p>&gt;&gt; I accept that John actually likes those consonant low-limit<br/>&gt;&gt; chords. And I believe that he hears things the way he does.<br/>&gt;&gt; And that is fine. EVERYBODY has programmed their neural<br/>&gt;&gt; networks differently and projective value judgements are<br/>&gt;&gt; impossible. We can only describe what we ourselves hear and<br/>&gt;&gt; have no ability to hear what other people do.</p><p>&gt;&gt; I listen to all the examples he puts up of well known music<br/>&gt;&gt; he&apos;s retuned and it drives me nuts! I hate it! It sounds<br/>&gt;&gt; horrible to me! I can hardly bear to listen to it!</p><p>&gt;&gt; I remain quiet though since I see there is potential.</p><p>&gt;&gt; But I know that his whole system is under development and so<br/>&gt;&gt; I trudge on, obediently listening to each new example,<br/>&gt;&gt; hoping that *someday* I won&apos;t be irritable and annoyed after<br/>&gt;&gt; listening to these brutal abominations!!<br/>                      -------------------</p><p>&gt;&gt; Today is that day!</p><p>Note also that I didn&apos;t say anyone (&amp; everyone) hears<br/>it this way -- I only speak for myself.</p><p>In case anyone wonders what the difference is:</p><p>  art as abortion -- a creative act never made it to<br/>    birth because the art was malformed or its creator<br/>    was not healthy enough to bring it forth</p><p>  art as abomination -- a creative act has been brought<br/>    forth but it is a malformed monstrosity, shocking<br/>    to the sensibilities of ordinary people!</p><p>:-P</p><p>- Jeff</p><p>--<br/>&quot;What&apos;s more complex?
