And the interest in natural<br/>sounds, as sparked by Jeff Scott Jacky Ligon reminded me of a quote I<br/>saw recently from one of our lifetime&apos;s truly singular and great<br/>people, Pauline Oliveros. As part of a background piece on her for a<br/>recent Los Angeles concert, there was this:</p><p>&quot;Pauline Oliveros is the originator of the concept of &quot;deep<br/>listening,&quot; a practice combining improvisation with meditation and<br/>the incorporation of environmental sounds into the space of<br/>performance. About the genesis of her practice she has<br/>written, &quot;Shortly after receiving the gift of my tape recorder in<br/>1953 I placed the microphone in the window of my San Francisco<br/>apartment and recorded the sound environment....although I thought<br/>that I was listening while recording I was surprised to find sounds<br/>on the tape that I had not heard consciously. With this discovery I<br/>gave myself a meditation: &quot;Listen to everything all the time and<br/>remind yourself when you are not listening&quot;.</p><p>Yes indeed.</p><p>Listening,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=1013 href="#1013">ðŸ”—</a>Seth Austen &#x3C;klezmusic@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/9/2001 6:20:55 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: &quot;Jon Szanto&quot; &lt;JSZANTO@...&gt;</p><p>&gt; &quot;Listen to everything all the time and<br/>&gt; remind yourself when you are not listening&quot;.</p><p>Thanks for posting this, it&apos;s a wonderful reminder of what makes her own<br/>music so special.</p><p>Seth<br/>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: seth@...<br/>klezmusic@...</p></div>
