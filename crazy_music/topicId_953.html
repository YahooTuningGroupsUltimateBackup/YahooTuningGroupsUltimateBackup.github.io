At one concert I asked him some questions<br/>and he said that the stress of the whole scene kills<br/>the cactus after a few performances and so he has to<br/>keep getting new cactuses. He also had some theories<br/>about the high water content of the cactus interior<br/>contributing greatly to the sound and such. I don&apos;t<br/>remember. The concerts were over 10 years ago I think.</p><p>Anyway, the article posted is cool since the guy<br/>records them out in the natural environment and lets<br/>the rain naturally pluck the cactus instead of plucking<br/>them himself until it keels over dead. Very respectful;<br/>very nice.</p><p>Anyway one thing I wanted to say about the frog file<br/>I posted is that our natural environment creates far<br/>better, more complex, and more interesting microtonal<br/>music than we do.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=956 href="#956">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>8/7/2001 2:23:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;X.

I too, am continually quite inspired by the orchestra<br/>of peepers in the swampy field next door. A friend of mine came up to our<br/>house one evening and after hearing the particularly spectacular performance<br/>they gave as we were standing outside listening as the almost full moon<br/>rose, was inspired to record them. He came up the next three nights at the<br/>same time, minidisk recorder in hand, not a sound... I think he finally got<br/>a decent recording in another location, if so, I&apos;ll copy it sometime and<br/>post an excerpt.</p><p>Seth</p><p>--<br/>Seth Austen</p><p><a href="http://www.sethausten.com">http://www.sethausten.com</a><br/>emails: seth@...<br/>klezmusic@...</p></div>
