The Script separates every c/c#/d/d# [...] and so on to 12 different tracks/channels, then inserts a pitchbend command before each note. I know of Joe Monzos micro-Cal, but as far as I could understand it, it is for step-Edit, and not for treating existing Midi-Recordings? I also found Scripts to divide a track into many [the Cakewalk one: not summarizing all notes of same octave into ONE track&quot;], and a random Pitch Cal, that I can use to place random Pitchbends before any note. What I practically want to have is a &quot;tuned&quot; combination of these, that would really help to save time and fastly change possibilities. I really hope I don&apos;t have to start learning the programming language ;)<br/>Maybe anybody of you (the idea does not sound as if it never has been used before, does it?) has some Cal like this, or one of the same idea-family ... thanks a lot!</p><p>All best sound wishes<br/>Clemens</p><p>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</p></div><h3><a id=1243 href="#1243">ðŸ”—</a>X.
