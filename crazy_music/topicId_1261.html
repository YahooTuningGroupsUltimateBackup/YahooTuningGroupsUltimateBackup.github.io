Why, you don&apos;t ask?  To tell you the truth, it&apos;s 4:30<br/>a.m. and I&apos;m procrastinating.  Being an inescapably human being who absolutely must<br/>get a grip on and categorize everything and everyone as best as possible, I am still<br/>trying to get a decent grip on this McLaren guy.  Why him in particular?  His writings<br/>are amusing and I find myself agreeing with many of them.  He makes some sense.</p><p>In the 800 or so messages I had to skim to get to one of his crazymusic posts that<br/>wasn&apos;t deleted (so did that turn out to be Yahoo&apos;s doing or what?) I had a lot of other<br/>reactions of course.  As usual, I lament being an oblivious high-schooler during this<br/>time, which apparently was rich in exchange of ideas and diverse in the contributing<br/>individuals. Perhaps it&apos;s better now that everyone&apos;s seemingly gone away to live real<br/>lives.  I also realized that a lot of questions that I think about frequently -- those of<br/>instrument design, technology, notation -- have a long history &apos;round these parts.  So<br/>I wonder, is it better to try and extract all from 3-years-ago threads by jumping one<br/>by one through yahoo pages? Or would it behoove me to bring up the same<br/>questions, those which seemingly lie at the root of pRaCtIcAl MiCrOtOnAlItY itself?  Or<br/>maybe there are non-online resources which people could point me toward.</p><p>Most importantly to me, I wonder how I shall be able to contribute.  For years I have<br/>thought, yeah!, when I grow up I want to build instruments.  I have held myself to be<br/>capable in both musical and technical matters (my attention span in both is ever an<br/>issue), still at the point where my education could go in any direction, and I have<br/>generally thought that I can do well with any direction that I go in.  So what direction<br/>would people benefit most from?  A synthesizer with banks of scales, banks of<br/>timbres, on top of banks of bent partials? A family of BP clarinets? Slide crummhorns?</p><p>Jacob</p></div><h3>X. J.

Only when these<br/>aspects are healthy should much talking even be bothered with. Thus, to the<br/>extent that there are no messages and no posting on any of the tuning<br/>groups, the tuning groups have succeeded if their goal is to encourage the<br/>writing and exploration of music in xenharmonic and other tuning systems.</p><p>&gt;  I also realized that a lot of questions that I think about frequently<br/>&gt; -- those of instrument design, technology, notation -- have a long history<br/>&gt; &apos;round these parts.  So I wonder, is it better to try and extract all from<br/>&gt; 3-years-ago threads by jumping one by one through yahoo pages?</p><p>99% of the stuff probably doesn&apos;t matter. I&apos;d recommend Andrew&apos;s fine<br/>listening list to find out what&apos;s going on in a broad sense and then just<br/>jump right in.</p><p>As far as instrument building goes, there are at least a couple dozen books<br/>out on musical instrument building and design! Never before have there been<br/>so many possibilities. Just get started and see what happens. If stuck,<br/>email or letters to instrument builders can help, or just further<br/>experiments and inventions. For ready made instruments, there are many<br/>places where finely crafted Turkish, Egyptian, Indian, Indonesian and other<br/>instruments can be acquired, ofter for obscenely low prices, completely<br/>ready to go microtonally.</p><p>&gt; Or would it<br/>&gt; behoove me to bring up the same questions, those which seemingly lie at the<br/>&gt; root of pRaCtIcAl MiCrOtOnAlItY itself?  Or maybe there are non-online<br/>&gt; resources which people could point me toward.</p><p>So many books out there. Everything by Bart Hopkins and everything by Dennis<br/>Waring to begin with. That should keep an instrument builder occupied for at<br/>least a decade.</p><p>&gt; Most importantly to me, I wonder how I shall be able to contribute.

If designing and building microtonal wind and brass instruments<br/>is your passion, then go for it and don&apos;t look back!</p><p>I will say that in my opinion there is certainly a vast oversupply of<br/>theory, so further contributions in that area are probably not necessary.</p><p>&gt; A synthesizer with banks of scales, banks of timbres, on top of banks of bent<br/>&gt; partials? A family of BP clarinets? Slide crummhorns?</p><p>Nonoctave clarinets? Sure! Slide crumhorns? Haven&apos;t seen one of those<br/>before! Lead the way wtih music...</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
