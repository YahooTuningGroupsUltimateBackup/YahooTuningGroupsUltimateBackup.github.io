Scott &#x3C;xjscott@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2002 7:45:32 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Friends,</p><p>Let me bounce some ideas off you all here.</p><p>I am trying to come up with good english terms and<br/>symbols for a useful math operator I want to introduce<br/>to the tuning language. It&apos;s something many of us have<br/>worked with but I am not aware of a good general term<br/>for it.</p><p>IDEA #1: REMAINDERING FOR NON-INTEGERS</p><p>As you know, there is regular real number division:</p><p>7 / 2 = 3.5</p><p>and there is integer division:</p><p>7 / 2 = 3 remainder 1</p><p>which can also be expressed using the div and mod<br/>&apos;operators&apos;:</p><p>7 div 2 = 3<br/>7 mod 2 = 1</p><p>(div is the integer division operation and mod is<br/>integer remainder operation).</p><p>Another way to show how remainder works is as<br/>follows:</p><p>7 mod 2 = 7 - ((7 div 2) * 2) = 7 - (3 * 2) = 7-6 = 1</p><p>But why should there not also be remainders from<br/>fractional and real numbers using the same mechanism:</p><p>4.5 div 3 = 1<br/>4.5 mod 3 = 1.5</p><p>...since this idea of having something &apos;leftover&apos;<br/>or remaindered is generally useful.</p><p>IDEA #2: TUNING INTERVALS AND POWER OPERATIONS</p><p>OK, next - lets look at the frequently discussed tuning<br/>operation of deriving the syntonic comma - the place<br/>where the just octave 2/1 and the just 3/2 fifth don&apos;t<br/>line up -- the difference between 12 fifths and 7<br/>octaves is a small interval - the syntonic comma.</p><p>The ratio of 12 fifths is (3/2) ^ 12, where the caret<br/>is the symbol or operator we use to indicate &apos;raised to<br/>the power of&apos;. Some people also use the symbol &apos;**&apos;,<br/>kind of showing that exponentiation (raising to a<br/>power) is a kind of hyper-multiplication: (3/2) ** 12</p><p>Likewise, the ratio of 7 octaves is 2/1 multiplied by<br/>itself 7 times, or (2/1)^7, or (2/1) ** 7.</p><p>To get the difference between two ratios, you divide<br/>them, so the difference here is:</p><p>(3/2) ^ 12<br/>---------- = syntonic comma<br/>(2/1) ^ 7</p><p>...which it turns out is about 23.46 cents.</p><p>Now the thing is that the operation on the fractions<br/>is rather unwieldy and inconvenient, and yet it is<br/>something we do often, especially if we are working<br/>with meantone or MOS scales.</p><p>It would be GREAT to have an operator so we could write<br/>this stuff a little more concisely. Sometimes I call<br/>this idea of letting one interval chain up and then be<br/>cut by another &apos;folding&apos;. But technically, it isn&apos;t<br/>really folding as much as it is shuffling, do you know<br/>what I mean? Anyway, I would like to be able to write:</p><p>(fifth ^ 12) fold_into octave</p><p>and have it come out with &apos;syntonic comma&apos;.<br/>(What is &apos;it&apos;? &apos;It&apos; is my interval calculator<br/>application.)</p><p>Now already, I have &apos;fifth&apos; predefined as 3/2 and<br/>octave defined as 2/1, so what I wrote above is really:</p><p>((3/2) ^ 12) fold_into (2/1) =&gt; syntonic comma</p><p>And we are left with wondering how this &apos;fold_into&apos;<br/>operator works. Well, it works like remainder actually.</p><p>Consider it in cents, where it really IS remainder:</p><p>ratio_to_cents(3/2) = 701.955 cents<br/>ratio_to_cents(2/1) = 1200.000 cents</p><p>ratio_to_cents((3/2)^12) = 12 * 701.955 cents =<br/>8423.460 cents.</p><p>8423.460 cents mod 1200.000 cents = 23.46 cents</p><p>Now you see why I started in about remainders of<br/>nonintegers -- it&apos;s a useful thing to be able to talk<br/>about in the tuning world.</p><p>The syntonic comma is the REMAINDER of DIVIDING an<br/>OCTAVE into twelve fifths. Obviously an octave &apos;divides<br/>into&apos; twelve fifths seven times, but not evenly, there<br/>is a remainder left over -- and that remainder is the<br/>syntonic comma.</p><p>In other words, comma is wery much like a remainder,<br/>and when working in cents (the log of frequency<br/>ratios), it is exactly like remainder.</p><p>But what do we call it when working in &apos;ratio space&apos;?<br/>What is this operator called? Well, it is basically a<br/>&apos;exponential remainder&apos; (frequency ratio is the<br/>exponent of cents just as cents is the logarithm of<br/>frequency ratio).</p><p>So we have the &apos;linear remainder&apos; - mod, and the<br/>&apos;exponential remainder&apos;.</p><p>Here is my question -- what terms do we use for talking<br/>about and what symbols do we like for writing this<br/>operation when working in the frequency ratio domain?</p><p>Here are some ideas:</p><p>syntonic comma = (fifth ^ 12) fold into octave<br/>syntonic comma = (fifth ^ 12) fold octave<br/>syntonic comma = (fifth ^ 12) shuffle into octave<br/>syntonic comma = (fifth ^ 12) shuffle octave<br/>syntonic comma = (fifth ^ 12) comma octave<br/>syntonic comma = (fifth ^ 12) , octave</p><p>syntonic comma = (fifth ^ 12) emod octave<br/>syntonic comma = (fifth ^ 12) emainder octave<br/>syntonic comma = (fifth ^ 12) %% octave</p><p>I kind of like the %% since in C, the linear mod<br/>operator is written &apos;%&apos; -- and exponential mod is to<br/>linear mod as power (**) is to multiplication (*).</p><p>Of course, there should also be an exponential div<br/>operator: I favor the following:</p><p>(fifth ^ 12) // octave = 7<br/>(fifth ^ 12) ediv octave = 7</p><p>Here of course, the &apos;//&apos; is a sort of hyperdiv<br/>operator.</p><p>Of course, that equation can be rearranged usefully to<br/>say things like: &quot;7 is the floor of the logarithm base<br/>octave of fifth&quot;. But how do we read it as above? I&apos;d<br/>like to say &quot;Twelve fifths exponentially divided by an<br/>octave gives 7 with a remainder of a syntonic comma&quot;.<br/>Isn&apos;t that better? I really think this is a better way<br/>of saying it, more precise and clear! The only issue is<br/>what to call the operation. What does everyone think?<br/>Any suggestions? Does this seem a good thing?</p><p>Other language issues:</p><p>What if we call these &apos;arithmetic remainder&apos; and<br/>&apos;geometrical remainder&apos; -- would that make sense? Or is<br/>&apos;linear remainder&apos; and &apos;exponential remainder&apos; better?</p><p>Feedback please!!</p><p>These are math operations we learn about in junior high<br/>here (logarithms &amp; exponents) and elementary school<br/>(remainder and dividend), but I harldy ever talk about<br/>it or write to people about it and on the tuning lists<br/>and books we have to resort to english language<br/>gymnastics &apos;the syntonic comma is the difference<br/>between seven octaves and 12 fifths&apos; - which is<br/>miseading since &apos;difference&apos; and &apos;seven&apos; and &apos;fifth&apos; do<br/>not mean the same thing here they would to most people<br/>in the world.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=1170 href="#1170">ðŸ”—</a>Orphon Soul, Inc. &#x3C;tuning@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/12/2002 9:06:57 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On 3/12/02 10:45 PM, &quot;X.

Here&apos;s the summary of my<br/>various issues:</p><p>1) Base-12 ? YES I LOVE BASE 12. Way better than silly<br/>decimal. I have my own system of counting in base-12<br/>and have memorized much of the base-12 multiplication<br/>tables.

I think it&apos;s very<br/>silly to thing that using a base made up out of prime<br/>numbers is useful for doing what amounts to arithmetic<br/>(tuning stuff). But I do agree with Nash that base<br/>prime is cool for mystical and ritualistic stuff.</p><p>3) Exponential remainders: I use these all the time and<br/>its time to come up with a word for it -- I guess I<br/>have -- but also a symbol for it because I&apos;ve decided<br/>to add an operator for it to my tuning software and<br/>want to know what people think makes sense.</p><p>I really like %% and //, and also ediv, emod, and<br/>emainder -- maybe I&apos;ll just add all of them?</p><p>Any comments on the operators?<br/>On the names?</p><p>I will have to alter the current lexing of &apos;//&apos; -- it<br/>is currently accepted as a line comment, like in C and<br/>C++.
