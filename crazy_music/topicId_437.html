Went from 2-D to multi-D.</p><p>Wow! I&apos;d love to hear these! Now that I have heard<br/>Chris&apos; cool example of how this adaptive retuning stuff<br/>can be done to -my- satisfaction :), I&apos;d like to hear<br/>more!</p><p>If they are posted, I promise that I will give you and<br/>John a full Psycho Evaluation.  :-) &lt;= attention!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=450 href="#450">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>7/15/2001 11:33:36 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>John truly I would like to use your adaptive tuning as a midi plugin<br/>to play with negative matrix values and &quot;springiness&quot; on fresh<br/>tunes.  I think there is a psychoacoustic effect of the constant<br/>retuning that can keep the ear from fatiguing and somehow increases<br/>the sense of spaciousness.  A wild theory is that it might be<br/>annoying when listening to known tunes because it forces the brain to<br/>readjust something it thought it knew.  Anyway the whole idea seems<br/>to have a lot of commercial potential as a creative plugin as well as<br/>an &quot;accurate&quot; retuner.</p><p>Mary</p></div><h3><a id=523 href="#523">ðŸ”—</a>David J.

I think there is a psychoacoustic effect of the constant<br/>&gt; retuning that can keep the ear from fatiguing and somehow increases<br/>&gt; the sense of spaciousness.</p><p>I agree.  It also colors the mood in various, sometimes surprising<br/>ways.  I tend to feel the differences in mood more so than hear the<br/>differences in tuning.</p><p>I think that&apos;s part of what a capella groups and string groups tend to<br/>do intuitively.  My hope was that John&apos;s algorithm might head off in<br/>that direction but instead it seems to do something similar but<br/>different.  Which can be a very good thing, a fresh sounding thing, as<br/>seen with his retuning of Chris Bailey&apos;s wonderful sonata.</p><p>His program may end up helping to demonstrate by negative example that<br/>humans singing or playing flexible pitch instruments do *not*<br/>typically tend toward JI.  Exceptions, of course, would be in styles<br/>that grew out of Celtic roots, such as Bluegrass and Southern Gospel.<br/> But typically, I would guess that musicians in flexible pitch<br/>environments intuitively intone not always so much to gain consonance<br/>as to achieve or enhance the appropriate mood; or perhaps some<br/>compromise between the two in some cases.  All guess work based on<br/>listening, I admit; no hard data.</p><p>&gt;  A wild theory is that it might be<br/>&gt; annoying when listening to known tunes because it forces the brain<br/>to<br/>&gt; readjust something it thought it knew.</p><p>Agree with that, too.  In general, the better I know a piano piece,<br/>the more it bothers me to hear it adaptively retuned.  Also, within<br/>the confines of the Common Practice Era, the later in time the piece<br/>comes from, the more it bothers me to hear it retuned.  I like his<br/>retuning of ensembles better than of piano, probably at least partly<br/>because I expect a piano to have a stable tuning.  Chris&apos; piece is the<br/>&quot;exception that proves the rule.&quot;</p><p>Talk about crazy music: the piano that wouldn&apos;t sit still.  :-)</p><p>David</p></div>
