A quiet, darkened room, headphones<br/>if possible, alone if possible.  I closed my eyes and soon felt half<br/>asleep yet wide awake at the same time.</p><p>The music is not pleasant; it is not sweet; it has no tonic (that I<br/>could discern); it has no time signature.  What happens is quite<br/>unpredictable, almost chaotic on first hearing.</p><p>I had the sensation of being in a dream as a very young child (2 or 3<br/>years old), in which the world is a very uncertain place, with dangerous<br/>forces all around.  A war zone, yet also an all-enveloping womb.  At<br/>times it seemed like an underwater hell, complete with the wails of the<br/>damned.  But one moves through hell, never staying in one room very<br/>long, howbeit there are many rooms with many kinds of torment.</p><p>At any given moment, there is likely to be a wide range of frequencies<br/>sounding together, from very low bass to moderately high treble, with<br/>variations of course, and the sensation is usually neither consonant nor<br/>dissonant.</p><p>Gradually, through succeeding tracks, I felt I was emerging from water<br/>and ascending into ethereal realms.  I didn&apos;t make it all the way<br/>through in one sitting (there are 19 tracks and about 63 minutes of<br/>music), but did get past track 12, which I have been charged with<br/>focusing on for unblocking purposes.</p><p>Mary had predicted that I&apos;d have interesting dreams, and I did.  I was<br/>diving into the ocean, sorting out tracts of water, deciding which to<br/>keep and which to discard.  Some that I wanted to keep were<br/>uncomfortably loud, but I realized that it was possible to turn their<br/>volume down to a level I could live with.</p><p>As for the liner notes... they refer to things I know little of and am<br/>not in a position to evaluate.  There is some mention of the microtonal<br/>tuning philosophy: a &quot;subharmonic of the Lambdoma Matrix of Pythagoras&quot;.<br/>Hmmm: must learn more!  But what I seek most in any music does not<br/>depend upon knowledge of how it was constructed.  Music is a portal into<br/>ourselves in some deep, mysterious way.  Mary&apos;s music reflects a<br/>powerful resonance with the way energy (of some kind) can be conveyed<br/>through that portal.  I recommend it highly!</p><p>JdL</p><p>P.S. Mary tells me she&apos;s almost out of this CD, but has a new one in the<br/>works.  Go, Mary!!</p></div>
