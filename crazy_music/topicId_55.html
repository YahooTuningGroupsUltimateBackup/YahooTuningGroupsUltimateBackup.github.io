I didn&apos;t have enough leeway to use any tuning<br/>VERY exotic, so I tried the early sketches in a couple different 1/4 comma<br/>meantones, and 12tET, and my 12-of-17 setup.  I liked the strident<br/>&quot;shimmering&quot; 3rds and 5ths of 17tET for this.  It sounded quite a bit<br/>darker in meantone, with those stable 3rds and flat fifths.</p><p>Orphon Soul wrote...</p><p>&gt; First it sounded like the music to a marital arts movie.<br/>&gt; Then it sounded a little like music to an old cowboy movie...</p><p>Heh heh...  Yes.  The play has sort of 3 kinds of people: fairies of<br/>course, and some nobility, and some working class folks (&quot;mechanicals&quot;).<br/>This leads naturally to 3 big sections of the overture, and 3 themes for<br/>different scenes of the play.  The overture themes are ordered Fairies,<br/>then Mechanicals, then the Court, leading into the first scene.  I wanted a<br/>sort of &quot;squeegie&quot; cow-poke quality to the Mechanicals music.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
