(Post lists of large prime numbers here<br/>&gt; &gt; and you&apos;ll have your head handed you on a platter).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Dear Robert,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It would be highly unlikely that I would post scales here without a<br/>&gt; musical demonstration of the scales. In fact those days of posting<br/>&gt; scales without music are over for me. Even though I have did a bit of<br/>&gt; this, I *always* write some music or improvise with any scales I<br/>&gt; design. I wouldn&apos;t wish to waste folks time with something that I<br/>&gt; hadn&apos;t confirmed with my own ears.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Not everyone tries every scale that is posted. I&apos;ve tried Dan<br/>&gt; &gt; Stearns, since he seemed to be pursuing a similar thread to one<br/>&gt; &gt; I&apos;d been chasing. I tried 34 and 29, somehow bumping into them<br/>&gt; &gt; via some of Margos posts. I recently was swimming around in<br/>&gt; &gt; 7 and 14 tet after a post on this list managed to reach out of<br/>&gt; &gt; the screen and shake a fist in my face.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes - Dan and Margo are two gentlefolk who I have learned greatly<br/>&gt; from. Two shining stars and dear friends (like you) from the ATL to<br/>&gt; be sure.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even though I am greatly honored when someone try&apos;s out a scale I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; designed - or better yet - writes music with them, it is totally<br/>&gt; irrelevant to me if everyone is interested. The reason being is as<br/>&gt; follows: Everything I do with scale design is directly and<br/>&gt; inseparably wedded to the act of musical creation, and reflects my<br/>&gt; own personal style, tastes and judgments. So all that anyone has seen<br/>&gt; from me in this regard is very personal and made for the style of my<br/>&gt; music. This stuff may look completely wacked to most folks, and I&apos;ve<br/>&gt; been told before that as far as JI goes, my goals with scales are not<br/>&gt; to be considered &quot;mainstream&quot;. I would never argue this important<br/>&gt; point. The reason why my scales *look* wacked is because I design<br/>&gt; scales to have special melodic attributes. Think about it - melodic<br/>&gt; scale design is mostly an untapped thing as far as what most folks<br/>&gt; are into, yet for 15 years prior to coming to these wacky internet<br/>&gt; tuning forums, this has been one of my predominant focuses. All you<br/>&gt; lattice guys had me scratchin&apos; my bald head in confusion, until I<br/>&gt; understood what the differences were between what you where trying to<br/>&gt; do, and what I was using in my music. The difference is *melody*<br/>&gt; baby. I don&apos;t give a hoot (usually) about all the 5 limit harmonies I<br/>&gt; can shoehorn into a scale. My ears yearned for more complex scales<br/>&gt; years ago. Now don&apos;t get me wrong - I love&apos;s me some sweet sounding<br/>&gt; JI on occasion, but can&apos;t rest at those lower limit levels. I like<br/>&gt; that *shimmery* thing in my scales. In other words, I like Feral<br/>&gt; Scales - wild, unruly - untamed - unchained &quot;Primitive Man Scales&quot;,<br/>&gt; that nobody gives a care about. I&apos;m a Xenharmonic Atavism, with a<br/>&gt; furrowed Cro-Magnon brow, wooden club and massive body hair, setting<br/>&gt; around a campfire 30,000-50,000 years ago (nobody wake me up this is<br/>&gt; fun!).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What is more important to me than anything as far as scale design<br/>&gt; goes, is to create structures which have a very distinct and unique<br/>&gt; sound pattern. And as hard-headed as it might sound, to do this from<br/>&gt; my own mind. Perhaps some of this *appears* to be in error, when one<br/>&gt; comes at tuning from a purely theoretical standpoint where everything<br/>&gt; must set pretty on the lattice, but me - I smash the lattice and get<br/>&gt; on with what sounds good to me for a given musical context.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; When some theorist tells me &quot;Your scales *would* sound out of tune, I<br/>&gt; laugh because I know that they haven&apos;t yet tapped the treasures of<br/>&gt; melodic scale design. I ain&apos;t thinking about 5 limit harmonies - I<br/>&gt; ain&apos;t thinking about 7 limit harmonies and consonant maximization,<br/>&gt; which to me sounds bland as a cardboard box when applied to melodic<br/>&gt; music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Try it - you&apos;ll like it. Make a scale with an interesting melodic<br/>&gt; structure, build a fire and roast up a Mastodon an play your little<br/>&gt; booty off. Man - you modern cats don&apos;t know what you are missing.<br/>&gt; Throw those 5 limit harmonies on the fire to keep warm during the<br/>&gt; ritual - you don&apos;t need&apos;em.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You can&apos;t take lack of response personally (any more than you<br/>&gt; &gt; should take an over-enthusiastic-whether-positive-or-negative<br/>&gt; &gt; response).<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I don&apos;t take it personally - I just despise them for life. No -<br/>&gt; really I jest. I don&apos;t take it personally at all, and mostly I just<br/>&gt; don&apos;t care. The last two years of tuning insults have toughened me up<br/>&gt; a bit, but what comforts me in the winters of discontent, is my ever<br/>&gt; present music making practice, which has taught me more and given me<br/>&gt; more empirical knowledge than the combined efforts of 10,000 tuning<br/>&gt; lists. I assure you that if Joe Monzo hadn&apos;t came to visit me, and<br/>&gt; got me to come to the internet tuning forums, I&apos;d still be setting<br/>&gt; around a campfire somewhere making my primitive microtonal music, and<br/>&gt; would never have known or missed any of this wacky drama. Still it<br/>&gt; takes a back seat to making music for me and always will. I have 28+<br/>&gt; pieces of new microtonal music in the works, which will span 3-4 new<br/>&gt; CDs - so scales I don&apos;t need. Already got that, now I face the myriad<br/>&gt; of other equally important things that must come into play to<br/>&gt; complete the creative cycle. Microtonal scale design is but a very<br/>&gt; small facet of it all. I must design scales, design timbres, play<br/>&gt; instruments, write parts, sing, coach singers, use myriad software<br/>&gt; and plugins, create the artwork and text for the CDs, etc - all by<br/>&gt; myself. Hey - move to the wilderness with me - I could use an extra<br/>&gt; hand. Can you build a good fire? Can you palette Mastodon?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Grawghh,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky Ligon<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:crazy_music-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">crazy_music-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
