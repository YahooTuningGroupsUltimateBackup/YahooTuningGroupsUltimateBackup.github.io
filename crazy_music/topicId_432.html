But yahoo does keep track<br/>internally of how you voted and so you can always go<br/>back and change your vote if you change your mind.</p><p>- J</p><p>* in the sense it is objective and repeatible --<br/>sociometric polls are not the same as formulating a<br/>hypothesis (whether from observation, insight, or<br/>revelation) and proving or disproving it by<br/>constructing a repeatible, relevant experiment which<br/>includes observation and measurement. I consider the<br/>latter to be &apos;hard science&apos; &amp; the basis of the &apos;real&apos;<br/>scientific method. But soft science like polls can be<br/>interesting and helpful in some cases. Or at least fun,<br/>so stop complaining.</p></div>
