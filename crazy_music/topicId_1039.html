This may well have been Vicentino&apos;s temperament for his<br/>_archicembalo_ or &quot;superharpsichord&quot; dividing the octave into 31<br/>conceptually equal parts or &quot;minor dieses&quot; each equal to about 1/5 of<br/>a tone.</p><p>In this type of tuning, the usual diatonic semitone (e.g. E-F, B-C) is<br/>considerably larger (~117.11 cents) than the chromatic semitone<br/>(~76.05 cents) -- in 31-EDO, precisely 3/5-tone and 2/5-tone. These<br/>large diatonic semitones are a usual feature of 16th-century music.</p><p>However, what Vicentino sometimes practices and what Darreg strongly<br/>recommends is using the more narrow or compact chromatic semitones at<br/>or around 2/5-tone in cadential progressions, making these directed<br/>progressions more efficient and decisive.</p><p>As Darreg writes in XHB 9 in reference to 31-EDO:</p><p>   Some demonstrations of meantone were not readily appreciated<br/>   because of the flatness of the leading-tone. That&apos;s easy--<br/>   just play the tone 1/31 of an octave higher-- never mind what<br/>   it&apos;s called! Never mind either, if this melody-note you are<br/>   sharpening will therefore clash with a note in the accompaniment<br/>   which harmonic sense demands you NOT sharpen. It will work<br/>   anyway! Have a little imagination. Try it; you&apos;ll like it.</p><p>Here&apos;s a link to the complete issue, which I understand Brian McLaren<br/>has most generously made available via the World Wide Web:</p><p>        &lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/darreg/XHB9.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/darreg/XHB9.htm</a>&gt;</p><p>What Vicentino does in some of his compositions and examples involving<br/>fifthtones, and what happens in some cadences in my piece also, are<br/>shifts of a fifthtone or diesis at a cadence permitting the use of<br/>this narrower semitone together with the usual vertical concords of<br/>meantone.</p><p>For those curious about how this is musically pulled off, a score of<br/>my piece might help. Here I should explain that an asterisk (*) shows<br/>a note raised by a fifthtone or diesis, in my tuning 128:125 (~41.06<br/>cents); Vicentino used a dot above a note to show this inflection.<br/>There are also apostrophe (&apos;) signs while I&apos;ll explain a bit later,<br/>but here it&apos;s the fifthtone inflections that are most relevant.</p><p>The piece is notated in what I might describe as a kind of 2/2 meter,<br/>and a comma (,) in the line of numbers and bars showing the rhythm<br/>indicates the conclusion of a phrase:</p><p>                                                                7<br/>   1    2   | 1    2   | 1   2  | 1   2  | 1    2  +  | 1   2  | 1   2 ,|<br/>   G#4        A4   A4    A4       A4       A4           A4       G#*4<br/>   E4         E&apos;4  E&apos;4   F4       E&apos;4           D4 C4   D4       E*4<br/>   B&apos;3        C&apos;4  C&apos;4   C&apos;4      C&apos;4      A3           A3       B*&apos;3<br/>   E3         A3   A3    F3       A3       F3           F3       E*3</p><p>   1    2  +   | 1     2    +   | 1   2  | 1   2  | 1    2  +  | 1   2  |<br/>   G#*4.

Or,<br/>more precisely, that&apos;s what happens in the version I play on a 24-note<br/>meantone keyboard (see below for an extra &quot;surprise&quot;).</p><p>With this diesis shift, the semitones F3-E*3 and D4-C#*4 are around<br/>2/5-tone instead of 3/5-tone (F3-E3, D4-C#4) -- and the whole-tone<br/>steps A3-B*3 and D4-E*4, interestingly, are 1/5-tone wider than usual,<br/>at a size of around 6/5-tone, rather close to 8:7.</p><p>The _total_ expansion from a major third to a fifth, or from a major<br/>sixth to an octave, remains about 8/5-tone, or the sum of these two<br/>motions -- but here produced by combining narrow semitone steps of<br/>2/5-tone and wide whole-tone steps of 6/5-tone, rather than the usual<br/>steps of 3/5-tone and 5/5-tone.</p><p>Anyway, that&apos;s the solution to the &quot;puzzle.&quot;</p><p>Here I should add that those apostrophe symbols in the score show a<br/>different and smaller kind of inflection also described by Vicentino:<br/>raising certain notes by a quartercomma (~5.38 cents) to obtain pure<br/>fifths (3:2) and minor thirds (6:5) as well as major thirds.</p><p>In modern terms, this would be called &quot;adaptive JI.&quot; As it happens,<br/>Vicentino&apos;s own keyboard with 36 notes per octave could support<br/>_either_ a 31-note cycle of fifthtones plus a few extra notes for<br/>these pure adaptive JI sonorities, _or_ a system focused on pure<br/>sonorities based on a 19-note meantone range (Gb-B#).</p><p>However, using 21st-century technology, it&apos;s possible to model a<br/>version of Vicentino&apos;s germinal ideas combining both tuning systems<br/>for a single piece, permitting fifthtone inflections and pure<br/>sonorities. A player harpsichord or organ a la Nancarrow could do it<br/>also, with enough notes per octave.</p><p>Anyway, it&apos;s a great pleasure to honor Nicola Vicentino and Ivor<br/>Darreg while maybe providing a bit of diversion with my &quot;puzzle.&quot;</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=1044 href="#1044">ðŸ”—</a>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/13/2001 6:56:12 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, everyone, and recent discussions about chromaticism and<br/>adaptive tuning have suggested to me a &quot;test&quot; presenting some<br/>chromatic music in adaptive JI -- and also making available some MIDI<br/>files of historical pieces which people might retune in various ways.</p><p>Here I want to focus specifically on 16th-century European music in an<br/>authentic 16th-century adaptive JI system -- Nicola Vicentino&apos;s, based<br/>on a regular meantone tuning with very small melodic shifts to get<br/>purely concordant sonorities as defined in a Renaissance setting: pure<br/>fifths at 3:2 and minor thirds at 6:5, as well as major thirds at 5:4.</p><p>This system evidently uses very small melodic adjustments involving<br/>two versions of the same note about 5 cents apart -- more on this<br/>below for the curious.</p><p>One striking feature of meantone chromaticism is the unequal size of<br/>the semitones: the large diatonic semitone (e.g. E-F, B-C) is around<br/>117 cents, while the small chromatic semitone (e.g. F-F#, Bb-B) is<br/>around 76 cents. That&apos;s a difference of a full 41 cents, about<br/>1/5-tone, an interval known as an enharmonic diesis (e.g. G#-Ab).</p><p>While Vicentino also uses this diesis or &quot;fifthtone&quot; as a melodic<br/>interval -- one of his distinctive contributions as a xenharmonicist<br/>-- I&apos;ve decided for these &quot;tests&quot; to stick to the (relatively) more<br/>&quot;usual&quot; chromaticism. One reason is that fifthtone progressions tend<br/>to take center stage, and people sometimes confuse them with the much<br/>smaller adaptive JI adjustments.</p><p>Here&apos;s the first &quot;test,&quot; or sample, a chromatic setting of _Alleluia:<br/>Haec dies_ which Vicentino included in his treatise of 1555. My<br/>adaptive JI version is something that could be played in theory on<br/>Vicentino&apos;s harpsichord or organ with 36 notes per octave, but is much<br/>easier to do with MIDI:</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmaval1.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/qcmaval1.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>For the curious, I should explain that to tune his instrument for<br/>adaptive JI, Vicentino first places the 19 notes of the lower manual<br/>(Gb-B#) in a usual meantone -- likely 1/4-comma, with the fifths and<br/>minor thirds 1/4 syntonic comma (~5.38 cents) narrower than pure, so<br/>that four tempered fifths form a pure 5:4 major third.</p><p>Next each note of the upper manual -- ideally 19, but Vicentino could<br/>only fit in 17 on his actually instruments -- is tuned at a &quot;just<br/>fifth&quot; to a note on the lower manual. For example, we might take C4<br/>(middle C) on the lower manual, and tune G4 on the upper manual to its<br/>pure fifth.</p><p>This note would be 1/4 comma, or 5.38 cents, higher than G4 on the<br/>lower manual. Vicentino uses a &quot;comma sign&quot; looking like an apostrophe<br/>(&apos;) to show this difference -- at least as one of its meanings, so we<br/>can refer to the pure fifth C4-G&apos;4 -- C4 on the lower manual, G&apos;4 on<br/>the upper manual.</p><p>The idea of this system is for the player to mix notes from the two<br/>manuals so as to get pure concords -- e.g. C4-E4-G&apos;4-C4, with the<br/>upper note of the fifth C4-G&apos;4 and of the minor third E4-G&apos;4 raised by<br/>1/4-comma. Let&apos;s call this a &quot;quartercomma&quot; adjustment.</p><p>Similarly, in a sonority like F&apos;3-A&apos;3-D4-A&apos;4, the lower note of a<br/>fourth (A&apos;3-D4) or major sixth (F&apos;3-D4) is raised by a quartercomma to<br/>give a pure ratio of 4:3 or 5:3.</p><p>One further technological innovation might have made Vicentino&apos;s JI<br/>system a practical as well as theoretical triumph: some kind of<br/>&quot;player harpsichord&quot; or &quot;player organ&quot; that could automatically choose<br/>the right notes. For a human player, in real time, mixing the right<br/>notes from the two keyboards with any consistency would be difficult<br/>at best. However, using _some_ just sonorities could have a very<br/>striking effect, with usual meantone intervals at other points.</p><p>With MIDI files and pitchbends, it&apos;s a great system for Renaissance<br/>music; I&apos;ve felt free to avoid quartercomma shifts in places where<br/>they might cause complications, for example where a shift would be<br/>required in the middle of a single sustained note.</p><p>Also, I&apos;d want to emphasize that Vicentino&apos;s system is based on<br/>Renaissance music and styles; with music based on major thirds at 9:7<br/>rather than 5:4, for example, an adaptive JI system would obviously<br/>have different patterns.</p><p>Maybe my main point is that &quot;chromaticism&quot; can mean different things<br/>in different cultures and eras. For the European Renaissance variety,<br/>Vicentino&apos;s adaptive JI is a neat solution, and it&apos;s a pleasure to<br/>give people a chance to hear it.</p><p>Again, I welcome anyone who would like to use this MIDI file as a<br/>basis for other tunings or adaptive retunings, for example a variable<br/>adaptive system like that of John deLaubenfels.</p><p>In peace, inviting some exciting and friendly dialogue,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
