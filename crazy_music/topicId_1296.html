I&apos;ve been working on various things and<br/>putting it off until I had something more to share.</p><p>(re: crackling embers)</p><p>&gt; [Pete] This is really gorgeous. ...  More, please!  :-)</p><p>Hi Pete and Paul,</p><p>Thanks; I&apos;m glad you liked it. A lot of people have liked this one and it&apos;s<br/>even being used during the morning news on an LA radio station. Wow.</p><p>&gt; [dc yelps] I like it very much.</p><p>Hi Yelps: Thanks! And thanks for posting links to your own music.</p><p>&gt; Windows Media Sound file requires Windows Media player 9 or above and<br/>&gt; Broadband connection</p><p>Unfortunately, I am not able to play wma files as I have neither Windows nor<br/>broadband - still poking along here, lucky to get a 14,400 baud connection<br/>with all the phone line noise. I can do mp3s though and some oggs<br/>(apparently not all though).</p><p>&gt; [Paul] That was beautiful.<br/>&gt; ... Here&apos;s a link to the title track from my CD, which I just finished.</p><p>Thanks Paul! That&apos;s a nice and interesting track. 5tET is such an extreme<br/>case and yet it is surprisingly workable, which is amazing.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Here&apos;s another work that is in the same general direction: a bit slower and<br/>more contemplative than much of the energetic, frentic work of the last<br/>album.</p><p>I hoped to write more prose about this one and the details of what is<br/>happening, but for now I&apos;ll just have a few notes.</p><p>&quot;Saturn Rising in the Early Morning on Titan&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.nonoctave.com/tunes/SaturnRisingOnTitan.mp3">http://www.nonoctave.com/tunes/SaturnRisingOnTitan.mp3</a></p><p>Saturn Rising is composed in my own Celestial Interference, a tuning based<br/>on the 14th root of 12:7.</p><p>I&apos;ve done many pieces is this tuning and I am realizing that it has a very<br/>special character that unifies all the pieces composed with it. It is<br/>earthy, gurgling, primal, tribal, icey, organically alien. This new piece is<br/>powerful and crystallizes the nature of this tuning.</p><p>As you probably all know, the Huygens probe successfully landed on Titan on<br/>January 14th - the first landing on any alien moon with an atmosphere. It<br/>was named after Christiaan Huygens, who, more than three centuries ago, was<br/>the first to propose that light was a wave. He also discovered Saturn&apos;s moon<br/>Titan, and as a microtonalist, discovered and advocated 31 tone equal<br/>temperament for use as a meantone tuning based on a 2^18:31 generator.</p><p>Comments are welcome and appreciated.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>ambassadorbob &#x3C;peteysan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/21/2005 7:40:03 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In <a href="mailto:crazy_music@yahoogroups.com">crazy_music@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;X.
