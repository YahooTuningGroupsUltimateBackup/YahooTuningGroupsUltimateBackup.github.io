Electra<br/>&gt; nonesuch explorer series 972044-2 Which has singing that<br/>&gt; interpolates the larger intervals. The french label Ocora<br/>&gt; also has 4 volumes of Javanese music, but is probably harder<br/>&gt; to find.</p><p>Seconded. The Explorer CD is a great introduction and<br/>was well recorded by Bob Brown, Director of the Center<br/>for World Music in San Diego. The recording dates from<br/>1971 and the gamelan was directed by Pak Chokro (K.R.T.<br/>Wasitodinigrat).</p><p>For a great CD of Wasitodinigrat&apos;s lifetime body of<br/>work (he is considered by many to be the greatest<br/>living Javanese composer), do not miss &quot;The Music of<br/>K.R.T. Wasitodinigrat preformed by Gamelan Sekar<br/>Tunjung&quot; - released in 1992 on CMP Records, CMP CD<br/>3007. I heard the first track being played in a<br/>&apos;Chinatown&apos; scene (!) on a TV crime show only last<br/>week.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
