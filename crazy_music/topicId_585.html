The 7-limit tuning makes that<br/>brass sound great. I like this piece -- it reminds me a<br/>lot of &quot;La Derniere Rhumba&quot;.</p><p>You did a good job of finding a genre and orchestration<br/>that goes well with 7-limit, I must admit.</p><p>But -- it&apos;s one of those auto-accompaniment gizmos<br/>right??</p><p>------------</p><p>Monz,</p><p>The Bulgarian choir song sounds considerably better<br/>with the new recording, but I must say the voice patch<br/>is still pretty lousy with the super-obvious looping. I<br/>admit I don&apos;t have any really good voice patches<br/>either. Did the (original) Kurzweil 250 have some realy<br/>good choir patches or am I imagining it? Anyone have<br/>one of these old beasts or can recommend a good vocal<br/>synth? What about the formant/physical modelling<br/>synthesis approach? Anyone ever have good results going<br/>that way?</p><p>(What&apos;s the deal with choir anyway everyone -- is it<br/>impossible to got a good effect without using a real<br/>choir? Probably wouldn&apos;t be a problem to get a real<br/>choir... I bet most of us could work up a deal with a<br/>local high school band director to do a little<br/>experiment. Just a matter of some diplomacy there. Or<br/>get together a few friends who can sing like Jacky does<br/>with such excellent results &amp; maybe do a trade.)</p><p>Anyway, back to the song -- the new recording does<br/>remove the super duper distracting element of the<br/>previous recording and now I can hear the 11-limit<br/>tuning. Not too bad. Kind of interesting. I do think<br/>it&apos;s improving but seems like it still needs some work<br/>on the sequencing end with the phrasing or something?<br/>Anyone else think this too or am I just out here by<br/>myself?</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
