This process is expected to take one to two years, at which<br/>point the new computers will be made available to the public. Although<br/>special development machines are now available for testing, the Intel Macs<br/>will feature completely new Intel chips that are not yet available to<br/>anyone. Rumors are that these chips will be 64-bit, multi-core, very fast,<br/>low power and other desirable features. If they are indeed multicore and are<br/>priced competitively, this will be a substantial advantage to the Mac and to<br/>musicians since the Mac kernel is much more attuned, by design, to work with<br/>multiple processors than the Windows kernel. OS X will not work on standard<br/>PC hardware but will still require special hardware fine tuned by Apple for<br/>maximum performance.</p><p>Apple has provided directions on how to port applications to the new<br/>architecture and the Li&apos;l Miss&apos; Scale Oven (LMSO) port to Intel should not<br/>present any major problems. Anyone who purchases LMSO starting now will be<br/>eligible to upgrade to LMSO Intel when it is available.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>- Jeff<br/>-------------------------<br/>Red Barn Goat Farm<br/>Mac Tuning Software<br/><a href="http://www.nonoctave.com/">http://www.nonoctave.com/</a></p></div>
