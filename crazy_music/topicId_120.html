Membership is open.</p><p>Posts to this list will be uncensored to the greatest possible degree;<br/>let the reader beware!  I would draw the line at some extremes, however,<br/>including threats of physical violence, and perhaps particularly lurid<br/>profanity.</p><p>I would ask that individual posters limit daily input to a level which<br/>will not clog my 33K phone line.  If you can&apos;t say it in 500 lines,<br/>consider hiring an editor!</p><p>My goal is not to promote discord or extreme language; far from it!  My<br/>hope is that, through discourse and exchange of ideas, however rough and<br/>tumble, people might come to understand each other better.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/7/2001 1:27:32 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; A well-known member of the microtonal community, who has recently been<br/>&gt; involved in another list, now defunct, has made it known that he wants<br/>&gt; to come back online and air his views.</p><p>Well... he should do so by all means.

He posted on tuning_gossip, and at least one member<br/>off-list expressed a wish not to have him there.
