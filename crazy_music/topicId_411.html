How much<br/>room do you need?</p><p>&gt; Do we have any kind of agreed time limits on how long to<br/>&gt; leave music in the files section?</p><p>The rule is that when it gets to the point where it is<br/>almost full people who have large (ie: mp3) files<br/>should start removing them, perhaps in reverse date<br/>order.</p><p>If any one has some especially large posts they are<br/>planning to make and needs a bunch of room, make an<br/>announcement and wait a couple days or you can try to<br/>contact me.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
