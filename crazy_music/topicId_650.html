In any case,<br/>I think that I&apos;m starting to like the title &quot;JI moonie&quot;, and may decide<br/>to keep it and wear it with pride.</p><p>You express frustration that people don&apos;t read all your posts carefully<br/>from beginning to end.  I would suggest that this would be much more<br/>likely to happen if:</p><p>   . your posts were more brief.</p><p>   . your posts didn&apos;t spend so much time explicitly insulting people.</p><p>Speaking of reading other people&apos;s posts, did you happen to read the<br/>rest of mine?  I accepted your challenge for a blind tuning preference<br/>experiment, and asked if you have any suggestions as to piece(s) to<br/>include in such a test.</p><p>If you have no preference, I will pick piece(s) and post them.  If you<br/>think my choices have biased the results in some way, we can repeat the<br/>experiment with piece(s) you or others suggest.</p><p>I think that I&apos;ll start with Albeniz&apos;s &quot;Tango&quot; rather than something<br/>pre-19th century.  Please let me know if you have some other suggestion.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
