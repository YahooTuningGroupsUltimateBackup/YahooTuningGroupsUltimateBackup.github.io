Terhardt&apos;s theory basically<br/>revamps Rameau&apos;s theory of the &quot;basse fundamental&quot; and<br/>spit-shines it with Fourier Transforms.  In a nutshell,<br/>Terhardt hypothesizes that the human ear/brain system<br/>operates entirely by Fourier (that is, spectral) analysis<br/>and that musical consonance therefore consists of 2<br/>parts: so-called &quot;harmonic consonance&quot; (which is nothing<br/>more than Rameau&apos;s &quot;basse fundamentale&quot; under a new name)<br/>and virtual pitch purported produced by pattern recognition<br/>acting on a spectral analysis of the harmonies concerned.<br/>   Sadly, Ernst  Terhardt&apos;s theory of human hearing<br/>fails the test of experiment:</p><p>   &quot;However, predictions based on Terhardt&apos;s theory<br/>of harmonic consonance are not met. According to<br/>Terhardt&apos;s (1977) theory, the relative ambiguity of<br/>the &grave;fundamental root&apos; of the triad denotes the degree<br/>of perceived consonance or dissonance. Our analysis<br/>of equal-tempered major, minor, diminsihed, and augmented<br/>triads indicated that the fundamental pitch of the major<br/>triad is totally unambiguous whereas the fundamental<br/>pitches of the other three triads are about equally<br/>ambiguous. Clearly Terhardt&apos;s model does not account<br/>for the data.&quot; [Roberts, Linda A. and Marilyn L. Shaw,<br/>&quot;Perceive Structure of Triads,&quot; Music Perception,<br/>Vol. 2, No. 1, 1984, pg. 108]</p><p>    Naturally Paul Erlich does not realize this, since<br/>he cites Terhardt&apos;s theory as though there existed no<br/>disproof of its predictions.  In Terhardt&apos;s outdated<br/>theory from the 1970s, the sole action of the human<br/>auditory system is alleged to be Fourier analysis. Other<br/>auditory effects--such as virtual pitch--Terahrdt tries<br/>to argue out of existence as  &quot;secondary sensations&quot; derived<br/>entirely from Fourier analysis.<br/>   To derive virtual as a so-called &quot;secondary sensation,&quot;<br/>Ernst Terhardt offers an algorithm for extracting virtual<br/>pitch from the spectrum of the harmony. Unfortunately,</p><p>   &quot;The predictions of the algorithm, calculated<br/>from the formulas given in Terhardt et al. (1982),<br/>are shown in Fig. 14.  The figure shows predictions<br/>for -4% and +4% mistuning; the predictions for other<br/>values of mistuning actually used in our experiments lie<br/>ebtween the curves for -4% and +4%.  The algorithm<br/>predicts a shift for zero mistuning (harmonic<br/>complex), approximately midway between curves for<br/>-4% and +4%, although Peters et al. (1983) did not<br/>find such shifts.<br/>    &quot;Comparing the predicted shifts with the observed<br/>shifts shows that he algorithm correctly predicts<br/>the trends of the data when the mistuning is positive.<br/>When te mistuning is negative, however, the algorithm<br/>fails completely. Experimentally, negative mistuning<br/>usually leads to negative pitch shifts.  By contrast,<br/>the algorithm predicts positive pitch shifts for negative<br/>mistuning. (..)  The fact that [Terhardt&apos;s] algorithm fails<br/>so badly for negative mistuning suggests that there is<br/>something quite wrong with the idea that pitch shifts<br/>are mainly determined by partial masking.&quot; [Hartmann,<br/>W. M., McAdamas, S., and Smith, B. K., &quot;Hearing a Mistuned<br/>Harmonic In An Otherwise Periodic Complex Tone,&quot;<br/>J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 88, No. 4, 1990, pg. 1722]</p><p>    Naturally Paul Erlich fails to mention either of these<br/>crucially important experimental disproofs of Ernst<br/>Terhardt&apos;s outdated 1970s theory of hearing because, in<br/>the grand Yale tradition, Paul Erlich is too arrogant<br/>to realize that experimental tests of Terhardt&apos;s theory<br/>of hearing have disproven Terhardt&apos;s theoretical predictions<br/>BOTH for &quot;harmonic consonance&quot; AND for the virtual pitch algorithm.<br/>Erlich is also too ignorant of the psychoacoustic literature<br/>to realize that Terhardt&apos;s antique 1970s theory of hearing<br/>fails other important listening tests, and of course<br/>Paul Erlich is too incompetent as a scholar to be<br/>aware of the post-1970s modern literature on the<br/>human ear/brain system which has moved beyond Ernst<br/>Terhardt&apos;s obsolete theory.</p><p>   If we look at more modern citations from the psychoacoustic<br/>literature than the musty antique results from 1952 and 1971<br/>cited by Erlich, we quickly discover that the experiments I<br/>discuss above are not the only ones which disprove Terhardt&apos;s<br/>theory.  Other experiments for which Terhardt&apos;s theory fails to<br/>accurately predict results include those documented in:<br/>&quot;Pitch of Components of a Complex Tone,&quot; Peters,<br/>R. W., Moore, B. C. J., and Glasberg, B.R., Journal of<br/>the Acoustical Soc. Am., Vol. 73, 1983, pp. 924-929.</p><p>   So not only does Terhardt&apos;s theory badly fail the test<br/>of 3 different basic psychoacoustic experiments (op cit.),<br/>Terhardt&apos;s entire theory of virtual pitch as a &quot;secondary<br/>effect&quot; (allegedly derived from the operation of the basilar<br/>membrane) ignores a significant body of psychoacoustic<br/>evidence.<br/>   This body of evidence from the modern post-1970s<br/>psychoacoustic literature points to the operation of<br/>temporal mechanisms of pitch perception...  Moreover,<br/>there exists a  large amount of modern evidence *against*<br/>the place theory as a valid explanation for human hearing<br/>throughout much of the musical range.<br/>   Why, for instance, doesn&apos;t the ear seem to use<br/>basilar membrane information to detect pitch<br/>below about 500 Herz?<br/>   Terhardt (and Paul Erlich) deals with this serious<br/>problem by ignoring it.<br/>   Yet the experiments are striking. They have given<br/>us important information about the ear/brain system.<br/>   They cannot be ignored.<br/>   David M. Green performed some of the most crucial<br/>experiments in 1970. In that experiment, Green found<br/>that  &quot;waveforms having identical energy spectra were<br/>generated using a technique developed by Huffman.<br/>A pair of such waveform differ only in their<br/>phase spectra.  The discriminability of such<br/>waveforms was measured under various<br/>conditions.  (..) The results of these experiments<br/>suggest that the ear can discriminate differences<br/>in temporal order as small as 2.5 msec.&quot; [Green,<br/>D. M. and Patterson J. H.,  &quot;Discrimination of Transient<br/>Signals Having Identical Energy Spectra,&quot;  J. Acoust.<br/>Soc. Am., Vol. 48, No. 4, pp. 894-905]<br/>   Green&apos;s experiments show clearly and unambiguously<br/>that the ear can reliably discriminate between a waveform<br/>and its time-inverse. But if this is the case,<br/>then clearly the ear is not using Fourier analysis<br/>in that frequency range -- since a waveform and its<br/>time-inverse have exactly identical Fourier magnitude<br/>spectra.<br/>   Clearly, below 250 Hz the human ear does not detect<br/>pitch via frequency analysis. Instead, it uses time-based<br/>analysis.<br/>   Green&apos;s experiments, along with many others, offer<br/>proof positive that the human ear MUST use time-based<br/>analysis throughout much of the audible range.  Moreover,<br/>Green&apos;s experiments (along with many others) prove<br/>conclusively that below about 250 Hz the ear uses ONLY<br/>time-based analysis to detect pitch and process<br/>sounds.<br/>   Terhardt&apos;s model of the ear as a spectrum analyzer with<br/>virtual pitch produced as a &quot;secondary effect&quot; cannot<br/>explain Green&apos;s experiments, nor can it explain Newman<br/>Guttman&apos;s series of experiments from 1960 and 1961.<br/>   How does Terhardt deal with these serious problems<br/>in his theory?<br/>   Terhardt ignores them.<br/>   Other, more reputable, investigators have not ignored<br/>these serious problems with Terhardt&apos;s theory.<br/>   John R. Pierce details some of the overwhelming<br/>and extensive evidence that the ear uses time-based<br/>methods of analysis (as well as spectral analysis) in &quot;The<br/>Science of Musical Sound,&quot; 2nd ed., 1992, pg. 149.<br/>See also &quot;Tone Segregation by Phase: On the Phase<br/>Sensitivity of the Single Ear,&quot; Kubovy and Jordan,<br/>J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 66, No. 1, 1979, pp. 100-<br/>106.<br/>   As Kubovy and Jordan point out, &quot;This tone-<br/>segregation by phase raises doubts concerning several<br/>current theories of pitch perception. (..) Insofar<br/>as these results support temporal fine-structure<br/>theories of pitch perception, they are incompatible<br/>with the theories of pitch perception we cited<br/>at the beginning of this paper (Goldstein, 1973;<br/>Terhardt, 1973; Wightman 1973b).&quot; [op cit., pp. 102-3]<br/>   Notice that Kubovy and Martin *specifically*<br/>identify Terhardt&apos;s, Wightman&apos;s and Goldstein&apos;s<br/>models of human hearing as *incompatible* with their<br/>experimental results.<br/>   Other embarrassing problems with Terhardt&apos;s<br/>Fourier theory of consonance include an unwonted<br/>sensivity to the phase of high harmonics in<br/>determining the virtual pitch of the tone complex.<br/>According to Terhardt&apos;s theory, the ear/brains system<br/>should ignore phase, but in fact phase is vitally<br/>important to determining fundamental pitch below<br/>500 Hz and above about 5000 Hz.<br/>   In fact, interestingly enough, the ear&apos;s reliable<br/>pitch discrimination ends at exactly the point at<br/>which the ear&apos;s time-based analysis mechanisms poop<br/>out...namely, for fundamental frequencies above 5khz.<br/>This evidence strongly suggests that time-based<br/>mechanisms of analysis are not only present, but<br/>absolutely indispensible, for the detection of<br/>pitch throughout the audible range.<br/>--<br/>   Further proof of the presence of time-based<br/>pitch mechanisms (and thus disproof of Terhardt&apos;s<br/>model) of human hearing comes from John R.<br/>Pierce.<br/>   Pierce points out that:<br/>   &quot;Investigations of just noticeable differences<br/>(jnd&apos;s) of pitch continue to indicate the<br/>plausibility of two &grave;pitch mechanisms,&apos; the first<br/>operating on resolved harmonics, and the second<br/>&apos;periodicity pitch&apos; mechanism on unresolved<br/>clusters of harmonics (Houtsma and Smurzynski, 1990)<br/>as discussed earlier by de Boer (1976). (..)<br/>   &quot;The shape of the curve of jnd versus pulse rate<br/>suggests a transition between two mechanisms between<br/>62.5 and 500 pulses per second.<br/>   &quot;Such a transition is supported by experiments on<br/>matches between periodic all-positive pulses and<br/>periodic patterns of positive and negative pulses,<br/>carried out by Flanagan and Guttman (1960), Guttman<br/>et al. (1964), and Rosenberg (1966). At low frequencies<br/>the match is on pulse rate; at higher frequencies the &apos;<br/>match is on fundamental frequency.&quot; [Pierce, J. R.,<br/>&quot;Periodicity and Pitch Perception,&quot; J. Acoust. Soc.<br/>Am., 90 (4), October 1991, pg. 1989]</p><p>   The failure of the ear&apos;s Fourier analysis below<br/>250 Hz to account for observed pitch perception<br/>is a long-standing weakness of place theories of<br/>hearing, and since Terhardt&apos;s theory is a pure place<br/>theory it fails to explain all these important<br/>psychoaacoustic results.  Once again, Ernst<br/>Terhardt deals with these problems by ignoring<br/>them. Terhardt&apos;s many papers never mention<br/>or explain the results of Guttman &amp; Newman&apos;s<br/>1960 experiments. Terhardt&apos;s paper never mentions<br/>or explains the results of David M. Green&apos;s 1970<br/>experiments. Terhardt&apos;s paper never mentions or<br/>explains the results of Kubovy &amp; Jordan&apos;s experiments.<br/>   Ask yourself:<br/>   Would you believe a scientific theory against which<br/>considerable scientific evidence has been amassed,<br/>if the author of that theory never bothered to<br/>discuss or even acknowledge all the contrary<br/>scientific evidence?<br/>   This is what Ernst Terhardt has done.<br/>   While Terhardt prefers to ignore the results of<br/>all these experiments, reputable psychoaucistics<br/>researchers cannot. These experiments cannot be<br/>ignored because they&apos;re crucial to our<br/>understanding of the presence of periodicity<br/>mechanisms of pitch perception.<br/>   One of the most serious problems for a theory<br/>of place-type pitch perception like Terhart&apos;s<br/>(in which time-based auditory mechanisms of pitch<br/>perception are conjured away with smoke and mirrors<br/>and labelled as &quot;secondary sensations&quot;) is that while<br/>a purely spectral Fourier analysis model gets<br/>central processor models are forced on us, nonetheless<br/>phase remains crucially important to the perception<br/>of pitch below about 250 Hz and above 5000 Hz.<br/>A central processor model of some kind is<br/>forced on us by the finding that<br/>dichotic harmonics 3, 4 and 5 are most important to<br/>the perception of virtual pitch. For more details, see<br/>Ritsma, R. J., &quot;Frequencies Dominant in the<br/>Perception of the Pitch of Complex Sounds,&quot; J. Acoust.<br/>Soc. Am., Vol. 42, 1967, pp. 191-198;  also Plomp, R.,<br/>&quot;Pitch of Complx Tones, J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 41,<br/> 1967, pp. 1526-1533) and particularly the finding<br/>by Houtsma and Goldstein (1972) that 2 successive<br/>simultaneous harmonics with frequencies nf[o] and<br/>(n+1)f[o] are presented to different ears they evoke<br/>a fundamental pitch percept equally as effect as<br/>a monotic or diotic presentation of the same two<br/>harmonics.<br/>   The fact remains, however, that despite the<br/>requirement for some sort of central processor<br/>processor model to explain the above results,<br/>phase remains crucially important to the perception<br/>of pitch below 250Hz and above 5000 Hz.  But phase<br/>is a time-based auditory mechanism.  And whenever<br/>phase becomes important in pitch perception, by<br/>definition the mechanism of hearing which detects<br/>phase must be temporal and not spectral.<br/>   Moreover, in an intriguing experiment in which &quot;the<br/>perception of musical pitch was investigated in<br/>postlinguistically deaf subjects with cochlear implants,&quot;<br/>the pure periodicity theory of hearing received a shot<br/>in the arm.  &quot;Within a range of low pulse rates, subjects<br/>defined the intervals mediated by electrical pulse<br/>rate by the same ratios which govern musical intervals<br/>of tonal frequencies in normal-hearing listeners.<br/>It may be concluded that tempral cues are sufficient<br/>for the mediation of musical pitch, at least for<br/>the lower half of the range of fundamental frequencies<br/>commonly used in music.&quot; [Pijl, S., and Schwartz, D. W. F.,<br/>&quot;Melody Recognition and Musical Interval Perception by<br/>Deaf Subjects Stimulated with Electrical Pulse Trains<br/>Through Single Cochlear Implant Electrodes,&quot; J. Acoust.<br/>Soc. Am., 98(2), August 1995, pg. 886]<br/>    This provides strong evidence in favor of a strictly<br/>temporal mechanism of pitch perception  at low frequencies.<br/>If you directly stimulate the auditory nerve periodically,<br/>by definition the nerve is receiving only periodicity<br/>information. The fact that subjects hear recognizable<br/>sounds with cochlear implants disproves conclusively<br/>Ernst Terhardt&apos;s claim that time-based processing<br/>does not occur in the auditory range spectacularly fails<br/>to account for this evidence, which cannot be conjured<br/>out of existence as &quot;secondary senstions&quot; -- since<br/>direct electric stimulation of the auditory nerve<br/>produces ONLY time-based representations of acoustic<br/>stimuli, with NO place stimulation of the basilar<br/>membrane whatsoever.<br/>   Paul &quot;All Boasts, No Scholarship&quot; Erlich&apos;s reliance<br/>on Terhardt&apos;s 20-year-old disproven theories of hearing<br/>remains puzzling, since all contemporary computer<br/>models of human hearing have systematically abandoned<br/>Terhardt&apos;s Fourier analysis paradigm for the operation<br/>of the human ear/brain system.<br/>   Instead, in D. P. W. Ellis&apos; 1996 &quot;Prediction-Driven<br/>Comptuational Auditory Analysis,&quot; unpublished PhD thesis,<br/>MIT, 1996 and Eric David Sheirer&apos;s &quot;Computer Listening<br/>Systems,&quot; unpublished PhD thesis, MIT, 1999,<br/>Terhardt&apos;s 20-year-old outdated and disproven<br/>pure Fourier analysis model of human hearing<br/>fails so many crucial tests that both Sheirer and<br/>Ellis abandoned Fourier analysis entirely as a<br/>mechanism for analyzing acoustic inputs to their<br/>computer listening systems.<br/>   Instead, both Ellis and Sheirer use autocorrelograms<br/>in their computer listening systems. By following James<br/>Moorer in his earlier 1975 Stanford PhD thesis &quot;On the<br/>Analysis and Segmentation of Real-Time Musical Sounds,&quot;<br/>in which Moorer abandoned Fourier analysis as unworkable<br/>(because even slight changes in the transfer function<br/>caused by room acoustics produced unacceptable alternations<br/>in the Fourier spectrum of the input sound), both Daniel<br/>Ellis and Eric Sheirer have found themselves forced to<br/>throw out Fourier representations of the human ear/brain<br/>system in favor of time-based models of the human<br/>ear/bain system based on some form of autocorrelation.<br/>    As Eric Sheirer points out in his thesis, despite<br/>an entire book written by Richard Parncutt based on<br/>Terhardt&apos;s theory of human hearing, no one has yet<br/>tested Terhardt&apos;s hearing algorithm with real-world<br/>musical inputs (as opposed to artificial bleeps and<br/>bloops generated by computer). And as mentioned above,<br/>those of Terhardt&apos;s general predictions which *have*<br/>been tested, systematically *FAIL.*</p><p>    Bottom line?<br/>    By clinging to Terhardt&apos;s 30-year-old pure-Fourier-<br/>analysis model of human hearing, which has failed at<br/>least 3 different important psychoacoustic tests, Paul<br/>&quot;All Speculation, No Scholarship&quot; Erlich once again<br/>shows us the gross inadequancy of his knowledge of<br/>psychoacoustics.<br/>   If we look at a more recent reference on psychoacoustics<br/>to sum up the evidence, as opposed to Paul &quot;All outdated<br/>references, no modern results&quot; Erlich&apos;s antique 1971 and<br/>1952 citations, we find that:</p><p>   &quot;Several theories have been proposed to account for<br/>residue pitch. Theories prior to 1980 may be divided<br/>into two broad classes. The first, spectral theories,<br/>propose that the perception of the pitch of a complex<br/>involves [Fourier analysis followed by] a pattern<br/>recognizer which determines the pitch pitch of a<br/>complex involves [Fourier analysis followed by] a<br/>pattern recognizer which determines the pitch<br/>of the complex from the frequencies of the unresolved<br/>components (Goldstein 1973; Terhardt 1974). (..)<br/>   &quot;The alternative, temporal theories, assume that<br/>pitch is based on the time pattern of the waveform at a<br/>point on the basilar membrane responding to the higher<br/>harmonics.  (..) For these theories, the upper unresolved<br/>harmonics should determine the pitch that is heard.<br/>   &quot;Some recent theories (spectro-temporal theories)<br/>assume that both frequency analysis and time-pattern<br/>analysis are involved in pitch perception (Moore 1982,<br/>1989; Srulovicz and Goldstein 1983; Patterson 1987;<br/>Yost and Sheft, Chapter 6.&quot; [Yost, William A., Arthur N.<br/>Popper and Richard R.

Ask yourself -- which results<br/>are more likely to be correct: outdated antique<br/>citations from 1971 and 1952...or more modern psycho-<br/>acoustic experimental results from 1984 and 1987 and<br/>1993 and 1995 and 1996 and 1999?</p><p>    [3] Lastly, notice that J. L. Goldstein is the same<br/>author Paul Erlich quotes to support his disproven<br/>and debunked &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; scheme. But Goldstein<br/>cooked up his subsequent spectro-temporal theory in<br/>the 1990s to patch the glaring holes in his 1973<br/>central processor theory--namely, Goldstein&apos;s complete<br/>inability to explain experiments like those summarized in<br/>David M. Green&apos;s 1970 paper.</p><p>    In fact Goldstein&apos;s early theory (which Erlich is so<br/>fond of citing) is so inadequate that Goldstein himself<br/>had to deep-six and come up with a better theory,<br/>so many and so serious were its problems.</p><p>    &quot;Frequency difference limens are very much smaller<br/>than critical bands. Two mechanisms are possible.<br/>For instance, the subject may detect shifts in the<br/>place of excitation of the cochlea.  This is called the<br/>&apos;place theory.&apos;  Or he may use temporal information. We<br/>know that the firing in the auditory nerve is phase-locked<br/>&apos;place theory.&apos;  Or he may use temporal information. We<br/>know that the firing in the auditory nerve is phase-locked<br/>to the stimulus waveform up to about 5 khz. In this<br/>theory, called the &apos;temporal&apos; [that is, &apos;periodicity&apos;] theory,<br/>the subject discriminates the two tones by using the<br/>time interval between the neural firings. It is not clear<br/>which of the two mechanisms is used. Indeed the controversy<br/>has been active for more than 100 years, and the fact<br/>that it is not yet settled shows that we still do not<br/>have adequate evidence.  Auditory physiologists<br/>divide into three groups, namely those that think<br/>only temporal information is used, thouse that think<br/>only place information is used, and an eclectic group,<br/>who suppose that temporal information is used at<br/>low frequencies, and only place information at high.&quot;<br/>[Pickles, J. O., &quot;An Introduction to the Physiology of<br/>Hearing,&quot; Academic Press, 2nd ed., 1988, pg. 271]<br/>--<br/>   By placing excessive reliance on Terhardt&apos;s disproven<br/>9170s theory of human hearing -- which systematically<br/>contradicts  the psychoacoustic data in a number of cases,<br/>as cited -- Paul Erlich has yet again proven himself a<br/>true Yale graduate. As we all know, arrogance combined<br/>with ignorance and incompetence is the true imprimatur of<br/>a Yale education, and in all respects Erlich has upheld the<br/>low standards of that intellectual sewer known as Yale<br/>with his parting post.</p><p>  So let&apos;s see what we&apos;ve got here...<br/>  Paul Erlich drags in the corpses of dead disproven<br/>antique theories from the psychoacoustic literature<br/>from 1971 and 1952...even while he systematically<br/>ignores a host of more modern psychoacoustic theories<br/>and psychoacoustic experiments (op cit.), including<br/>Eric Sheirer&apos;s and Daniel Ellis&apos; 1999 and 1996 PhD<br/>theses on computer models of the human ear/brain system.</p><p>   And T*H*I*S is what Paul Erlich describes as being<br/>&quot;a perfectionist&quot; in his theories...?<br/>--<br/>   At this point it behooves us to move on to the<br/>larger issue of the dead antique superstition which<br/>Paul Erlich styles &quot;harmonic entropy.&quot;<br/>   To put it as simply as possible, &quot;harmonic entropy&quot;<br/>asks the question: What is the smallest integer ratio<br/>an isolated dyad will be heard as?<br/>   The problem with using this scheme as any kind<br/>of measure for real music in the real world is<br/>obvious, and it was discussed in detail by Leonard<br/>B. Meyer in 1956:</p><p>   &quot;The attempt to explain and understand music as<br/>a succession of separable, discrete sounds and sound<br/>complexes is the error of atomism. (..) For the tested<br/>pleasure-displeasure reactions are not what most of<br/>the psychologists tacitly assumed them to be: they are<br/>not universals (good for all times and all places) but<br/>products of learning and experience. (..) Attempts to<br/>explain the effect of the minor mode of Western music,<br/>to cite but one example, in terms of consonance and<br/>dissonance or in terms of the harmonic series have<br/>resulted in uncontrolled speculations and untenable<br/>theories. Even those not thus haunted by the ghost<br/>of Pythagoras have contributed little to our<br/>understanding of musical meaning and its communication.<br/>For, on the whole, music theorists have concerned<br/>themselves with the grammar and syntax of music<br/>rather than with its meaning or the affective<br/>experiences to which it gives rise.&quot;  [Meyer, Leonard<br/>B., &quot;Emotion and Meaning in Music,&quot; The University<br/>of Chicago Press: Chicago, 1956, pp. 7-8]</p><p>    Naturally since this reference dates from 1956,<br/>Paul Erlich is unaware of it.  Presumably this<br/>reference is too modern and too futuristic for<br/>Erlich to have read -- Erlich appears to prefer<br/>psychoacoustic research done in 1952 (!).</p><p>    Of course L. B. Meyer is not the only music theorist<br/>who has pointed out the crass and obvious logical error<br/>in efforts like Paul Erlich&apos;s doomed attempt to extract<br/>meaningful musical information from a numerical measure<br/>of the acoustic smoothness or acoustic roughness of<br/>isolated musical intervals:</p><p>   &quot;Helmholtz, Wundt, Stumpf, and other psychologists...<br/>based their inquiries on the assumption that music was a<br/>form of _pleasurable sensation_...this gave rise to an<br/>aesthetic based on liking and disliking, a hunt for a<br/>sensationist definition of beauty... But beyond a<br/>description of tested pleasure-displeasure reactions to<br/>simple sounds or elementary sound complexes...this<br/>approach has not taken us very far.&quot; [Langer, Suzanne<br/>K., &quot;Philosophy in A New Key,&quot; Mentor Book Co.: New<br/>York, 1951]</p><p>    Paul Erlich&apos;s concept of &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; is<br/>nothing more a mathematical operation on &quot;simple sounds<br/>or elementary sound complexes&quot; inteded to yeild a measure<br/>of acoustic smoothness -- which is to say, the degree to<br/>which that isoalted sound complex produces a pleasurable<br/>sensation when heard in total isolation.<br/>    But even the least competent musician instantly<br/>recognizes the utter folly of the attempt to mathematically<br/>gauge the purported &quot;pleasurable sensation&quot; produced<br/>by a dyad or a chord heard in total isolation -- the<br/>effort is foolish and inevitably doomed because in real<br/>music we NEVER heard dyads or chords in total isolation.<br/>We NEVER judge dyads or chords solely by the purported<br/>&quot;pleasurable sensation&quot; they produce when heard in<br/>total isolation...instead, listeners A*L*W*A*Y*S judge<br/>dyads and chord according to the musical context in<br/>which they occur.</p><p>     &quot;One reason for the difficulty has been an initial<br/>assumption of distinct sensory atoms in perception. Even<br/>in the study of judgments of isolated intervals, pure<br/>tones have been consistently used--tones which may have<br/>a laboratory value, but which are not found in music.<br/>Musical perceptions do not arise from tones, they arise<br/>from structural relations among tones. The relations<br/>cannot be uncovered by observing and measuring response<br/>to isolated interval-qualities.&quot; [Cazden, Norman, &quot;Musical<br/>Consonance and Dissonance: A Cultural Criterion,&quot; Journal<br/>of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, Vol. 4, No. 1, 1945,<br/>pg. 4]</p><p>     &quot;Historically, there have been two major difficulties<br/>with the treatment of consonance and dissonance. First,<br/>many writers have equated consonance with pleasantness<br/>and dissonance with unpleasantness; and second, judgments<br/>of consonance and dissonance have sometimes been made<br/>to isolated sounds and sometimes to sounds presented<br/>in a musical context.&quot;  [Gulick, W.

A theory of harmony,<br/>based on the facts of acoustics as a branch of physics...<br/>was accepted by academic musicians because musical illustrations<br/>of its tenets could readily be found in music of the classical<br/>period. In turn the theorist clung to his speculations because<br/>they earned the approval of academic musicians.<br/>     &quot;The fallacy of the theory, from the point of<br/>view of music, is obvious: it considered chords as things<br/>in themselves, existing timelessly, with no reference<br/>to what had gone before, and little to what was to<br/>come after.&quot; [Lloyd, L. S., &quot;Helmholtz and the Musical<br/>Ear,&quot; Musical Quarterly, Vol. 5, 1939, pg. 170]</p><p>    &quot;Perceptions of interval qualities, though they do not<br/>arise on natural foundations, are neither arbitrary nor<br/>accidental. They are conditioned responses derived from<br/>the structural relations of a specific musical language<br/>and its history. (..) Thus the materials of musical art<br/>are not to be discovered in natural phenomena taken in<br/>isolation, in tones and the responses to them, but in<br/>the more complex systems of tonal relations which are<br/>the historical products of human culture. These systems<br/>cannot be reduced to their constituent elements without<br/>losing their essential properties as organized wholes,<br/>and without losing their human context.&quot; [Cazden, Norman,<br/>&quot;Musical Consonance and Dissonance: A Cultural Criterion,&quot;<br/>Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, Vol. 4, No. 1,<br/>1945, pg. 10]</p><p>   As the crowning disproof of Erlich&apos;s claim that<br/>the &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; measurement has any valid<br/>musical meaning, the fact that the relative musical<br/>effect of a chord depends on its musical context<br/>was experimentally proven all the way back in 1945:</p><p>    &quot;According to Helmholtz&apos;s well-known theory,<br/>the consonance or dissonance of a chord depends on<br/>the extent to which its component fundamental tones<br/>and their overtones produce beats. Even a cursory<br/>study of the methods of musicians, however, and the<br/>experience of listening to music, make it seem<br/>possible that in actual practice the degree of<br/>harshness of dissonances varies considerably according<br/>to the way in which they are used and on their<br/>context of surrounding chords. A short experiment<br/>was planned to test this possibility. (..) From<br/>these data it must be inferred that the dissonance<br/>of a chord depends even more upon the relation in<br/>which it stands to its surrounding chords than on<br/>the nature of the chord itself. The objection might<br/>be raised that the subjects were simply judging the<br/>dissonance (or consonance) of given chords in<br/>comparison with more (or less) dissonant chords<br/>on either side of them. This objection, however,<br/>is met by the results for settings C and F, which<br/>consisted of the test chord itself, transposed one<br/>tone up or down.&quot; [Gardner, P. A. D. and R.

Erlich probably recognizes that<br/>his &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; scheme fails in so many ways, on<br/>so many levels, that he must cast his fishing line all<br/>the way back to the 1950s to scavenge plausible-sounding<br/>citations from the psychoacoustic literature, for the<br/>more modern results would conclusively debunk his<br/>&quot;harmonic entropy&quot; scheme.<br/>      We are likewise now in a position to see why Erlich<br/>clings with such a death grip to the antique debunked<br/>1970s theory of human hearing advanced by Ernst Terhardt.<br/>      Erlich&apos;s theory is based on such obsolete 19th<br/>century notions about music (viz., Wundt&apos;s &quot;pleasure/pain&quot;<br/>model of music as a mere series of acoustical sensations)<br/>that only a theory of human hearing as antique as Terhardt&apos;s,<br/>based solely on Fourier analysis, will support such an<br/>obsolete conceptual structure.<br/>     More modern theories of the human ear/brain system,<br/>such as those advanced by D. P. W. Ellis and Eric Sheirer<br/>(1996, 1999, respectively, op cit.), which abandon Fourier<br/>analysis, imply strongly that melody and musical context<br/>prove far more important than the acoustic properties of<br/>dyads and chords considered as isolated entitities.<br/>     Since Erlich&apos;s laughable &quot;harmonic entropy&quot; superstition<br/>boils down to precisely the effort to numerically calculate<br/>the acoustic properties of dyads and chords considered as<br/>isolated entitities, it stands to reason that Erlich must<br/>embrance Terhardt&apos;s obsolete 1970s theory of hearing and<br/>systematically ignore more modern and more accurate<br/>spectrotemporal theories of hearing based on<br/>context-sensitive prediction-driven computations of<br/>time-domatin autocorrellograms.<br/>--------<br/>    Lastly, it might prove interesting to know why<br/>Paul Erlich mentions the &quot;central pitch processor&quot; theories<br/>of Wightman and Goldstein when discussing &quot;harmonic<br/>entropy.&quot;   These were hybrid theories which became<br/>fashionable about 25 years ago in a number of guises.<br/>Erlich dredges up Goldstein&apos;s and Wightman&apos;s central<br/>processor theories of hearing from the early 1970s<br/>because Erlich desperately needs to find a way to<br/>boil all of music down to a single numerical measure<br/>(like the one implied by his &quot;harmonic entropy&quot;).<br/>    However, it might also prove interesting to<br/>learn that Goldstein offers one version, Wightman<br/>another, more recently (in 1991) Meddis and Hewitt:<br/>&quot;Virtual Pitch and Phase sensitivity of a computer model<br/>of the auditory periphery,&quot; I &amp; II, 1991, J.<br/>Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 89., pp. 2866-2894.<br/>Wightman&apos;s pattern transformation theory<br/>suffered a severe blow in 1979--see A. J. M.<br/>Houtsma, &quot;Musical pitch of 2-tone complexes<br/>and predictions by modern pitch theories,&quot;<br/>J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 66, No. 1, July 1979,<br/>ppg. 87-98.</p><p>   &quot;Among the three popular pitch theories only<br/>the optimum processor theory [Goldstein&apos;s]<br/>is able to account for most of the data<br/>is a quantitative sense.  The virtual pitch theory,<br/>which in its original formulation can account for<br/>most phenomena only in a qualitative sense, can<br/>be brought into quantitative agreement with most<br/>experimental results through some modifications<br/>which make it yield results very similar to the<br/>optimal processor theory.  The pattern transformation<br/>theory was found to be significantly less supported<br/>by empirical results, especially by results obtained<br/>with successive harmonic two-tone complexes that<br/>were already available in the literature. Attempts to<br/>find a suitable modification of this theory that would<br/>bring its predicitions and experimental results in<br/>closer agreement were not successful. None of the<br/>theories presently accounts in a quantitative way<br/>for the apparent constant rivalry between analytic<br/>and synthetic mode pitch perception which is always<br/>present in experiments that use complex tones.&quot;<br/>[Houstmas, A. J. M., op cit., 1979, pg. 98]</p><p>   And so Wightman&apos;s and Goldstein&apos;s models have been<br/>supplanted in the 1980s and 1990s by spatio-temporal<br/>theories of the kind exemplified by Eric Sheirer&apos;s<br/>model in &quot;Computer Listening Systems,&quot; unpublished<br/>PhD thesis, MIT, 1999, and Daniel P.
