Scott &#x3C;xjscott@...&#x3E;</h3><span>12/17/2003 9:26:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi all,</p><p>I&apos;ve just put the finishing touches on my second album release for this<br/>year.</p><p>The name of the new album is &quot;Zhxrghaenian Night Melodies&quot;, or &quot;ZRM&quot;.<br/>It contains ten compositions, totalling 53 minutes.</p><p>The songs were done entirely in realtime on the the Mac and all instruments<br/>used are softsynths, with one exception. I used more than 25 different<br/>softsynths and softsamplers to make the album. The album was recorded in<br/>both OS 9 and OS X. In OS 9, the retuning was done using LMSO and in OS X,<br/>the retuning was done using LMSO X.</p><p>The one exception to the &apos;all-softsynths&apos; is that I did use a Katagotan on<br/>one track, which is best described as a cross between a guitar and a koto.</p><p>Six of the ten pieces use nonoctave tunings. Two use Rational Intonation.<br/>All of the pieces use unusual tunings, one piece has timbres matched to the<br/>tuning used, three pieces make use of polymicrotonality. The moods range<br/>from meditative to frentic dance.</p><p>Here are the names of the tracks and the tuning used:</p><p>1  Nighttime<br/>   9th root of 7/3</p><p>2  Alligator Scamperizo<br/>   17tET</p><p>3  Ahrphck Zo Dance-Magic 2023<br/>   Celestial Interference</p><p>4  Sihnuan Gamelan<br/>   Pelog from Gamelan Gambang, Krobokan village</p><p>5  Synchronicity<br/>   11tET and 17tET</p><p>6  The Expanse Beneath<br/>   Celestial Interference</p><p>7  Sirius&sup1; Supper with his Troubled Brother<br/>   Ligon Harmonic Mirror #4 and Just Tritone w/spectrums matched</p><p>8  Inuition<br/>   88cET</p><p>9  Kaelenthe&sup1;s Lake<br/>   Ligon Harmonic Mirror #4</p><p>10 Echelon/Suns rise on Ilaxth<br/>   Celestial Interference, Just Tritone and Aleatoric Katagotan</p><p>The album is eminently listenable and most who have heard advance copies<br/>have been pleased with it. It&apos;s the sort of thing that would not overtly<br/>disturb a very conservative person, but on the other hand it might just blow<br/>the mind of someone who is extremely avant-garde. For persons curious about<br/>what is possible with nonoctave tunings, this will certainly be of special<br/>interest.</p><p>The album is available for $12. Shipping and handling are $3.<br/>Persons interested in obtaining this CD can just email me for details.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
