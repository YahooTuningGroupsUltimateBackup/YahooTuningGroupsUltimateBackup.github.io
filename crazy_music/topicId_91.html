I&apos;ve been here<br/>and there when you&apos;ve posted it previously and haven&apos;t been able to<br/>hear everything.  Listening to Hurdy Gurdy man now and really<br/>enjoying it.  Do they still have Hurdy-Gurdy men in England?</p><p>Also really like your notes.  Being rather untutored in the music<br/>theory it is really useful to read your very clear notes while<br/>listening _ I actually can hear what you are writing about, which<br/>makes me feel good.</p><p>Please keep adding to the page - it is a delightful place to visit.</p><p>Mary</p><p>PS  Does the ear training &quot;quiz&quot; you described to Joe work in your<br/>latest beta.  Tried following the instructions but didn&apos;t  find the<br/>quiz now popup.</p></div><h3><a id=93 href="#93">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>6/3/2001 1:58:25 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>On the spiritual tuning list there is a lot of talk about the<br/>qualities of each temperment.  For instance 17 has been suggested as<br/>horizontal, male and 111 has been described as &quot;perverse (my<br/>paraphrase).</p><p>I&apos;ve listened to Ricks and Roberts 17 TET pieces, and found one of my<br/>own I did about a year ago.</p><p>The common charactereistics I can find are celebration, play and a<br/>sense of excitement.   I can see that as &quot;horizontal&quot; which<br/>horizontal meaning human experience, and vertical meaning divine.</p><p>Does anyone else have some 17 TET pieces they can add.  Perhaps<br/>others can listen to all three and add their comments.  I really<br/>don&apos;t think there is a right and wrong way to experience the TETs,<br/>and from my perspective of music as a healing art I am interested in<br/>gathering more data on this topic.  If there is no objection I&apos;d like<br/>to add links to Roberts and Ricks 17 TET pieces to make it easier to<br/>hear all three.</p><p>I also found a piece I did within the last year in 111 TET.  Can<br/>others add their 111 TET&apos;s?  I am looking for 43 and 41 TET pieces of<br/>mine and also would welcome others.   It could be an ongoing group<br/>project to group similar TET pieces together, or similar limit pieces<br/>which seem to share common characteristics.</p><p><a href="http://www.elucida.com/Temperments.html">http://www.elucida.com/Temperments.html</a></p><p>MAry</p></div><h3><a id=95 href="#95">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/3/2001 4:58:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mary wrote...</p><p>&gt; Does anyone else have some 17 TET pieces they can add.</p><p>Yes, I have done some work in &quot;straight&quot; 17tET (i.e., non diatonic).<br/>Lemme see if I can post something for you soon.</p><p>BTW, as I mentioned before, the piece I posted is only up temporarily, so<br/>you may not want to link to it.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
