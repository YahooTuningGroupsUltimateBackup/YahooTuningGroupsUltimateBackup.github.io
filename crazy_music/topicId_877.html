As<br/>&gt; far as I can tell, Brian invented the idea of dynamic<br/>&gt; multidimensional latticing software and I hope to see<br/>&gt; him properly acknowledged someday for his contribution.</p><p>&gt; From: Kraig Grady &lt;kraiggrady@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:crazy_music@yahoogroups.com">crazy_music@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Saturday, August 04, 2001 7:27 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [cm] Re: compositional methods<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Yes credit to Brian<br/>&gt; And possibly a big footnote to John Whitney whose work implied such<br/>&gt; things!</p><p>Hi Jeff and Kraig,</p><p>While Brian and John Whitney certainly deserve props for any<br/>historical precedence, please take note, as Carl emphasized,<br/>that many of us have invented this wheel again separately and<br/>independently.</p><p>For the record, here&apos;s my history in this regard:</p><p>I finally began digesting the theory in Partch&apos;s _Genesis of<br/>a Music_ around 1982-83.  It would still be more than a decade<br/>before I knew anything of the work on lattice diagrams of<br/>Fokker, Wilson, Mandelbaum, Johnston, or McLaren.</p><p>By the fall of 1984 I was auditing a computer music class with<br/>Charles Dodge at Brooklyn College to try and figure out a way<br/>to animate Partchian Tonality Diamonds on the computer screen<br/>as a compositional and analytical tool.  I had already come up<br/>with the name &quot;JustMusic&quot; for the software project.</p><p>In the spring of 1993 I had the idea to plot a Partchian Tonality<br/>Diamond in a way that made the center of each of Partch&apos;s cells<br/>a point, and plot those points horizontally on a pitch-height<br/>graph, so that something resembling a 7-white/5-black keyboard<br/>pattern (but with slightly different geometry) could be painted<br/>under the Tonality Diamond points-and-line-segments. [I thought<br/>I had put a graphic of this on my website, but I don&apos;t see it<br/>and don&apos;t have it handy to create now.  Eventually.]  This<br/>&quot;keyboard&quot; diagram was to be part of the JustMusic on-screen<br/>interface, but I also wanted (and still want) to create an<br/>actual physical keyboard on this design.</p><p>Around March 1994, I realized that Ellis&apos;s Duodene diagram<br/>was a prime-factor matrix, and modified some of the different<br/>diagrams I had created based on Partchian Tonality Diamonds<br/>into what I called JustMusic Matrices.  I could only represent<br/>a 2-dimensional (i.e., two prime-factor) array of pitches<br/>on any given plane, and would stack other planes above and<br/>below it like a ladder to represent other prime-factors.<br/>This worked great for a 3-dimensional 7-limit system, but<br/>not so well for larger-dimensional tuning resources.  This<br/>too was to be a part of the JustMusic software interface.</p><p>Around the same time, I came up with the idea for my<br/>Planetary Graph, which plotted and 8ve as 360 degrees<br/>around the circumference of a circle, and all the 8ve-invariant<br/>microtonal pitches at points between.  Again, another<br/>JustMusic window.</p><p>Sometime later that year or thereabouts, I read the<br/>_Perspectives of New Music_ article by John Fonville<br/>describing Ben Johnston&apos;s notation, and saw the<br/>lattice diagram Fonville included.  So I realized that<br/>what I was creating should really be called a &quot;lattice&quot;,<br/>and also got some new ideas on how to use different angles<br/>(other than 90 degrees) to represent the relationships<br/>between the prime axes.</p><p>Then in May 1998, still having read nothing by McLaren<br/>or Erv Wilson, I was struggling with my own &quot;lattice barrier&quot;<br/>and finally thought of the formula described in my webpages,<br/>which finally gave me a way to lattice all the different<br/>prime-factors I had come across in my historical research<br/>(as I worked on my book from 1994-98) on the same huge<br/>conceptual lattice.  A year later, March 1999, with Ken Fasano&apos;s<br/>help, this actually became the primary window of the JustMusic<br/>software interface.  A year after that, John Chalmers showed<br/>me the JI Calc program Carter Scholz had written for the Mac,<br/>which was quite similar to what Ken and I had put together.</p><p>Meantime, around February of 1998, I had joined the Tuning List<br/>and gradually thruout 1998 became a little familiar with Wilson&apos;s<br/>work.  Around the same time I first saw Mandelbaum&apos;s thesis, describing<br/>Fokker&apos;s lattices.  So a little at a time at that point I was<br/>becoming familiar with the lattice ideas of others besides Johnston.</p><p>But the original idea to use animated tonal harmonic diagrams<br/>was entirely my own, back around &apos;84 or possibly &apos;83.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
