So, yes, do.</p><p>This is where it will be - so you can join straight<br/>away if you like - but I will repost the old messages (about<br/>three or four or somethign) and maybe edit the home page<br/>description before inviting the members from the old listbot list.<br/><a href="/fractaltunesmithy">/fractaltunesmithy</a></p><p>Actually not much happened in the listbot list as I used it to announce<br/>releases, and there were very few of these. No-one else could<br/>post because I just didn&apos;t think of that when setting it up. However<br/>with move to yahoo and letting anyone post, maybe it will become more active,<br/>we&apos;ll see.</p><p>&gt; Not in my scheme.  That would seem to require large pitch shifts<br/>&gt; for keys on the main keyboard (?).  In my scheme, choosing F simply<br/>&gt; indicates the pitch at which the sequence of intervals starting at<br/>&gt; 1/1 is centered.  The pitch can come from the control keyboard,<br/>&gt; in which case the total accessible tuning is limited to the cross<br/>&gt; set of the two scales, or it can come from the main keyboard, in<br/>&gt; which case the total accessible tuning is infinite.  All this<br/>&gt; will be made clear in the spec, which is half-finished as of 2am<br/>&gt; last night.  BTW, I do not mean to enforce my ideas with the spec...<br/>&gt; it&apos;s just that I need to make my ideas more clear, for myself, and<br/>&gt; if I intend to share them efficiently with others.</p><p>Okay fine. I&apos;ve got first approx of idea, look forward to the spec<br/>whenever you do it.</p><p>It will be a little while before I get down to coding this as I&apos;d<br/>like to mull it over first, but shouldn&apos;t take long once I do,<br/>the way everything is set up.</p><p>&gt; No, we don&apos;t want that... large pitch shifts of the main keyboard<br/>&gt; would make it very hard to play, and nothing more than a glorified<br/>&gt; version of a &quot;transposing keyboard&quot;... an idea hundreds of years<br/>&gt; old... though I&apos;m told Irving Berlin could only play in F#, and had<br/>&gt; a transposing keyboard to get around this!</p><p>Well, could include tra. keyboard as an option if it requires about two extra<br/>lines even if only maybe three people, or only one, ever uses it.</p><p>&gt;Correct -- that&apos;s my idea.  It&apos;s still just multiplication, except<br/>&gt;you&apos;re making sure to keep 1/1 on the same physical key on the<br/>&gt;main keyboard (there&apos;s a 1/1 in every scale in the tonality diamond,<br/>&gt;remember).  The possible pitches of every other physical key are<br/>&gt;then found on the diagonals of the diamond.</p><p>Okay fine. That makes sense.</p><p>&gt;&gt;However, with tonality diamond, with no note names to want to<br/>&gt;&gt;preserve, I think one would find it easier to navigate if the two<br/>&gt;&gt;keyboards were just the two axes of the diamond, and the note<br/>&gt;&gt;played was the product of the two.</p><p>&gt;Well, I&apos;ll disagree, but that doesn&apos;t mean I wouldn&apos;t like to<br/>&gt;try this method!</p><p>I&apos;ll prob. include it anyway if it is only going to be a few lines<br/>and a tick box. Could perhaps use it for exploring lattices too e.g.<br/>successive white keys of one keyboard go up 5/4, of another,<br/>3/2, etc. Or whatever,... Just a thought, don&apos;t know if that<br/>will be useful to do.</p><p>&gt; Yes -- hopefully for you too.  Thanks, Robert, for this highly<br/>&gt; productive discussion.</p><p>Thanks, Carl, I&apos;m finding it very productive too.</p><p>&gt; Why didn&apos;t I think of that?</p><p>My thought too when idea first came up. With hindsight, I may well<br/>have seen Matts&apos; posts or his web site first; I really can&apos;t remember<br/>the sequence now, but if so, it somehow didn&apos;t &quot;click&quot; at that point.<br/>He was certainly &quot;in there first&quot;.</p><p>It was a complete surprise when the idea did came up, apparently as<br/>a new thought: &quot;Why didn&apos;t I think of that before!&quot;.</p><p>I don&apos;t know anything about how he makes his midi files; but the<br/>basic idea is clearly identical.</p><p>&gt; I knew you used NWC, which I haven&apos;t tried in years, but I didn&apos;t<br/>&gt; know you used this technique!</p><p>&gt; I&apos;ve always used Breed&apos;s Midi Relay, but it has a key repeat<br/>&gt; bug, where notes revert to 12-tET.  How does FTS do?</p><p>FTS beta uses a least recently used algorithm for the pitch bends<br/>and for most midi relaying (unless it is non octave scale<br/>or something), you have at most one pitch bend<br/>message per channel in the whole piece.</p><p>(prev. release used another technique, but the teeny tuned<br/>sequencer was updated to use this technique too).</p><p>I&apos;ve not had any reports of it reverting to 12-tet. If there<br/>are any bugs reported I usually fix them pretty soon. Usually<br/>I&apos;ll fix a bug and re-upload it in a day or two unless I happen<br/>to be in the middle of an extensive overhaul of it, which I have<br/>been recently.</p><p>Never had any bug reports for midi relaying for the current beta<br/>(the january one).</p><p>Beta preview has better midi relaying in a few respects,<br/>+ multiple midi outports and other extra features, plus<br/>better layout of the program.</p><p>Did a complete overhaul of sections for the midi relaying.<br/>Had a few bug reports soon after that, and found<br/>some myself, and fixed them all. As far as I know it<br/>is all right now; no recent bug reports, and haven&apos;t come<br/>across anything recently of that type myself. But, will<br/>be running it in for a bit more as I have done some<br/>more changes to the midi relaying sections.</p><p>&gt; &gt; If non octave scale, may do it so that the non octave repeat is<br/>&gt; &gt;shown as &quot;octaves&quot; on the score.</p><p>&gt; Not sure what you mean here... why is octave repeating important?</p><p>Just because if one is used to reading the stave for 12-tet one<br/>is used to the notes an octave apart on the stave as &quot;the same&quot;,<br/>so might help one to get ones bearings if they are the &quot;same notes&quot;<br/>of the non octave scale; e.g. might choose to have the Cs as<br/>1/1 and multiples of it by the scale repeat, so that C is always<br/>degree 0 of the scale, D degree 1, and so on.</p><p>Nothing inherently readable about doing it that way, after all the<br/>octave leap on the stave is actually from a line to a space, and<br/>it would make more sense in a way to do, say, a six note scale as<br/>(line space line space line space) repeat.</p><p>One could prob. get used to that pretty easily.</p><p>Just habit.</p><p>&gt; Well, it just so happens I have a document for that purpose.<br/>&gt; Some of the links may have changed at the Wilson site, since<br/>&gt; Kraig went over to pdfs.  See also &quot;Janko keyboard&quot;, and the<br/>&gt; patents listed at <a href="http://www.daskin.com">www.daskin.com</a>.  Take some time to look<br/>&gt; into this one... I think you&apos;ll be interested.  To summarize:</p><p>Thanks, will do.</p><p>Already downloaded a couple of the pdfs from anaphoria<br/>to puzzle over!</p><p>I&apos;ve also done a web search for &quot;Janko keyboard&quot; in Google.<br/>Basic overview:<br/><a href="http://ubmail.ubalt.edu/~pfitz/play/ref/keyboard.htm">http://ubmail.ubalt.edu/~pfitz/play/ref/keyboard.htm</a><br/>which clearly describes what the Janko keyboard does,<br/>and some of its predecessors / antecedents to put<br/>it in context.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=1000 href="#1000">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>11/8/2001 4:48:18 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Joseph,</p><p>&gt; This has been around awhile.
