Once you fix your sampling rate, you get a number<br/>of artifacts. Interesting enough, no one appears to have<br/>done adaptive sampling rate change on the fly in<br/>hardwave (though you can zero-pad or interpolate fixed-sample-rate data aftterwards, but that&apos;s not the same<br/>thing, since you don&apos;t really increase the measurement<br/>refinement, you just recalculate).<br/>     Resampling might seem a pie-in-the-sky technique but<br/>radio telescopes spread out over the surface of the earth<br/>make massive use of it to resample to a nice square grid<br/>so as to inversely Fourier Transform the data for minimal<br/>artifacts.  CD production also requires resampling if you<br/>recorded the PCM encoded sound at 48 Khz and must<br/>resample to 44.1 kHz for CD production.<br/>     Incidentally, PCM encoding (AKA digital audio recording)<br/>is a time-domain method, like wave-counting. Linear PCM<br/>encoding remains the winner and still champeen for artifact-<br/>free recording methods, with spectral methods like minidisc<br/>a very poor alternative.<br/>     Checking through a bunch of the state-of-the-art spectral<br/>estimators a couple of years ago, I found that not one of &apos;em<br/>uses exclusively frequency-domain analysis. Moreover, not<br/>one of &apos;em is paramateric. All the state of the art spectral<br/>estimators use time domain methods along with frequency<br/>domain methods, typically in predictor-corrector toplogies likethe Runge-Kutta predictor-corrector partial differential equation<br/>solving method.  They&apos;re all non-parametric, too, which<br/>means the user typically must input some info, and the algorithm<br/>can possibly keep runinng forever (the user typically puts in<br/>some error bound or some runtime beyond which the spectral<br/>estimator retuns an error condition, which NEVER happens<br/>with parametric methods like the Fourier Trasnform).<br/>     THe big advantage, by the way, of non-parametric methods<br/>of spectral estimation is that they tyipcally give you an error residue<br/>which can be related to the accuracy of the analysis. You get<br/>this from LPC, for isntance, so LPC actually gives you a guesstimate<br/>of how well the input signal matched the assumed analysis<br/>parameter.  You *never* get a guesstimate of how well the<br/>input signal matched the basic assumpti8ons required by the FFT,<br/>however, but that&apos;s a trade-off, since the FFT is guaranteed never<br/>to keep running forever....unlike the LPC, an FFT will always<br/>run in N*log base 2 of the number of points and reach completion, guaranteed, absolutely, no doubt.  Non-parametric methods give you more info if they finish, but they might not, and might take quite a bit longer than you expected to run.  As usual, it&apos;s a trade-off.<br/>    Probably the best-known non-parametric method of<br/>spectral estimation is the maximum entropy method, AKA<br/>linear predictive coding. Like wavelets, LPC does not<br/>specify one particular required primitive set of orthogonal functions, so you can throw in anything you like after the fact to get neat<br/>different resynthesis options -- exchange noise for sine &amp; cosine<br/>and you get musically interesting results.<br/>-------------<br/>    Some of you, given the sobriquet &quot;keeping it real,&quot; may wonder<br/>what all this big-deal eerie theory math has to do with the real world.<br/>    Well, as Risset points out so eloquently, the musical utility of<br/>an analysis method is best determined by testing it through resynthesis.  If the resynthesis proves accurate, the analysis method probably fit the signal being analyzed. However, as Risset also points, there is no one ultimate method of analysis -- different methods seem to be required by different types of timbres..<br/>     This means that every method of analysis we have discussed has an overall &quot;sound,&quot; sort of like a synthesizer. Weird, but true...various set sof integrals and mathematical functions have an overall &quot;timbre&quot; or &quot;sound.&quot;</p><p>      The &quot;sound&quot; of Fourier analysis/resynthesis is denatured,  choirlike and strangely sterile in some cases or beautifully lucid (artificial but in a nice way) in others.</p><p>      The &quot;sound&quot; of linear predictive coding is typically buzzy and fuzzy with some strange distortion products and artifacts whenever the sound&apos;s frequency or amplitude changes noticeably</p><p>     The &quot;sound&quot; of subtractive synthesis is warm and hummy and low-pass-filtered</p><p>      The &quot;sound&quot; of non-linear analysis/resynthesis methods tends to be a little rat-pedal-distortion-like, as though a heavy metal guitar was playing the timbre analyzed</p><p>      The &quot;sound&quot; of Walsh analysis/resythesis is buzzy and almost clipped, as though digital clipping was larded onto the sound unless you use a WHOLE lot of Sal and Cal components</p><p>     The &quot;sound&quot; of FM synthesis is metallic and rubbery.</p><p>     Bottom line?<br/>      Since every method of synthesis has an overall &quot;sound&quot; that tinctures every timbre produced using that mathematical method, it follows that every method of mathematical analysis lends a certain distinctive timbral coloration to the sound in question. Best to bear this in mind when analyzing/resynthesizing.<br/>--------------<br/>     Many thanks to Robert Walker for his wonderful work (ongoing) with Fractal Tune Smithy. For some reason, the better sounding the synth, the more rigidly it&apos;s locked into 12. Robert Walker has finally let us break through that Catch-22.<br/>     Thanks also to John Starrett for posting all that superb info about free scientific calculation software.<br/>      Lastly -- some of you might find interesting the article on Widmer&apos;s work in data-mining virtuoso piano performances of Mozart by computer to find &quot;rules&quot; which make the performance of a MIDI file more humanlike.  Apparently he&apos;s getting good results.  Unlike the gibberish spewed out at IRCAM, this use of technology in music seems to produce some useful results.<br/>--------------<br/>--mclaren</p></div><h3><a id=1074 href="#1074">ðŸ”—</a>genewardsmith@...</h3><span>8/30/2001 1:50:40 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., xed@e... wrote:</p><p>&gt;       The &quot;sound&quot; of Fourier analysis/resynthesis is denatured,<br/>choirlike and strangely sterile in some cases or beautifully lucid<br/>(artificial but in a nice way) in others.</p><p>How would you characterize Bessel function analysis/resynthesis?</p></div>
