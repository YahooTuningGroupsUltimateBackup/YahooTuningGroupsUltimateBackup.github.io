Perhaps it&apos;s more fun this way, at<br/>least for a first reaction.</p><p>I found the file very interesting.  The sounds are of very high sonic<br/>quality and intriguing chordal textures.  I am at a bit of a loss to<br/>say whether the effect is more consonant or dissonant, which may be<br/>connected with the lesson we are meant to learn from this file (?).</p><p>The flow of change in this fragment is very slow, and perhaps that<br/>reflects its intended purpose.  I&apos;m guessing that a larger work might<br/>alternate with faster-moving passages, or at least that would be an<br/>option.</p><p>I look forward to hearing more, whenever that becomes possible.  Thanks<br/>for sharing!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
