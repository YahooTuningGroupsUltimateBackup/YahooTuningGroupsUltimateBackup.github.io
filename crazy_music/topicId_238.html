I&apos;ll pick throught this for bits I want to reply to.</p><p>&gt;         Once again, this approach represents the exact opposite of<br/>&gt; theory. Typically, theory involves a generalization about reality<br/>&gt; derived from observations of the world.   Thus theory goes from<br/>&gt; specifics to generalities. In other words, theory involves primarily<br/>&gt; induction -- large general principles grow from small individual<br/>&gt; facts.</p><p>That&apos;s an acceptable definition of theory, and exactly what you do below!</p><p>&gt; it is so incoherent and so ridiculously contrary to even the most<br/>&gt; basic elements of everyday musical experience. Viz., even a small<br/>&gt; child taking piano lessons knows that a musical interval&apos;s dissonance<br/>&gt; depends on its context, a fact which Schoenberg&apos;s so-called &quot;theory&quot;<br/>&gt; of music uttelry ignores.</p><p>I don&apos;t know of anything Schoenberg called &quot;theory of music&quot; but I did read<br/>&quot;Theory of Harmony&quot; and it certainly does not ignore this.</p><p>&gt;     So on every front, Schoenberg&apos;s bizarre and laughable claims have<br/>&gt; been systemtically disproven.  In every case, Schoenberg&apos;s kooky<br/>&gt; ideas audibly contradict the observable reality of actual music in<br/>&gt; the real world.</p><p>That&apos;s patently false, as Schoenberg&apos;s music itself exists in the real world.</p><p>&gt;     Of course much additional experimental evidence shows that JI<br/>&gt; tuning is not heard by most listeners as sounding optimal for<br/>&gt; standard Western music -- Terhardt and Ward&apos;s article &quot;Psychaoucsitc<br/>&gt; Comparison of Just vs. Equal Tempered Tuning&quot; from Acustica in 1974,<br/>&gt; Siegel &amp; Siegel&apos;s article &quot;Musicians Can&apos;t Tell Sharp from Flat&quot; from<br/>&gt; 1986, etc.</p><p>That imples that *some* listeners do find JI optimal, which is fine by me.<br/>What happened to Boomsliter and Creel?</p><p>&gt;     Unlike many other statements about microtonal tunings, the claim<br/>&gt; that each tuning has a bias either toward melody or toward harmony is<br/>&gt; not open to subjective interpretation. Ivor&apos;s and my definition is<br/>&gt; strict and simple, and produces reliably reproducible experimental<br/>&gt; confirmation by way of listening tests.</p><p>I had a hard time parsing that first sentence.  Not open to subjective<br/>interpretation?  Is that what you meant to write?  If so, what do listening<br/>tests have to do with it?</p><p>&gt;     Second, because psycoacoustics tells us that only tertian triads<br/>&gt; whose thirds exceed the critical band in interval width can produce<br/>&gt; smooth functional harmonies on octave inversion, only tertian triads<br/>&gt; made up of thirds wider than the critical band can qualify as<br/>&gt; generally fucntional smooth harmonies (since only such tertian triads<br/>&gt; made up of thirds wider than about 280 cents remain smooth on octave<br/>&gt; inversion).  This effect does NOT depend on warping the timbre, and<br/>&gt; cannot be changed by warping the timbre, since in this case the<br/>&gt; fundamental of at least one note of the triad will coexist in the<br/>&gt; same critical band with the root or the fifth of the triad on octave<br/>&gt; inversion, producing unacceptable acoustic roughness.</p><p>Now there&apos;s a generalization if ever I heard one!  So what&apos;s wrong with<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/cadence.mp3">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/cadence.mp3</a>&gt;?</p><p>&gt;     But this is not possible. In most of these equal temperaments<br/>&gt; even today, in the year 2001, the only existing compositions are<br/>&gt; those produced by myself and Ivor Darreg.  That is far far far too<br/>&gt; small an observational base upon which to build any kind of<br/>&gt; hypothesis.  We would be buidling a castle on quicksand, as so many<br/>&gt; other microtonal so-caleld &quot;theorists&quot; have done before us.</p><p>Oh, come come.  Why not draw the obvious conclusion?  Real music in the real<br/>world tells us these tunings are uninteresting.  That doesn&apos;t bother me,<br/>because I go by my ears.</p><p>&gt;     As a result, the time for theory has not yet arrived in<br/>&gt; microtonality.  Idle speculations about various tunings are<br/>&gt; meaningless and unproductive until composers build up a sufficient<br/>&gt; repertory of music in each of the ETs and JI limits and NJ NET<br/>&gt; inharmonic series for listeners to judge the audibel regularities and<br/>&gt; discern musical patterns which transcend the individual style of the<br/>&gt; composer.</p><p>Well, it depends what you mean by &quot;microtonality&quot;.  We have enough significant<br/>11-limit music from Harry Partch to construct a theory of Harry Partch&apos;s use of<br/>11-limit harmony.  What&apos;s wrong with that, or why isn&apos;t it &quot;microtonal theory&quot;?<br/> Books are written on Palestrina&apos;s use of counterpoint, that&apos;s considered<br/>respectable theory.  An individual style is good enough.</p><p>&gt;     Without that repertory of music in ET and JI and NJ NET tuning,<br/>&gt; idle speculations are as useless and as worthless as guesses about<br/>&gt; the constituent elements which make up the sun prior to the invention<br/>&gt; of spectrometry, or wild fantasies about the interior structure of<br/>&gt; the atom prior to the discovery of the electron and the atomic<br/>&gt; nucleus.</p><p>Guesses needn&apos;t be worthless.  You have to throw up a few crazy ideas before<br/>you spot the good ones.  Come on in, the water&apos;s lovely!</p><p>&gt;     To put it bluntly, we do not yet have remotely enough musical<br/>&gt; evidence in the form of actual compostions in each microtonal tuning<br/>&gt; for anyone to form meaningful hypotheses about the various ETs. This<br/>&gt; is why I don&apos;t do theory, and probably why Ivor didn&apos;t. Microtonality<br/>&gt; has not yet reached the stage where theory is even ready to begin.</p><p>Don&apos;t be silly, that&apos;s exactly the theory you indulged in above.  Claiming it<br/>isn&apos;t theory won&apos;t save it from being disproven when significant music gets<br/>written using strong cadences that don&apos;t involve recognizable IV-V-I<br/>progressions.</p><p>&gt;     To recap what every music historian and musicologist and<br/>&gt; competent musician already knows, throughout Western history music<br/>&gt; comes first and theory only later, afterwards. Musicians break rules<br/>&gt; and toss together musical structures ad hoc, by guessing, off the<br/>&gt; cuff. When these stabs in the dark prove msuically effective and<br/>&gt; enough composers start to use &apos;em, then theorists finally step in and<br/>&gt; try to explain things after the fact.</p><p>I&apos;m totally dubious about this.  It may be the definiton of &quot;music theory&quot; in<br/>which case that isn&apos;t what I&apos;m doing.  But I&apos;m sure theorizing went on.  The<br/>only difference between than and now is that we don&apos;t know who was doing the<br/>theorizing back then because it didn&apos;t get written down until after.</p><p>&gt;     Moreover, we will continue stuck at the butterfly-collecting<br/>&gt; stage as long as the internet allows unproductive spasms of theory<br/>&gt; and meaningless bouts of idle speculation involving magic numbers and<br/>&gt; mystic fantasies like the harmonic series as the purported basis of<br/>&gt; music.<br/>&gt;     In this regard the internet serves as a potent roadblock in the<br/>&gt; path of progress in microtonality. Right now we need more microtonal<br/>&gt; music -- more GOOD microtonal music...a LOT more good microtonal<br/>&gt; music...before the first theorist can even hope to step in and<br/>&gt; discern hidden patterns in the musical compositions in each tuning.</p><p>Blaming the Internet for the failure of your theories to catch on is as weak as<br/>not calling them theories.  Surely sex and drugs have a more powerful tendency<br/>to distract the would be microtonalist.</p><p>For myself, I have an X5D sitting in front of me, and to my right a TX81Z and<br/>a Capybara 320.  All of these are capable of making real microtonal music, in<br/>real time, and hence widen my knowledge of said.  I wouldn&apos;t have known of<br/>any of them but for the internet.  And my computer wouldn&apos;t have Scala loaded<br/>on it to help with the retuning.  Nobody else would have midiconv or MIDI<br/>Relay.  I wouldn&apos;t have the cassettes of papers you (Brian) so kindly sent me.<br/>Nor would I have the support and guidance of a microtonal community, leading me<br/>towards new tunings and ideas, sometimes even giving me feedback on my music<br/>(crucial if I&apos;m going to mature as a composer).</p><p>The older generation of microtonalists really underestimate the value of the<br/>Internet to those of us who would be isolated without it.  By spreading<br/>heretical ideas and music it is enormously useful in encouraging though and<br/>experiment.  That *will* lead to great music, give it time.</p><p>And I&apos;ve got news for you.  We&apos;re going to carry on with our theories and make<br/>all our own mistakes.  Maybe some of those will be mistakes you made yourself.<br/>Keep up with the positive wisdom, what you&apos;ve found works, what ideas helped<br/>you with your composition.  But you can&apos;t tell me what I hear is wrong.</p><p>&gt;     ---------<br/>&gt;     Several more important addenda:<br/>&gt;     Joe Monzo claimed that the wolf fifth in his Dowling tuning is<br/>&gt; 682 cents in width. This is not a wolf fifth. It is an entirely<br/>&gt; musically recognizable and musically function perfect fifth.</p><p>Redefining common words is bad enough, but attacking others for not second<br/>guessing your definitions is cranky.  The word &quot;wolf&quot; historically refers to<br/>the unique fifth in a twelve note meantone.  These &quot;wolves&quot; are much closer to<br/>the just fifth than 682 cents, and it&apos;s not being just that makes them wolves.<br/>The term is fully appropriate, by association, here.</p><p>&gt;     In another 4 days I&apos;ll post 2 fragments of pieces in 23 equal<br/>&gt; which show clearly and vividly that 23 equal can and does sound as<br/>&gt; though it has entirely functional p5ths. In another 4 days I&apos;ll<br/>&gt; delete all my current MP3 files from the files section. If you<br/>&gt; haven&apos;t downloaded &apos;em yet, get &apos;em in the next 4 days or they&apos;ll be<br/>&gt; gone to make room for other people&apos;s music.</p><p>I&apos;ll look forward to this.  It&apos;ll be interesting to hear how you theory becomes<br/>manifest.  Did you ever post the end of that high-limit JI piece?  It sounded<br/>quite good, but it&apos;s difficult to tell where it&apos;s heading from the excerpt I<br/>heard.  I am behind on MP3 listening again, so perhaps I missed it.</p><p>             Graham</p><p>&quot;I toss therefore I am&quot; -- Sartre</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2001 6:59:43 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: Graham Breed &lt;graham@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:crazy_music@yahoogroups.com">crazy_music@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Sunday, July 08, 2001 12:58 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [crazy_music] Re: The &quot;bias&quot; of a tuning<br/>     -- also, caveats about 22 and 23 equal</p><p>&gt; &gt; [Brian McLaren]<br/>&gt; &gt; Schoenberg claims that &quot;the higher we go in<br/>&gt; &gt; the harmonic series, the greater the dissonance of the intervals.&quot;<br/>&gt; &gt; Even a small child realizes this is foolishly and laughably wrong, as<br/>&gt; &gt; you can see by comparing the interval 11/9 with the interval 8/7.<br/>&gt; &gt; Once again, compare the interval 641/512 to the interval 11/10.

And please, before you whip out your citations from Thomson&apos;s<br/>_Schoenberg&apos;s Error_... I know that you&apos;re fond of backing up what<br/>you say about Schoenberg by quoting Thomson, but in my work-in-progress<br/>on the rational basis of Schoenberg&apos;s theory, I shred at least four<br/>or five of the major foundation points upon which Thomson bases his work.<br/>Chief among them is Thomson&apos;s insistence on treating consonance and<br/>dissonance as clearly separable phenomena, whereas Schoenberg adamantly<br/>maintained exactly the opposite.  Thomson himself apparently has<br/>misunderstood Schoenberg to a great extent, because he continually<br/>finds fault with alleged aspects of Schoenberg&apos;s theory which<br/>Schoenberg himself never believed in.</p><p>It&apos;s incorrect to state that &apos;Schoenberg claims that &quot;the higher we<br/>go in the harmonic series, the greater the dissonance of the intervals.&quot; &apos;<br/>He never said that.  What he said was that the *comprehensibility*<br/>of the ratios diminishes the higher up the overtone series one goes,<br/>because the numbers become larger, and it therefore takes more thought<br/>to determine the relationships, compared with, say, 2:1, 3:2, or 5:4.</p><p>And for another thing, he characterizes this whole aspect of his<br/>work as &quot;the possibly incorrect overtone theory&quot;, which he says<br/>he is making use of simply because it is a paradigm which his ear<br/>informs him is at least somewhat analagous to the way people perceive<br/>and manipulate harmony.  So he himself goes thru the trouble of<br/>questioning the relevance of the overtone theory, and decides<br/>to employ it after all only because he knows of no better analogy.<br/>(And that was simply because he never took the time to learn<br/>the basics about tuning math.  OK, I know... tuning has nothing<br/>to do with math...)</p><p>It&apos;s also necessary to view Schoenberg&apos;s _Harmonielehre_, especially<br/>the original 1911 edition, for the polemical tract that it most<br/>assuredly is.  Schoenberg was lashing out against music-theory<br/>stuck-in-the-muds like Riemann and Schenker who refused to admit<br/>that prime-factors higher than 5 had anything to do with music.<br/>Schoenberg was interested in assimilating the aesthetic effects<br/>of ratios utilizing 7, 11, and 13, and he viewed the resources of<br/>his new way of using the 12-tET chromatic scale as a way to do<br/>exactly that.</p><p>Really, with the major exceptions of the tuning and instruments<br/>they chose (not to mention the corporeal-vs-abstract business),<br/>Schoenberg and Partch had very similar ideas about expanding<br/>the possibilities of musical harmony.</p><p>So compare apples with apples instead of comparing your<br/>&quot;small child&apos;s&quot; perception of &quot;11/9 with the interval 8/7&quot;<br/>or &quot;641/512 to the interval 11/10&quot;.  Your perceptions of<br/>these intervals is going to be vastly different from Schoenberg&apos;s,<br/>because, for one thing, you&apos;ve *used* and *heard* these<br/>actual ratios and he never did.  (Yes, so *that&apos;s* the point<br/>you&apos;ve been nailing on the head which *does* apply to Schoenberg.)</p><p>I also have to take exception to what you (Brian) say about<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s compositions, as in this bit from<br/>Sunday, July 01, 2001 8:11 AM:</p><p>&gt; It doesn&apos;t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Arnold<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s music typically sounds like a combination of<br/>&gt; gang rape and vivisection sans anesthesia,</p><p>I don&apos;t know what Schoenberg pieces you&apos;ve listened to, and<br/>I will admit that some of his expressionistic stuff gets pretty<br/>wild (and that&apos;s the stuff of his that I like best of all),<br/>but really... the guy was a brilliant composer, and his music<br/>covers quite a range of emotional expression.  If you listen<br/>to a good performance of _Erwartung_ (and make sure it&apos;s a<br/>good one!), and try to put your perspective in line with what<br/>any regular listener in 1909 was used to, you&apos;ll quickly realize<br/>that Schoenberg was opening up tremendous new possibilities<br/>for musical expression with this piece.</p><p>&gt; &gt;     To recap what every music historian and musicologist and<br/>&gt; &gt; competent musician already knows, throughout Western history music<br/>&gt; &gt; comes first and theory only later, afterwards. Musicians break rules<br/>&gt; &gt; and toss together musical structures ad hoc, by guessing, off the<br/>&gt; &gt; cuff.

It may be the definiton of &quot;music theory&quot;<br/>in<br/>&gt; which case that isn&apos;t what I&apos;m doing.  But I&apos;m sure theorizing went on.<br/>The<br/>&gt; only difference between than and now is that we don&apos;t know who was doing<br/>the<br/>&gt; theorizing back then because it didn&apos;t get written down until after.</p><p>Throughout the history of music-theory, there are examples of both<br/>prescriptive and descriptive theory.  Whether or not one believes<br/>in the equal validity of both types, one cannot simply ignore<br/>the vast body of work written in the prescriptive tradition<br/>and pretend it doesn&apos;t exist.</p><p>&gt; &gt;     Joe Monzo claimed that the wolf fifth in his Dowling tuning is<br/>&gt; &gt; 682 cents in width.

Brian, I quote here for<br/>you something from my Dowland webpage, and if you visit the page<br/>and listen to the mp3 of Dowland&apos;s _Lachrimae_ *in his tuning*,<br/>I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll agree that &quot;there be wolves here&quot;:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/fngrbds/dowland/dowland.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/fngrbds/dowland/dowland.htm</a></p><p>&gt; One glaring example of these unusual intervals is the Eb chord<br/>&gt; which appears on the first beat of the 2nd measure. The score<br/>&gt; calls for a high Bb on the last beat of the 1st measure which<br/>&gt; is 15 5/9 cents flatter than 12-tET Bb. Then on the first beat<br/>&gt; of the next measure comes an Eb-Bb-Eb trine with pitches deviating<br/>&gt; from 12-tET by +10 1/6, +12 1/6, and -17 1/2 cents, respectively.<br/>&gt; So we have:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;                             frequency ratios<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Bb -15.6 &iuml;&iquest;&half;  |                 372  |<br/>&gt;             | Eb +10.2 &iuml;&iquest;&half;           |  252<br/>&gt;             | Bb +12.2 &iuml;&iquest;&half;           |  189<br/>&gt;             | Eb -17.5 &iuml;&iquest;&half;           |  124<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The top Bb forms a 3:1 ratio with the bottom Eb, and<br/>&gt; the middle Eb:Bb is a 4:3, so there are a Pythagorean<br/>&gt; &quot;12th&quot; (&quot;8ve&quot;+&quot;5th&quot;) on the outside and &quot;4th&quot; on the<br/>&gt; inside. But the &quot;4th&quot; on the inside is made of different<br/>&gt; pitches from the &quot;12th&quot; on the outside. The higher Eb<br/>&gt; forms a 31:21 ratio with the top Bb, and the lower Bb<br/>&gt; forms a 189:124 ratio with the bottom Eb.</p><p>And if that&apos;s not crystal clear, try this notation:</p><p>Bb =  2 8ves + ~284 cents<br/>Eb =  1 8ve  + ~810 cents<br/>Bb =  1 8ve  + ~312 cents<br/>Eb =           ~782 cents</p><p>The &quot;octaves&quot; here are ~1172.299664 cents for the Bb&apos;s<br/>and ~1227.700336 cents for the Eb&apos;s!</p><p>So I&apos;m not talking here about any &quot;implied functional 5th&quot; etc.</p><p>I&apos;m talking about one Eb:Bb &quot;5th&quot; that&apos;s ~674.2546651 cents,<br/>and a different Eb:Bb &quot;5th&quot; that&apos;s ~729.6553366 cents,<br/>BOTH BEING USED AT THE SAME TIME!!</p><p>If *that&apos;s* not wolves, then please tell me what is.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>David J.

There are such things<br/>as multi-port MIDI interfaces that simplify matters greatly.  You can make music every<br/>day, and go months without touching a MIDI cable.

Though I must admit, I got a huge kick out of Monz&apos;s suggestion<br/>that you make a MIDI-fied Partchian performance piece out of your man-vs.-machine<br/>struggles!</p><p>xed@... wrote:</p><p>&gt;     Unlike many other statements about microtonal tunings, the claim<br/>&gt; that each tuning has a bias either toward melody or toward harmony is<br/>&gt; not open to subjective interpretation. Ivor&apos;s and my definition is<br/>&gt; strict and simple, and produces reliably reproducible experimental<br/>&gt; confirmation by way of listening tests.<br/>&gt;     The idea of bias in a xenharmonic scale boils down to the fact<br/>&gt; that some ETs simply do have recognizable perfect fifths.</p><p>Fifths?  Who said anything about fifths?  &quot;Harmony&quot; she wrote.  Harmony vs. melody, not<br/>fifths vs. melody.</p><p>&gt; And any kind of I-IV-V-I cadence in the ETs 6 or 8 or<br/>&gt; 11 or 13 or 16 or 18 or 23 cannot and will not sound like a<br/>&gt; functional or musically conclusive cadence in these ETs.</p><p>Harmony = I-IV-V-I?  It ain&apos;t necessarily so.  There are many kinds of vertical<br/>progressions; not all of them require so much as even the concept of thirds and fifths.</p><p>&gt;     Bereft of musically conclusive tertian triads and standard<br/>&gt; tertian triadic progressions, the ETs without recognizable perfect<br/>&gt; fifths cannot establish a tonal center through standard Western tonic-<br/>&gt; dominant  and tonic-subdominant harmonic progressions. This leaves<br/>&gt; the composer with only 2 alternativces -- use weaker harmonic<br/>&gt; progressions such as I-III or I-VI to try to establish tonality, or<br/>&gt; use melody to establish tonality.<br/>&gt;     Hands-on experience composing and listening to the ETs without<br/>&gt; recognizable perfect fifths (6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 23) shows that the<br/>&gt; weaker  harmonic progressions like I-III-I and I-VI-I do not work<br/>&gt; effectively to establish final-sounding cadences, and do not work<br/>&gt; well to establish a sense of tonality, compared to traditional I-IV-V-<br/>&gt; I cadences in 12 equal.</p><p>You speak as if the term &quot;harmony&quot; were restricted to Western tonality.  Perhaps it would<br/>be better to substitute &quot;Western tonality&quot; for &quot;harmony&quot; to avoid confusion.</p><p>&gt;     Ivor&apos;s and my claim about bias therefore represents nothing more<br/>&gt; than a much simpler statement that &quot;some ETs do not have musically<br/>&gt; recognizable and functional perfect fifths.&quot;</p><p>That statement is as uncontrovertible as it is obvious, but it is not equivalent to the<br/>statement that some ETs are not suitable for harmony.  I&apos;m gonna get my psuedo-13 equal<br/>guitar out soon and upload some mp3s to show what I mean.</p><p>    -----</p><p>&gt;     Joe Monzo claimed that the wolf fifth in his Dowling tuning is<br/>&gt; 682 cents in width. This is not a wolf fifth. It is an entirely<br/>&gt; musically recognizable and musically function perfect fifth.</p><p>I thought the wolf fifth was historically defined as the fifth that one finds &quot;across the<br/>break&quot; on a keyboard tuned to a series of fifths.  In Pythagorean tuning, the wolf is 3:2<br/>less a Pythagorean comma, or about 678 cents - very close to 682.  And in the context of<br/>all those perfectly pure fifths, 678 sounds shockingly out of tune, even though it might<br/>sound perfectly acceptable when surrounded by fifths of similar size.  In twelve tone QC<br/>meantone, the standard keyboard tuning of Dowland&apos;s time, the wolf would be a sharp fifth,<br/>not a flat one, at about 738 cents, I think.  (Did I get that right?)  Of course, Dowland<br/>composed for the lute, not the keyboard, so his wolf might have been a modified<br/>Pythagorean type.</p><p>&gt; This points up why<br/>&gt; it&apos;s so important to get experience not just in one JI limit, or a<br/>&gt; bunch of different JI limits, but also in a variety of different<br/>&gt; ETs.  Unless you do, your understanding of how such basic things as<br/>&gt; perfect fifths work in various ETs will be incorrect and very badly<br/>&gt; crippled.</p><p>That&apos;s a true statement, taken by itself.  But Joe wasn&apos;t talking about various ETs, he<br/>was talking about Dowland, who composed for lute during the late Renaissance period.<br/>Surely, musical context should play some role in determining the tuning of a wolf?  The<br/>sizes of the thirds influence the perception of the consonance of the fifth in a tertian<br/>triad.  As you said:</p><p>&gt;     Although mathematically the perfect fifths of 9 equal should nto<br/>&gt; be musically functional, in reality they are. I can&apos;t explain why.<br/>&gt; But listeners agree: 9 equal&apos;s 666.666-cent perfect fifths function<br/>&gt; and sound, in the context of the 9 equal tuning, as musically<br/>&gt; effective perfect fifths.<br/>&gt;     You want weird?<br/>&gt;     In the context of the 18-equal tuning, 18&apos;s exact same 666.666-<br/>&gt; cent perfect fitghts DO NOT sound and DO NOT fucntion as musically<br/>&gt; effective p5ths. Unless -- 18 equal is used as 2 offset susbcales of<br/>&gt; 9 equal.</p><p>You said you can&apos;t explain why, and I can&apos;t offer a doctoral thesis on it, but it&apos;s<br/>obvious from hands-on experience that there&apos;s a synergy that goes into play with triads<br/>that causes their constituent intervals to be perceived differently than the same sizes of<br/>intervals heard as bare dyads.  That&apos;s at least the vague beginnings of an explanation.</p><p>   -----</p><p>&gt; When<br/>&gt; math comes in, the music goes out the window.</p><p>Say rather, &quot;when math leads the way in, or imposes itself rigidly, music goes out.&quot;  But<br/>when music comes in, math always comes sneaking in behind in its shadow.  As long as it<br/>stays in its shadow, all is well.  If math is forbidden to enter at all, music collapses<br/>into the chaos of indecipherable noise, or meaningless blathering.</p><p>--<br/>David J.
