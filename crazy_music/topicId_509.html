This demonstrates how poorly you<br/>understand Schoenberg&apos;s theory.</p><p>Schoenberg himself said in different words exactly what you<br/>say here: &quot;the 4:5:6 chord is irrelevant to and unimportant<br/>in real music in the real world [which Arnold Schoenberg<br/>is composing in 1910].&quot;</p><p>From Schoenberg 1911, _Harmonielehre_, p 356-357;<br/>Schoenberg 1978, _Theory of Harmony_, p 318-319:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Thus, for example, Heinrich Schenker ... as when he speaks<br/>&gt;&gt; of the &apos;mysterious number five&apos;, beyond which (if I remember<br/>&gt;&gt; correctly) we are not to go. A poetic thought, certainly,<br/>&gt;&gt; yet somewhat too poetic in the bad sense, since the real poet<br/>&gt;&gt; recognizes the truth; for that five is already far behind us.<br/>&gt;&gt; But this fact does not bother him. He wants the number<br/>&gt;&gt; five to remain mysterious.  Holding to this aim, he is not<br/>&gt;&gt; only blinded to reality, he also lets pass false and<br/>&gt;&gt; inexact observations; for otherwise this &apos;mysteriousness&apos;<br/>&gt;&gt; cannot be maintained.  The number five is of course, in<br/>&gt;&gt; itself, no less mysterious than all other numbers, nor<br/>&gt;&gt; is it any more mysterious. And, after all, such secrets<br/>&gt;&gt; as we uncover are either not secrets, or we&apos; have not<br/>&gt;&gt; uncovered hem. Whatever nature wants to hide from us,<br/>&gt;&gt; she conceals better than that. Aside from all that,<br/>&gt;&gt; however: the number five is supposed to be remarkable<br/>&gt;&gt; in that it shows up everywhere in music as a kind of<br/>&gt;&gt; boundary, for example (I don&apos;t remember everything),<br/>&gt;&gt; as the fifth overtone, and as the fifth tone of the scale,<br/>&gt;&gt; as the _Quint_. Yes, but who says then that the _Quint_<br/>&gt;&gt; has anything at all to do with five. Because we have given<br/>&gt;&gt; it the name, _Quint_? It is not really five on that account.<br/>&gt;&gt; In the overtone series, for example, it is the sec<br/>&gt;&gt; ond tone. In the triad it is the third tone, and in the<br/>&gt;&gt; chromatic scale it comes in seventh place. That we name<br/>&gt;&gt; the interval c - g, five, does not mean that c - g is<br/>&gt;&gt; actually, in every context, five; our usage comes<br/>&gt;&gt; from the fact that in our present scale - *our* scale<br/>&gt;&gt; -  exactly three tones come between c and g. But what<br/>&gt;&gt; if there had been four or two? And there could have<br/>&gt;&gt; been, and it would have been right, too; for nature<br/>&gt;&gt; lends herself to a far greater variety of interpretations<br/>&gt;&gt; than [do] our secrets.<br/>&gt;&gt; Such errors result whenever one merely searches out<br/>&gt;&gt; reasons enough to explain what is known, instead of<br/>&gt;&gt; providing a surplus of reasons to embrace cases that<br/>&gt;&gt; do not yet exist. Such errors result whenever one takes<br/>&gt;&gt; the known phenomena to be the only ones there are, to<br/>&gt;&gt; be the ultimate and immutable manifestations of nature,<br/>&gt;&gt; and explains only these, instead of contemplating nature<br/>&gt;&gt; comprehensively in its relation to our feelings and<br/>&gt;&gt; perceptions. If the latter viewpoint is taken, these<br/>&gt;&gt; phenomena will reveal that they are not conclusive,<br/>&gt;&gt; not final, not definitive; rather that they are a small<br/>&gt;&gt; part of an immense, incalculable whole, in which the<br/>&gt;&gt; number five is just as interesting as, but no more<br/>&gt;&gt; mysterious than, all other numbers, be they prime numbers,<br/>&gt;&gt; products, or powers.</p><p>That is hardly a polemic from someone who feels that the<br/>5-limit 4:5:6 triad is &quot;the one true chord of nature&quot;.</p><p>So &apos;Schoenberg&apos;s words about &quot;the prototype&quot; &apos; never refer<br/>only to a 4:5:6 chord, but always include higher overtones;<br/>he himself specified 11-limit in this book.  See below.</p><p>&gt;  Joe Monzo further reveals his ignorance when he claims:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;Schoenberg thought of the higher overtones as a paradigm for<br/>&gt; the chromatic pitches of the 12-tET scale, and as they fit<br/>&gt; into a harmonious structure in the single tone, he saw no<br/>&gt; reason why they could not fit into chords in the same way.<br/>&gt; But he still referred to them as &quot;dissonances&quot;, which is how<br/>&gt; the term had been and was still being used by most *other*<br/>&gt; theorists and composers.  This is why Thomson missed the<br/>&gt; boat on this subject, and apparently you too are still on<br/>&gt; the dock with *him*.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Joe Monzo&apos;s statement is ignorant because it is<br/>&gt; meaningless to speak an overtone by itself as &quot;consonant&quot;<br/>&gt; or dissonant.&quot;<br/>&gt;    Schoenberg tried to claim that the 12-equal system<br/>&gt; was an approximation of a 19-limit system,</p><p>Wrong, wrong, wrong.  See below.</p><p>I sure hope you enjoy the crow you must now eat after<br/>saying &quot;Joe Monzo further reveals his ignorance&quot;.  If<br/>anyone here is revealing his ignorance, it&apos;s *you*, and<br/>it gets continually worse over the next few paragraphs.</p><p>And since you just love to see ignorance refuted by<br/>evidence, keep reading... and start fasting from your<br/>regular diet, to leave room in your stomach, because<br/>there&apos;s lots more crow coming to your plate.</p><p>&gt; and indeed the approximation of a 19-limit JI tuning<br/>&gt;     1/1   17/16   9/8   19/16  24/19  4/3   24/17  3/2<br/>&gt; 38/19  19/12  16/9  32/17 [2/1]<br/>&gt;     to 12-equal is better overall than the 5-limit<br/>&gt; diatonic syntonon.</p><p>What you say here is true, but the latter tuning has no<br/>real bearing on Schoenberg&apos;s 1911 theory of rational<br/>harmonic implications, and the former has absolutely<br/>nothing at all to do with it.  See below.</p><p>&gt;     But Schoenberg made the foolish and ignorant error<br/>&gt; of claiming that &quot;a higher overtone&quot; *by itself* is<br/>&gt; &quot;consonant&quot; or &quot;dissonant.&quot;</p><p>Citation, please.</p><p>&gt; That is foolish and shows<br/>&gt; us clearly Schoenberg&apos;s appalling ignorance of mathematics<br/>&gt; as well as his shocking incompetence at music theory.<br/>&gt;     Because the simple fact remains that context, in music,<br/>&gt; is all. Moreover, Schoenberg never bothers to tell us whether<br/>&gt; he is talking about prime numbers, or musical intervals<br/>&gt; measured from the 1/1, or successive intervals in the<br/>&gt; overtone series, or what.</p><p>Wrong again.  In _Harmonielehre_, Schoenberg clearly lays<br/>out his entire system of rational harmonic implications.<br/>See below.</p><p>&gt; Now, notice that by taking powers<br/>&gt; and ratios of ANY given overtone, whether high or low, you<br/>&gt; can obtain ANY desired musical interval. Moreover, you<br/>&gt; M*U*S*T specify the _context_ in which an overtone<br/>&gt; occurs.<br/>&gt;     Thus, the 19/18 is a rough interval, but the<br/>&gt; 19/16 is a smooth interval.  The 17/16 is a rough<br/>&gt; interval, but the 24/17 is a smooth interval.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;Reference to Bulgarian Women&apos;s Choir snipped as<br/>&gt; having no relevance whatsoever to this discussion.&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     The question is meaningless. For the question can ONLY<br/>&gt; be answered if we known in what context the prime number<br/>&gt; 19 occurs -- is it the 19 on top in a 19/18?  Or is it the<br/>&gt; 19 on top in 19/16?<br/>&gt;     And in what context does that 19/16 occur? In what<br/>&gt; context does that 19/18 occur?</p><p>Wrong, wrong, and wrong again.</p><p>Brian, after the voluminous and caustic words you wrote in<br/>this post blasting me for my lazyness and &quot;poor scholarship&quot;,<br/>I can barely stop laughing over the unfathomable absurdity<br/>of this monstrous _faux pas_!</p><p>You have a 1998 copy of my book [Monzo 1998, _JustMusic:<br/>A New Harmony_], in which I detail the rational implications<br/>of Schoenberg&apos;s harmonic theory as described by Schoenberg<br/>himself in _Harmonielehre_ [1911], and in &quot;Problems of<br/>Harmony&quot; [1934].</p><p>Since you&apos;re responding to *me* regarding Schoenberg, one<br/>would think that you&apos;d take the trouble *reach over to<br/>YOUR OWN BOOKSHELF* to read what *I&apos;ve* published about him.</p><p>Had you done that, or for that matter if you had really<br/>studied Schoenberg&apos;s own book (of which everyone here knows<br/>you have access to a copy of the 1978 Roy Carter English<br/>translation, since you&apos;ve cited it here numerous times), you<br/>would know that your description of his harmonic system as<br/>given above is totally erroneous.  And it&apos;s interesting to<br/>me that you presented it without a citation.  If Schoenberg<br/>did indeed write this (about 17- and 19-limit ratios) and<br/>I haven&apos;t seen it, then by all means please correct me.</p><p>AFAIK (which on this topic is quite a considerable amount),<br/>Schoenberg never wrote a single word about any 17- or<br/>19-limit ratio, or any other prime-limit higher than 13.<br/>And 13 was only included in his system of rational implications<br/>in &quot;Problems of Harmony&quot; [Schoenberg 1984, _Style and Idea_,<br/>p 268], written as a lecture in 1927 and revised and first<br/>published in 1934.</p><p>My entire focus here has been on Schoneberg&apos;s harmonic<br/>theory around the time he wrote his first &quot;atonal&quot;<br/>compositions and his _Harmonielehre_, c. 1907-10.<br/>In _Harmonielehre_, he elaborates an 11-limit system<br/>of pitches derived from the 2nd thru 11th partials of<br/>the Tonic note, the 2nd thru 12th partials of the<br/>Subdominant and Dominant notes, and also including the<br/>16th partial of the Subdominant.  I would describe this in<br/>a simplified mathematical form as (2...12,16) / 3^(-1...1) .</p><p>Here&apos;s a quote from a post I sent to the tuning-math list,<br/>which provides a detailed *ACCURATE* assessment of<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s 1911 theory of the rational implications<br/>of the 12-tET chromatic scale as he used it in his<br/>compositions of the period.</p><p>(In fact, Brian, you might find this to be an intriguing<br/>tuning to try in your own compositions.)</p><p>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/44">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning-math/message/44</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; From:  &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt;<br/>&gt; Date:  Sun May 27, 2001  5:55 pm<br/>&gt; Subject:  Re: Fwd: optimizing octaves in MIRACLE scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; (My quotes of Schoenberg are from the English translation<br/>&gt; of _Harmonielehre_ by Roy Carter, and the page numbers<br/>&gt; refer to that edition.)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schoenberg [p 23] posits the existences of two &quot;forces&quot;, one<br/>&gt; pulling downward and one pulling upward around the tonic,<br/>&gt; which he illustrates as: F &lt;- C -&gt; G and likens to resistance<br/>&gt; against gravity.  In mathematical terms, he is referring to<br/>&gt; the harmonic relationships of 3^-1 and 3^1, respectively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; [Schoenberg, p 24:]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; ...thus it is explained how the scale that finally emerged<br/>&gt;&gt; is put together from the most important components of a<br/>&gt;&gt; fundamental tone and its nearest relatives.  These nearest<br/>&gt;&gt; relatives are just what gives the fundamental tone stability;<br/>&gt;&gt; for it represents the point of balance between their opposing<br/>&gt;&gt; tendencies.  This scale appears as the residue of the properties<br/>&gt;&gt; of the three factors, as a vertical projection, as addition:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Schoenberg then presents a diagram of the overtones and the<br/>&gt; resulting scale, which I have adaptated, adding the partial-numbers<br/>&gt; which relate all the overtones together as a single set:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;              b-45<br/>&gt;              g-36<br/>&gt;        e-30<br/>&gt;              d-27<br/>&gt;        c-24<br/>&gt;  a-20<br/>&gt;        g-18  g-18<br/>&gt;  f-16<br/>&gt;  c-12  c-12<br/>&gt;  f-8<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;  f   c   g   a   d   e   b<br/>&gt;  8  12  18  20  27  30  45<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; [Schoenberg:]<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Adding up the overtones (omitting repetitions) we get the seven<br/>&gt;&gt; tones of our scale.  Here they are not yet arranged consecutively.<br/>&gt;&gt; But even the scalar order can be obtained if we assume that the<br/>&gt;&gt; further overtones are also in effect.  And that assumption is<br/>&gt;&gt; in fact not optional; we must assume the presence of the other<br/>&gt;&gt; overtones.  The ear could also have defined the relative pitch<br/>&gt;&gt; of the tones discovered by comparing them with taut strings,<br/>&gt;&gt; which of course become longer or shorter as the tone is lowered<br/>&gt;&gt; or raised.  But the more distant overtones were also a<br/>&gt;&gt; dependable guide.

He was thinking of high-limit ratios<br/>&gt; as *overtones*, not as ratios _per se_, which is how you present your<br/>&gt; argument here.&quot; [Monzo, Joe, op cit.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     How does Joe Monzo know what Schoenberg was thinking?<br/>&gt;     Does Joe Monzo have a degree from the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&apos;s<br/>&gt; College of Telepathy?</p><p>No.  This answer is obvious: I&apos;ve studied everything about the<br/>man&apos;s work that I&apos;ve had the time to read, listened to other<br/>people&apos;s recordings of *and* made my own MIDI-files of many<br/>of his compositions, and drawn a lot of my own new conclusions<br/>from a consideration of the cultural and musical milieu in which<br/>Schoenberg was immersed.  Please see, for an example of this<br/>latter, my webpage &quot;A Century of New Music in Vienna&quot;:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm</a>&gt;.</p><p>&gt;    Schoenberg seems to be speaking of the prime numbers<br/>&gt; themselves.<br/>&gt;     But, as I have already pointed out above, it is musically<br/>&gt; meaningless to speak of the &quot;consonance&quot; or &quot;dissonance&quot;<br/>&gt; or indeed of the sound of a *prime number*.<br/>&gt;     Prime numbers are quite meaningless except when embodied in<br/>&gt; RATIOS.  You cannot hear the prime number 19 -- you can only hear a<br/>&gt; RATIO such as 19:1, 19/16, 19/18, etc.</p><p>Again, unless I somehow missed it, 19-limit ratios have absolutely<br/>nothing at all to do with Schoenberg&apos;s harmonic theory, rendering<br/>all of this entirely superflous and beside the point in a<br/>debate about Schoenberg&apos;s harmonic theory.</p><p>(Some crow for desert too, eh?)</p><p>&gt;     By mixing up the realm of abstract mathematics (in which<br/>&gt; overtones exist) with the realm of actual musical intervals<br/>&gt; (in which ratios exist), Joe Monzo follows his cult guru<br/>&gt; into the tarpit of confusion.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Joe Monzo claims that &quot;the &grave;dissonances&apos; were always<br/>&gt; being measured from 1/1 and its &grave;octaves.&apos;&quot; [Monzo, Joe,<br/>&gt; op cit.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     If that were true, then Schoenberg&apos;s claims are obviously<br/>&gt; and clearly foolish and false, since the octave of 1/1 closest<br/>&gt; to 19 is 16 and therefore the 19th overtone should be 19/16,<br/>&gt; a thoroughly smooth minor third -- yet Schoenberg claims that the<br/>&gt; higher overtones are &quot;dissonances,&quot; which cannot be the case if Joe<br/>&gt; Monzo is correct.<br/>&gt;     Accordingly Joe Monzo&apos;s claim cannot be true.  Schoenberg must<br/>&gt; have been talking about the abstract numbers themselves, or possibly<br/>&gt; about the intervals twixt successive overtones,  not about the ratio<br/>&gt; of the overtone with the closest octave of 1/1.<br/>&gt;    If Schoenberg spoke about the intervals twixt successive<br/>&gt; overtones, then our ears tell us that the 7/6 and subsequent<br/>&gt; nearby intervals sound rough because they all fall within the<br/>&gt; critical band.<br/>&gt;    But this is a problem, for Schoenberg elsewhere discusses<br/>&gt; 12-equal as a 19-limit system, and if we are speaking of<br/>&gt; successive intervals in the overtone series, we cannot get<br/>&gt; the 24/19 and 24/17 and 19/16 Schoenberg uses to approximate &gt; 12-equal.<br/>&gt;     Bottom line?<br/>&gt;     Schoenberg&apos;s &quot;theoretical&quot; discussion of overtones<br/>&gt; is a complete mess. Even a not-very-bright undergraduate in<br/>&gt; one of today&apos;s Top 10 Party colleges could do better, with<br/>&gt; less self-contradiction, fewer incoherent undefined terms,<br/>&gt; and fewer foolish musical old wive&apos;s tales fobbed off as<br/>&gt; unquestioned axioms of the musical universe.</p><p>Again, where is this &quot;elsewhere&quot; where Schoenberg &quot;discusses<br/>12-equal as a 19-limit system&quot;?  Unless you can produce it,<br/>your description is wrong, wrong, and wrong, in addition<br/>to being itself &quot;a complete mess&quot;.</p><p>(Crow for a midnight snack too, huh?)</p><p>&gt;    Joe Monzo then engages in further garbled reasoning and<br/>&gt; scrambled logic when he claims:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    &quot;So it&apos;s quite pointless to invoke ratios like 8192/6561 or<br/>&gt; 19683/16384 here.  Sure, they occur in Pythagorean tuning, but what<br/>&gt; does that have to do with Schoenberg or the audible<br/>&gt; overtone series?  Not a thing.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     What these ratios have to do with the audible overtone<br/>&gt; series, obviously, is that we don&apos;t know whether Schoenberg<br/>&gt; was talking about successive ratios of the harmonic series,<br/>&gt; or powers of abstract prime numbers, or what.<br/>&gt;    Scohenberg was so incoherent and his writing is so unclear on the<br/>&gt; subject that we must take account of the fact that we can equally<br/>&gt; well deal with powers of those &quot;higher<br/>&gt; overtones&quot; as the primes numbers themselves. And since<br/>&gt; Schoenberg never bothers to make clear exactly what he means (a<br/>&gt; chronic problem -- G. B. Shaw once wittily remarked that &quot;The English<br/>&gt; language occasionally descends into incoherence, just as the German<br/>&gt; language occasionally emerges from it&quot;) we must take account of all<br/>&gt; possibilities.</p><p>That&apos;s simply a cop-out from someone who doesn&apos;t want to<br/>grapple with Schoenberg&apos;s difficult prose style and complex<br/>logic.</p><p>&gt;    Joe Monzo then goes on to mix apples and oranges when<br/>&gt; he claims:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    &quot;...Schoenberg&apos;s compositional practice refutes what<br/>&gt; you say here.  He was well aware that dissonance<br/>&gt; is a function of musical context, and *his* style after 1907<br/>&gt; recognized these &grave;more remote relationships&apos; as consonances while the<br/>&gt; rest of the *theoretical* world continued to view them as<br/>&gt; dissonances.&quot; [Monzo, Joe, op cit.]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Notice that Joe Monzo, finding himself in trouble<br/>&gt; when going by Schoenberg&apos;s text, suddenly jumps to<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s compositional practice.<br/>&gt;    If Schoenberg writes about music, we must stick to what<br/>&gt; he wrote, and not go gallivanting off claiming &quot;Oh, well, he<br/>&gt; wrote music later that makes everything okay.&quot;<br/>&gt;    That the classic fallacy of the non sequitur argument.<br/>&gt;    &quot;UFOs must be abducting people, because if they don&apos;t,<br/>&gt; what happened to my brother Clem who&apos;s still missing?&quot;</p><p>There&apos;s no non sequitur here at all.

Despite my clear presentation<br/>&gt; of the gist of Schoenberg&apos;s beliefs and ideas c. 1910, for<br/>&gt; primarily your benefit, you continue to present a summary<br/>&gt; of Schoenberg&apos;s work which is filled with errors and<br/>&gt; misinterpretations.  So I will no longer bother to chase<br/>&gt; down all the citations which correct your mistakes, because<br/>&gt; you don&apos;t take the time to understand them fully, instead<br/>&gt; simply tearing thru your own library finding more citations<br/>&gt; which support your conclusions, which are still erroneous<br/>&gt; as applied to Schoenberg.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
