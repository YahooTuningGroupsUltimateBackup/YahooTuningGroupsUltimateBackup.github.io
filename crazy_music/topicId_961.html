All credit must be due to the incredible<br/>&gt; performers though!</p><p>Indeed!</p><p>&gt; This *is actually* a 1 minute long recording of the sound of this<br/>&gt; sound mass coming from the crickets around my apartment! This *is*<br/>&gt; really what it sounds like (except I&apos;m playing in the scale found in<br/>&gt; the FFT)! It is very loud and just surrounds everything - it is quite<br/>&gt; amazing.</p><p>I&apos;m totally amazed!</p><p>&gt; Now, please note that I did not play the sample any higher than the<br/>&gt; actual pitch of the original, so when you hear that highest sound in<br/>&gt; the MP3, you are hearing it at pitch. All else is me playing the<br/>&gt; sample at the different intervals found in the FFT analysis, and<br/>&gt; below the original pitch.</p><p>I wondered what kind of wizardry you used to get such a sample<br/>together so quickly, with all those various sounds!</p><p>&gt; It is a mesmerizingly beautiful sound! When you hear it please let me<br/>&gt; know what you think about the original and try to imagine this sound<br/>&gt; filling the air each night here with this magnificent Orchestra of<br/>&gt; the Crickets!</p><p>Thanks so much.</p><p>Sounds wonderful.</p><p>I can still hear the train (the sound of the rails gently humming as<br/>train drives over them). Some of the other sounds like the<br/>cymbal, marimba, conga and sub harmonic singing must depend<br/>on the pitch you play it at.</p><p>I&apos;ve put it into a loop, and the more you listen the more you hear.</p><p>&gt; BTW - I wish you all could hear the Cicadas! As above they come into<br/>&gt; full cycle every 13 to 17 years. Once when I was a child, I remember<br/>&gt; them being so loud and just filling the air, that you literally would<br/>&gt; have to talk at the top of your lungs to carry on a conversation<br/>&gt; outside. If I can ever get a good recording of this I&apos;ll certainly<br/>&gt; share it here (or the Katydid!).<br/>!!!</p><p>Well, maybe I&apos;ll try going to sleep to loop of the cicadas mp3,<br/>as you all are in the States.</p><p>Notice 13 and 17 are primes. I seem to remember reading about<br/>a biological reason for this, something about primes meaning<br/>it is harder for predators to get in sync, or something. Also<br/>happens with some plants / trees such as bamboo I believe.</p><p>Anyone know any more about that?</p><p>Robert</p></div>
