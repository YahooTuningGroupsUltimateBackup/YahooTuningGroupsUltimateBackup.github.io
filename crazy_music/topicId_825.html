You, too, are welcome to pick a piece.<br/>&gt; The one I remember posting long ago was Beethoven&apos;s Pathetique Sonata,<br/>&gt; quite vivid but in truth a rather poor sequence (much over-quantized).</p><p>I&apos;m interested to hear this!</p><p>Just now listening to the gritty and dramatic recording of it in<br/>Prinz temperament on Ed Foote&apos;s Beethoven cd.</p><p>Could also be interesting to hear the movement 2 of the cpe bach<br/>that I&apos;m practicing. I enjoy the gentle pitch fluctuations<br/>of the melody line, but could be interesting to hear what<br/>it is like with more abrupt ones, and even purer harmonies,<br/>if I understand right what the early version does.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
