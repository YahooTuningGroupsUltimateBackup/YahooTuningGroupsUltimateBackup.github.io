Here is a piece that uses a tuning I find to be<br/>melodically interesting.</p><p>It&apos;s called &quot;A Breeze Stirs the Shade&quot; and is meant to<br/>evoke the image of sitting in the shade in the desert<br/>during the heat of the day as a breeze brushes past.</p><p>The ancient harp it is played on has more strings and a<br/>greater range than would be found on authentic<br/>instruments, but I find this tuning is what I was<br/>looking for to convey the right mood of those times.</p><p><a href="http://geocities.com/nonoctave/">http://geocities.com/nonoctave/</a></p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
