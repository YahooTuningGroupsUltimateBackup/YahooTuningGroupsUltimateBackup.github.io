Instead, you fired off a<br/>form letter with my name in all the critical places (I will<br/>point out that by some standards, such a dodge would amount<br/>to proof that you were completely smashed by my post and<br/>utterly without a cogent reply).  Your form letter is good<br/>enough for this response, but no more, unless you actually<br/>want to discuss music.</p><p>&gt;    Carl Lumma has never produced even one (1) piece<br/>&gt; of microtonal music so far as I have heard.</p><p>So far as you have heard.</p><p>&gt;    After 7 long years, Carl Lumma has not produced even a<br/>&gt; single finished piece of microtonal music so far as anyone<br/>&gt; can tell.</p><p>So far as anyone can tell.</p><p>Seems to be getting stronger as you go.  Exactly what level<br/>of understanding of my musical activity do you have, Brian?</p><p>&gt;    Of course Carl Lumma will deny this, and when he does he&apos;ll<br/>&gt; be lying.</p><p>Really?</p><p>&gt; The proof is simple and straightforward: if Carl Lumma has<br/>&gt; produced so many microtonal compositions, where are they?</p><p>That&apos;s not a very compelling proof, Brian.</p><p>&gt; Carl thinks he can get some street cred by typing about<br/>&gt; all the tunings he&apos;s never even heard.</p><p>Is that what I think?  And how do you know I don&apos;t tune up<br/>every scale I write about?  Do you actually have any data<br/>on this matter whatsoever?</p><p>Since you have declared me a liar, you may not believe that<br/>I tune up about 75% of the scales I&apos;ve written about, and<br/>100% of the scales I&apos;ve written about in any detail.</p><p>&gt;    These three jerkoffs tyrannized the Alternative Wanking List<br/>&gt; for 7 long years with upwards of 10 posts per day (Carl Lumma,<br/>&gt; Dave Keenan, Paul Erlich)</p><p>I averaged maybe 1 post per day for 3 years, and about 2 posts<br/>per month for the last 6 months, on all lists.  Now, Brian, you<br/>may take that data and say anything about it you&apos;d like.</p><p>As far as wasting time writing about microtonality, it is a<br/>documented fact that you have spent far more ink on the subject<br/>than I.  It is my opinion (as opposed to a documented fact)<br/>that my output is far more useful than yours.  Assuming you<br/>disagree, if you have even read my stuff, should this difference<br/>of opinion mean we must be enemies, attacking each other like<br/>diseased carrion-eating mammals?</p><p>&gt; Eventually, I will get tired of dealing with people like Lumma.<br/>&gt; Eventually I will tire of the endless sewage-spill of lies and<br/>&gt; verbal attacks hurled at me merely because I cite documented<br/>&gt; facts about microtonality...</p><p>Is that what the message I am quoting contained, Brian?<br/>Documented facts about microtonality?  Tell me what you think,<br/>honestly.</p><p>&gt;    Incidentally, Carl, has it occurred to you that Erv Wilson<br/>&gt; is the worst possible person you could pick for a cult guru?<br/>&gt; Erv knows a lot and he&apos;s a great guy...but he doesn&apos;t<br/>&gt; produce microtonal music. Just as you don&apos;t produce actual<br/>&gt; microtonal music, Carl.</p><p>Who says Erv is my guru?  Who says I care to produce any<br/>microtonal music?  What the hell are you talking about?</p><p>&gt;You haven&apos;t put in *any* of that work, Carl, and as a result<br/>&gt;you can&apos;t get away with not composing any microtonal music.</p><p>I gather that you consider it impossible that I am sitting on<br/>a body of unpublished microtonal music (whatever that is) as<br/>I write this.  Why this is the case, I have no idea.  Norman<br/>Henry has a body of microtonal scores and corresponding<br/>recordings that would embarrass the both of us, yet he will<br/>not release them.  Can you fathom why?</p><p>Since you are in error about even my published work, I will<br/>summarize it for you here:</p><p>() 3 years of regular public performance in brass choir.</p><p>() 3 years of regular public performance in a cappella<br/>vocal groups.</p><p>() 9 megabytes of 128Kbps mp3 (9-limit piano music) published<br/>on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>.</p><p>() ~12 megabytes of mp3 (various tuning demos) published to<br/><a href="http://lumma.org">lumma.org</a>.</p><p>() 6 minutes of 15-limit slide guitar published on CD (with<br/>65 minutes of 12-tET music).  I built the slide guitar from<br/>scratch and tune it by ear.</p><p>() 3.5 minutes of 9-limit brass quartet performed at NYU.</p><p>() over 6 hours of 17-limit music recorded featuring me on<br/>9-limit Baldwin organ, over 804 megabytes of wav data of it<br/>published to CD.</p><p>() 6 megabytes of 128Kbps mp3 published to <a href="http://lumma.org">lumma.org</a><br/>(computer performance of MIDI scores).</p><p>() 1 short MIDI sequence in 8-tET recorded by you, on your own<br/>equipment.  Still have it?</p><p>None of this has anything to do with the issues I raised in my<br/>last post.  The whole &quot;but he doesn&apos;t have any CDs&quot; thing, even<br/>when true, is nothing but poisoning the well.  And please don&apos;t<br/>confuse me with any of the poor suckers that are actually<br/>offended by your ad hominem nonsense; this will spare you many<br/>keystrokes in the paranoid martyr section of your posts.</p><p>Really, Brian, I expected much better from you.  I have a<br/>significant degree of respect for your work as both a music<br/>publisher and creator.  I have never been shy to invest in your<br/>efforts (I would guess that I outspent all other patrons at<br/>your booth in LA), and I have spoken on your behalf on numerous<br/>occasions.  It would sadden me if our professional relationship<br/>were damaged by this nonsense.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
