In that sense, nobody<br/>can play the resultant, which is the closest one could get to a melody<br/>line, and therefore it is simply not possible to think of the melody as<br/>somehow &apos;resulting&apos; from one person playing &apos;an instrument&apos; in the same way<br/>that someone could play the melody of Jesu Joy of Man&apos;s Desiring, say, on<br/>their guitar.<br/>&quot;</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PostTonality/message/946">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PostTonality/message/946</a></p><p>Robert</p></div>
