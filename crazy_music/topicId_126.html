I suppose that is what I had in mind about kind of warning<br/>&gt; about it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; Yes. Ahem. I am not the world&apos;s most attentive driver.  My husband<br/>&gt; refuses to be in a car when I am driving for that is worth :-), but<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve never had an accident.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s the main thing.</p><p>I&apos;m not a driver myself, but decidedly absent minded. I&apos;m okay at bicycle<br/>pace, but not tested at faster speeds!</p><p>&gt; &gt; I suppose when one listens to music intently, say, something like a<br/>&gt; &gt; string quartet, one gets so absorbed in the music, one is less aware<br/>&gt; &gt; of everything else - I don&apos;t know if that is related to the trance<br/>&gt; &gt; idea. Do you know the Hoffnung short cartoon about a string quartet<br/>&gt; &gt; playing away while their stage is dismantled and placed on a lorry,<br/>&gt; &gt; and so forth, not aware of anything around them, so absorbed in the<br/>&gt; &gt; music?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; That certainly happens to me to some extent, and I think it is prob.<br/>&gt; &gt; fairly common. One is still aware of the music, but one kind of<br/>&gt; feels<br/>&gt; &gt; it as much as one hears it. I expect many musicians who think they<br/>&gt; &gt; never go into a trance can relate to that experience, but I don&apos;t<br/>&gt; know<br/>&gt; &gt; if it is the same thing. I think it is the same thing, and I think<br/>&gt; the capacity to become totally absorbed, or completely focused, is a<br/>&gt; trance.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I expect the matter of dissonances waking one up may be largely<br/>&gt; &gt; a matter of familiarity. 17-tet dissonances would be particularly<br/>&gt; &gt; unfamiliar, and a new dissonance would wake one up. Also of course<br/>&gt; &gt; it is a lively temperament and not likely to be part. conducive<br/>&gt; &gt; to trance, and that it is at all perhaps shows there is another<br/>&gt; &gt; side to 17-tet.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; , just as sleep and dreaming are healing things too.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Exactly.  the most healing states are not full beta consciousness.<br/>&gt; For myself, if I can&apos;t spend some time each day daydreaming, or what<br/>&gt; I call exploring other realms and dimensions, I get very cranky and<br/>&gt; don&apos;t feel terribly creative. Again getting fully absorbed in<br/>&gt; something also works for me in the same way.  My suspicion is there<br/>&gt; is a chemistry generated in these states that is beneficial for the<br/>&gt; body.</p><p>I found this very helpful, thanks. I&apos;m sure there is something to be<br/>said for setting time aside for daydreaming if one finds oneself<br/>overworking. Just a pause to listen to some beautiful music<br/>can do that. Or a walk out of doors too in beautiful countryside,<br/>if one is that way inclined, anything inspiring and not quite hum drum.</p><p>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; However, truth is, I prefer my listeners to hear my music rather<br/>&gt; &gt; than to go into a trance and miss it all, but may be not quite<br/>&gt; &gt; getting what a trance is all about when I say that.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For myself I tend to hear everything much more clearly in an altered<br/>&gt; state of consciousness - almost like I can stretch time and have<br/>&gt; enough space to hear every little nuance.  I don&apos;t however remember,<br/>&gt; or choose to remember, every detail when I&apos;m back in full waking<br/>&gt; consciousness, in part I think because the feeling is most precious<br/>&gt; to me.  Actually as I read over these words I realize my own personal<br/>&gt; goal with music is to be able to express more and more of the beauty<br/>&gt; and sacredness I can feel in these states, using my voice in<br/>&gt; particular.</p><p>That makes sense, thanks! I&apos;ve tried listening to one of your<br/>pieces taking this especially in mind and it is a nice way to do it.<br/>I can understand how one might be so immersed in the music that though<br/>one is very aware of it at the time, one doesn&apos;t necessarily remember much about<br/>it later.</p><p>I think that sometimes happens when I listen to some<br/>music, such as maybe a string quartet in some situations.<br/>Can be quite spaced out afterwards, and it isn&apos;t so easy<br/>to talk immediately because one has been in a realm where music takes<br/>the place of speech, and one wants to join in making music<br/>rather than speak, something like that. I can relate that to<br/>journeying to other realms - like one has been in a string quartet<br/>realm, and it takes a moment or two to get back to the<br/>ordinary realm we are in normally (or think we are in<br/>anyway).</p><p>Maybe I do trance then, but never called it that.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; Its fun talking about this stuff with you Robert.</p><p>Thanks, I&apos;m enjoying talking about it too.</p><p>New beta preview has Glock.

I was driving a lama (Sakya)<br/>to catch a train through midday traffic in washington DC. We were<br/>late, traffic was heavy and I was driving a bit recklessly trying to<br/>make up time.  Thelama murmered something to me about slowing down<br/>and I said &quot;oh don&apos;t worry.

I remember it often  :-))</p></div>
