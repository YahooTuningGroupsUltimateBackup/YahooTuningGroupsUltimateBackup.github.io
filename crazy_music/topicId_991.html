Hope to do new beta<br/>&gt;proper soon, and then release soon after that, once help is ready.</p><p>Can I be on your mailing list?</p><p>&gt;Suppose in main channel c is 1/1 of your j.i. scale. (where 1/1 is<br/>&gt;arbitrarily set to some absolute pitch, say, concert pitch C). Then<br/>&gt;E is the 5/4 above this.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;That has to correspond to some root in the root channel, and suppose<br/>&gt;for definiteness that your c = 1/1 as default when no key has yet<br/>&gt;been pressed, and the same when key C is pressed.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Now when you change the root to, say, F in the root channel, i.e.<br/>&gt;the F of the mean-tone scale, or whatever, question is, what happens<br/>&gt;to the E. Is it still 5/4 above something?</p><p>Not in my scheme.  That would seem to require large pitch shifts<br/>for keys on the main keyboard (?).  In my scheme, choosing F simply<br/>indicates the pitch at which the sequence of intervals starting at<br/>1/1 is centered.  The pitch can come from the control keyboard,<br/>in which case the total accessible tuning is limited to the cross<br/>set of the two scales, or it can come from the main keyboard, in<br/>which case the total accessible tuning is infinite.  All this<br/>will be made clear in the spec, which is half-finished as of 2am<br/>last night.  BTW, I do not mean to enforce my ideas with the spec...<br/>it&apos;s just that I need to make my ideas more clear, for myself, and<br/>if I intend to share them efficiently with others.</p><p>&gt;If one did it same way as the tonaility diamond, just multiplying<br/>&gt;the value in the root channel by value in the main channel,<br/>&gt;then you&apos;ll get it E -&gt; 5/4 * (value for F), and so 5/4 above the F.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I.e. when you press the F for the root, then the just intonation<br/>&gt;12 tone scale from c to c&apos; is still the ji. 12-tone, but this<br/>&gt;time the c playes an f, because you have shifted everything up by<br/>&gt;the interval c - f in the root channel.</p><p>No, we don&apos;t want that... large pitch shifts of the main keyboard<br/>would make it very hard to play, and nothing more than a glorified<br/>version of a &quot;transposing keyboard&quot;... an idea hundreds of years<br/>old... though I&apos;m told Irving Berlin could only play in F#, and had<br/>a transposing keyboard to get around this!</p><p>&gt;However, more natural idea might be to make it the 8/9 (or whatever)<br/>&gt;below the F of the root channel, so that it still sounds as a note<br/>&gt;somewhere in the vicinity of concert pitch E.</p><p>Correct -- that&apos;s my idea.  It&apos;s still just multiplication, except<br/>you&apos;re making sure to keep 1/1 on the same physical key on the<br/>main keyboard (there&apos;s a 1/1 in every scale in the tonality diamond,<br/>remember).  The possible pitches of every other physical key are<br/>then found on the diagonals of the diamond.</p><p>&gt;However, with tonality diamond, with no note names to want to<br/>&gt;preserve, I think one would find it easier to navigate if the two<br/>&gt;keyboards were just the two axes of the diamond, and the note<br/>&gt;played was the product of the two.</p><p>Well, I&apos;ll disagree, but that doesn&apos;t mean I wouldn&apos;t like to<br/>try this method!</p><p>&gt;Obviously use most of the same code for both, but would need a<br/>&gt;couple of extra lines (maybe more) for one of them.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Is that any clearer yet?</p><p>Yes -- hopefully for you too.  Thanks, Robert, for this highly<br/>productive discussion.</p><p>&gt;&gt;But most importantly, such a package would support custom staff<br/>&gt;&gt;design... so you could map, for example, something like Paul<br/>&gt;&gt;Erlich&apos;s decatonic scale to successive staff positions, and use<br/>&gt;&gt;it like a diatonic scale!  No score entry software I know of even<br/>&gt;&gt;claims to support this behavior.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Ah, this last you can do with midi relaying, to reasonable first<br/>&gt;approx. I use it all the time, using NoteworthyComposer (which<br/>&gt;happens to be the score editor I use), but it will work with any.</p><p>Why didn&apos;t I think of that?</p><p>I knew you used NWC, which I haven&apos;t tried in years, but I didn&apos;t<br/>know you used this technique!</p><p>&gt;Just add a note to the score saying what mapping you use, which<br/>&gt;can be any mapping of midi notes of the stave to pitches that<br/>&gt;you like. That&apos;s for oneself, so that you will know what mapping<br/>&gt;to use in future, by reading the score.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Then relay it with that mapping. I use Hubi&apos;s loopback, a free<br/>&gt;software driver that relays midi out of one prog. to midi in of<br/>&gt;another. I think there is another driver that does the same thing.</p><p>Midi Yolk, which I use all the time.</p><p>&gt;If you look at the scores for most of the pieces on my tunes page,<br/>&gt;then you&apos;ll see that they are done this way.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://robertinventor.tripod.com/tunes/tunes.htm">http://robertinventor.tripod.com/tunes/tunes.htm</a></p><p>When I get into work, I&apos;ll grab everything off your page.</p><p>&gt;So I can play them any time just by setting up the mapping<br/>&gt;in FTS and playing them in NWC. In fact one could also save them<br/>&gt;as 12-tet midi files and relay them with the mapping from those<br/>&gt;too.</p><p>Right.</p><p>I&apos;ve always used Breed&apos;s Midi Relay, but it has a key repeat<br/>bug, where notes revert to 12-tET.  How does FTS do?</p><p>&gt;I&apos;m surprised how few seem to use this technique. Mats Oljare does,<br/>&gt;using Graham Breed&apos;s program for midi relaying in his case.</p><p>I thought he used Cakewalk piano roll view... is he a NWC convert?</p><p>&gt;I often do it so that repeats of the scale are shown as octaves in<br/>&gt;the score, so if it is say, 6 notes pad the scale out with one<br/>&gt;extra note to make it a 7 note scale, and relay it from successive<br/>&gt;white notes.<br/>/.../<br/>&gt; If non octave scale, may do it so that the non octave repeat is<br/>&gt;shown as &quot;octaves&quot; on the score.</p><p>Not sure what you mean here... why is octave repeating important?</p><p>&gt;It is only a first approx because a proper microtonal score editor<br/>&gt;would let one vary the number of lines in the stave and things like<br/>&gt;that, and use microtonal accidentals and so forth.</p><p>Right.  Well, Sibelius I believe does allow custom staves to some<br/>extent.  Microtonal accidentals are really important to the scheme...<br/>we need to look into the custom accidental features of Sibelius and<br/>Finale...</p><p>&gt;&gt; Yep.  Are you familiar with the notion of the generalzed keyboard?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;No, didn&apos;t realise it was a specific concept. Can you say more,<br/>&gt;or give ref?</p><p>Well, it just so happens I have a document for that purpose.<br/>Some of the links may have changed at the Wilson site, since<br/>Kraig went over to pdfs.  See also &quot;Janko keyboard&quot;, and the<br/>patents listed at <a href="http://www.daskin.com">www.daskin.com</a>.  Take some time to look<br/>into this one... I think you&apos;ll be interested.  To summarize:</p><p>() Conventional keyboard is better for 12-tET than many<br/>theorists give credit, but is not optimal.  Something like<br/>Vandervoort&apos;s (<a href="http://daskin.com">daskin.com</a>) Janko arrangement is superior.</p><p>() For alternate tunings, conventional (aka halberstadt)<br/>keyboard is next to useless.</p><p>() Tuning and optimum digital layout are relatively<br/>independent.  Thus, design the optimum digitals, and map<br/>any tuning you like (hence, &quot;generalized&quot;).</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Some important references on the subject of microtonal keyboards:</p><p>&lt;1.&gt;<br/>_An Elementary Treatise on Musical Intervals and Temperament_<br/>R.H.M.
