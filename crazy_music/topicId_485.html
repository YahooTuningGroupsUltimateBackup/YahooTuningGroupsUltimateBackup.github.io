I want to follow up<br/>with several individuals, not to mention listen to some of the other<br/>music that&apos;s been posted, but this week is going to be harried for me,<br/>so it&apos;ll take some time.</p><p>There is one thing I want to mention about the tuning used in Chris<br/>Bailey&apos;s sonata, but not (so far) in much of anything else I&apos;ve done,<br/>including the Bernard Hermann: negative melody springs.  This is my<br/>implementation of an idea proposed by Robert Walker: instead of using<br/>normal, positive springs to pull melodic steps toward more even<br/>intervals, the melodic springs are given _negative_ coefficients, which<br/>tends to make melodic steps more _uneven_.  The effect kicks in most<br/>strongly in fast passages, and perhaps provides a welcome antidote to<br/>the confining action of the vertical springs, which target JI intervals.</p><p>When Robert proposed this idea, I didn&apos;t think it would be pleasing, but<br/>I&apos;m changing my mind pretty fast!  It was a bit of a bear to program,<br/>because the matrix tends to become unstable and blow up; I have to<br/>adjust the negative constants on the fly to prevent complete and utter<br/>chaos from breaking out.  Kind of like this list at times!</p><p>I have a feeling that a negative spring treatment of Hermann might be<br/>pretty exciting too!  When I get a chance, I&apos;ll run it thru.  Also,<br/>I&apos;ll try Chris&apos; piece with a touch of 11-limit on top of the negative<br/>springs - wheee!</p><p>Robert Walker, thank you again for this suggestion.  Where would I be<br/>without valuable ideas and feedback from people such as you?</p><p>JdL</p></div>
