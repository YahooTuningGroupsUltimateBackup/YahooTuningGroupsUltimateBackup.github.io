Jeff Scott (or<br/>&gt;someone else) should use a random number generator to pick<br/>&gt;10 different numbers between 1 and 20.  Those will be the pieces<br/>&gt;chosen at random from this list for John deLaubenfels to actually<br/>&gt;retune into adaptive 5-limit JI.</p><p>Certainly some of these will be what I would consider more appropriate<br/>for my treatment than others, but I&apos;m perfectly willing to throw _any_<br/>sequence against my methods for comment.  Sometimes when I think the<br/>results are horrible, someone else may come along and love it.  We shall<br/>see.</p><p>You do realize that I need actual _sequences_ of these pieces, yes?<br/>Have you made your selections based upon knowledge that sequence(s)<br/>exist?  If so, please tell me where I might find them.  If not, I<br/>suggest a new list (your choice) of pieces that are out there in GM.</p><p>&gt;To avoid deliberate or inadvertant problems, John deLaubenfels<br/>&gt;should send the retuned MIDI files to a third party to realize them<br/>&gt;as recordings and turn them into MP3 files.</p><p>OK by me.</p><p>&gt;John deLaubenfels can send the retuned MIDI files to me, if<br/>&gt;he likes, or to a third party if he would feel more comfortable.</p><p>I&apos;ll send them to you if you&apos;d like.  Are you going to unblock me from<br/>e-mailing you, or shall I send them through a third party?</p><p>&gt;The 10 MIDI files should be recorded twice: once using<br/>&gt;adaptive 5-limit JI, and a second time using 12 equal.</p><p>Right.</p><p>&gt;Non-identical sections (around one minute in length) from<br/>&gt;each of the 20 MIDI files (retuned and 12 equal) should be<br/>&gt;scrambled randomly in such a way that neither the person<br/>&gt;who does it nor anyone else knows which file is retuned and<br/>&gt;which is 12-equal.  I have previously described a method<br/>&gt;of writing a PASCAL program to write a DOS batch file<br/>&gt;which will do this.</p><p>I&apos;m not following this.  Why not present the entire piece?  I&apos;m willing<br/>to trust that you&apos;ll render the MIDI faithfully, and that you&apos;ll choose<br/>random names for the MP3 files.  As long as you pledge not to cast a<br/>vote yourself (since you&apos;d know which was which), that&apos;d be enough to<br/>satisfy me.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
