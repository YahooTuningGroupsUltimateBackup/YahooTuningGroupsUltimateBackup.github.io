I could<br/>have easily worded that first sentence differently<br/>(and more compassionately) and left the follow-up<br/>sentences out, and simply presented my criticism of<br/>your scholarship and the facts as Schoenberg wrote them.</p><p>And it would be great if you would also follow these<br/>precepts in any follow-ups to this discussion (or any other).</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
