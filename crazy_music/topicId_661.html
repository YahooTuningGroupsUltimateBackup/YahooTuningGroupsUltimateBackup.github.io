For example, the<br/>literal meaning of the above quote cannot be the intended one.<br/>We all use math every day, and almost all the tunings we discuss<br/>(various types of JI, ETs including 12, meantone, etc.) involve<br/>math, from Pythagoras to Wilson.  What exactly are you guys<br/>debating?</p><p>Math is just a tool, like language.  Language can commit all of<br/>the atrocities attributed to math.  For example, McLaren says<br/>that the 666 cent fifth is functional in 9-tET but not 18-tET.<br/>What does he mean?  9-tET is a subset of 18-tET, as we all know.<br/>This relates to a distinction between melodic scales and<br/>tunings of those scales.  McLaren asks about a point at which<br/>the ETs become indistinguishable.  It seems as if his question<br/>is really only about using ETs as melodic objects, as it is easy<br/>to demonstrate that chords in 72-tET sound different from chords<br/>in 71-tET.  But scales as big as even 18-tET cannot function as<br/>fundamental melodic entities, as McLaren himself one claimed<br/>(private communication), so subsetting is involved anyway.</p><p>So the term &quot;scale&quot; is sometimes used interchangably with the<br/>term &quot;tuning&quot; and sometimes used to mean a fundamental melodic<br/>reference frame.  McLaren talks about new scales, classifying<br/>them as 1/3-tone, 1/4-tone, etc. -- apparently discussing new<br/>tunings of the diatonic scale.  Paul Erlich often uses the word<br/>in the latter sense, proposing &quot;scales&quot; which are intended to<br/>provide a non-diatonic reference frame.  Here, fourths and<br/>fifths become entirely different classes of intervals, and the<br/>situation that McLaren mentions of a fifth being a 3:2 and a<br/>third being a 5:4 no longer applies.  Rothenberg has created a<br/>detailed model of scales as reference frames.  For him, a scale<br/>is something which can exist in many different tunings.  We all<br/>know that the diatonic scale can exist in Pythagorean and<br/>meantone tunings, and Rothenberg asks why this is so, and what<br/>the limits of this sort of thing are.</p><p>To say that theory is useless, does this include the theory that<br/>allows us to be aware of microtonal music in the first place?<br/>Obviously, all musicians use microtones at some point, if not<br/>regularly -- but they do it unconsciously.  It takes a<br/>tremendous body of theory to take that and allow instead what we<br/>hear out of people like McLaren and Grady.  This is all useless?</p><p>Useless, &apos;without direct, hands-on experience composing actual<br/>music&apos; is the qualifier that may be implied here.  But if Dave<br/>Keenan comes up with a tuning that somebody else uses to make<br/>music, was Dave&apos;s effort useless?  This is basic division of<br/>labor.  At the same time, the fact that many of history&apos;s most<br/>famous music theorists were also composers didn&apos;t stop them from<br/>producing a body of theory that is mostly hogwash.  McLaren has<br/>already spent much ink providing the example of Schoenberg here.<br/>On the other hand, people like Euler came up with very useful<br/>theory, which was then picked up by Fokker and Wilson, and which<br/>resulted in music by the Dutch 31-toners, Rod Poole, Kraig<br/>Grady, and countless others.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3>David J.

When I was in grade school, I<br/>was sometimes puzzled by hearing third tone chromatic passages in my<br/>head.  That is, I needed third tones to accomplish what I wanted<br/>to hear the musical parts doing.  It made me feel that I was a<br/>very strange person, something which I have continued to prove ever<br/>since :-)  That was before I could even really read music very well,<br/>when the extent of my musical knowledge involved singing harmony in<br/>church and playing ukulele and trumpet by ear.  So I think one can<br/>become aware of what we call microtonality strictly by ear, without<br/>any more knowledge of theory than the most basic necessary to his/her<br/>native music system.</p><p>David</p></div>
