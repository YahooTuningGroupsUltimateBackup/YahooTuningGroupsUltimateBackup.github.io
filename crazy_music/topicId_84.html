It is perhaps only 3 or 4 hundred years<br/>ago that we find instruments that resembles the ones we see today. There<br/>is much controversy as to which what came first Pelog or Slendro as it<br/>appears they were not both present that far back. The music itself is<br/>always changing too. The recordings made by McPhee represent music that<br/>is no longer in existence except as a basis for new styles. With the<br/>introduction of the Rebab, we see the Persian influence, but not all<br/>Indonesia is Islamic. Bali is Hindu and by the way, credit their tuning<br/>as being brought by a Princess of China. Of course,  China is on the<br/>silk road  and they in turn had dealing with the mid east :)<br/>Last week i played on my radio show a performer from Yemen who used a<br/>copper tray instrument which is played as a fingered percussion<br/>instrument. The liner notes remarked that the alloy was the same as the<br/>gongs found in Indonesia. hmmmm..</p><p>&quot;X. J.
