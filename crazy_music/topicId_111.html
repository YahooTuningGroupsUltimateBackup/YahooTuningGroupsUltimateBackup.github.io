I can see that as &quot;horizontal&quot; which<br/>&gt; horizontal meaning human experience, and vertical meaning divine.</p><p>Ties in with what David said about the Hurdy Gurdy piece in PMG as<br/>a Reneissance fair piece. Yes, I&apos;d agree exactly with your description.<br/>Does also have a kind of subtle beauty too from the tiny semitone step<br/>in the diatonic scale.</p><p>I&apos;ve done a 17-tet diatonic improvisation to try to bring that out, as<br/>usual:<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tunes/tunes.htm">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tunes/tunes.htm</a></p><p>There&apos;s a poss. of going into a kind of a trance when listening to my<br/>improvisations and relaxing, - doesn&apos;t happen to me, but know of someone who<br/>did.</p><p>Found this interesting page by Ivor Darreg about<br/>moods of n-tet:<br/><a href="http://www.furious.com/perfect/xenharmonics.html">http://www.furious.com/perfect/xenharmonics.html</a></p><p>&quot;<br/>I could explain here that the seventeen-tone system turns certain common<br/>rules of harmony upside-down: major thirds are dissonances which resolve<br/>into fourths instead of the other way round: certain other intervals resolve<br/>into major seconds; the pentatonic scale takes on a very exciting mood<br/>when mapped onto the 17 equally-spaced tones, and so on; but I can&apos;t<br/>expect you to believe me until you hear all this yourself. If you try<br/>to play these pieces in another system, it just doesn&apos;t work; they<br/>lose their punch; the magic is all gone.<br/>&quot;</p><p>Found it while following up a link from the Huygens-Fokker Foundation<br/>biography of him:<br/><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/english/darreg.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/english/darreg.html</a></p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=113 href="#113">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>6/5/2001 2:21:50 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>scale.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve done a 17-tet diatonic improvisation to try to bring that out,<br/>as<br/>&gt; usual:<br/>&gt; <a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tunes/tunes.htm">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tunes/tunes.htm</a></p><p>I seem to be trancing so easily with it I can&apos;t hear any sound at<br/>all:-)  YOur other pieces play fine so I think the problem is<br/>specific to this piece.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;<br/>&gt; I could explain here that the seventeen-tone system turns certain<br/>common<br/>&gt; rules of harmony upside-down: major thirds are dissonances which<br/>resolve<br/>&gt; into fourths instead of the other way round: certain other<br/>intervals resolve<br/>&gt; into major seconds; the pentatonic scale takes on a very exciting<br/>mood<br/>&gt; when mapped onto the 17 equally-spaced tones, and so on; but I can&apos;t<br/>&gt; expect you to believe me until you hear all this yourself.

Ah the sweet<br/>mysteries of Windows 98.</p><p>About three minutes into the 17 TET piece I did find myself nodding<br/>into alpha, although there was one dissonant chord that brought me<br/>right back.  Perhaps there is something to harmonic entropy where<br/>trancing is falling into those dips in the curve :-)</p><p>Dan let me add words of encouragement to getting your stuff into mp3 -<br/> it is good, and it is 2001.
