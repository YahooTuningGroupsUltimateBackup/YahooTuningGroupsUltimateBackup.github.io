To wit, numbers. That good ole<br/>&gt; fix of pure uncut pharmaceutical grade math exerts a potent addictive<br/>&gt; pull.<br/>&gt;          But before we all tie our arms off with rubber hoses and<br/>&gt; start slapping our veins frantically while heating up numbers in<br/>&gt; dirty spoons, several caveats.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     As examples of the radical difference which composition style can<br/>&gt; make in the overall &quot;sound&quot; of a tuning, compare the very short mp3<br/>&gt; files IVOR53.mp3 with MCL53.mp3.<br/>&gt;     This 53-tone equal composition remains one of the most savage and<br/>&gt; brutal pieces that ever appeared  univited in my studio and started<br/>&gt; knocking over lamps and spray-painting the walls with graffiti. By<br/>&gt; contrast, Ivor Darreg&apos;s 53-tone-equal composition sits on a velvet<br/>&gt; cushion and licks its paws while purring mellifluously -- housebroken<br/>&gt; yet. Oy gevalt. Such a kitten.</p><p>Brian, your metaphorical imagery is just irresistable!</p><p>Thanks for the details on your 37-limit piece, even without the<br/>dreaded math, and for the other sound files illustrating your thoughts.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=207 href="#207">ðŸ”—</a>Robert C Valentine &#x3C;BVAL@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/4/2001 4:11:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Brian,</p><p>&lt;snip of lots of good tidbits&gt;</p><p>I would like you to elaborate on the idea of a relationship<br/>between rhythm and modal  material. I feel like my own experience<br/>doesn&apos;t &quot;click&quot; with what uoui suggested. I find that I will<br/>freely use harmony melody and rhythm to &quot;contradict&quot; each other<br/>(to provide &quot;balance&quot;) or &quot;agree&quot; (to provide &quot;exageration&quot;).</p><p>(Melody, rhythm and harmony are my fundamental ingredients.<br/>I am trying to get away from harmony and more into<br/>multi-melodic writing, and for whatever reason, I don&apos;t deal<br/>too much with timbre in the composition process, as that is<br/>usually a performance issue for me).</p><p>&gt;         Hands-on musical experience shows that MOS procedures can<br/>&gt; lead to dead ends. MOS theories can produce musically unproductive<br/>&gt; results in prime numbers of tones per octave. Alas, some of the more<br/>&gt; interesting equal divisions of the octave remain prime numbered<br/>&gt; divisions.</p><p>Why do you find &quot;prime numbers of tones per octave&quot; any more<br/>&quot;musically unproductive&quot; than non-prime?</p><p>&gt;         In any case, even in composite numbers of equal tones per<br/>&gt; octave, Erv Wilson&apos;s MOS scales should be thought of as tools, not<br/>&gt; monuments. The problem with making a cult out of Erv&apos;s ideas is that<br/>&gt; Erv offers provocative speculations intended to spark the<br/>&gt; imagination, not edifices for pilgrims to worship at. Erv&apos;s ideas<br/>&gt; serve best as starting points, not termini. In my own experience, my<br/>&gt; compositions have not benefited from using Erv&apos;s ideas about MOS<br/>&gt; subsets as modes. My modes (and those of many others I&apos;ve made music<br/>&gt; with) tend to involve quirky asymmetrical oddball subsets. And as Erv<br/>&gt; himself has remarked, &quot;Excessive symmetry can become a fetish.&quot;</p><p>Sure. There are tons of good scales that are not MOS. If we look<br/>at scales that have been used successfully while being mapped to<br/>12-eq, melodic minor and harmonic minor (and related modes) are<br/>not MOS.</p><p>My interest in MOS came from trying to come up with what I called<br/>&quot;transposable systems&quot; (with perfect preservation of intervals after<br/>applying a single &quot;alteration&quot;) which naturally led back to there.</p><p>Applying the &quot;alteration&quot; to the &quot;wrong note&quot; in a MOS does seem<br/>seem to be a path (or coincidence) to other interesting scales. Such<br/>a relationship exists with those I mentioned, at least when mapped<br/>into 12 equal. I have seen this to be true of some others I have<br/>looked at.</p><p>&gt;     In Ludwig Wittgenstein&apos;s &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,&quot; L. W.<br/>&gt; makes a remark in his penultimate proposition.  Wittgenstein points<br/>&gt; out  that the entire book serves as a ladder which the adroit<br/>&gt; philosopher will, having climbed it, throw away. Erv has said as much<br/>&gt; to me about his various musical systems.  The same probably applies<br/>&gt; to anyone who hopes to create worthwhile music in any realm, whether<br/>&gt; xenharmonic or not.</p><p>Absolutely. The common phrase among jazz musicians is something like<br/>&quot;learn all your scales, then forget about &apos;em and play&quot;. There is<br/>some zen adage like &quot;first you see the forest, then the trees, and<br/>then the forest&quot;. In the music that I am most comfortable, I feel<br/>like I&apos;m in the &quot;second forest&quot; stage. For that which I am not<br/>so experienced (including but not limited to microtonal composition),<br/>I am somewhere between seeing the first forest and the trees.</p><p>&gt;      ------------<br/>&gt;     While various folks effused over the earlier post discussing the<br/>&gt; &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;sonic fingerpint&quot; of various 1/3-tone tunings, not one<br/>&gt; single person has yet demanded proof.<br/>&gt;      Skepticism.<br/>&gt;      A word to the wise, folks.<br/>&gt;      The first question you should ask is: &quot;Oh yeah?  Prove it!&quot;</p><p>Comparison of two compositions in 53 deleted. It is probably even<br/>simpler to compare many of the different musics performed in 12.</p><p>There may well be some tunings that are so inflexible that they<br/>have a one-true-character that can only be massaged by individual<br/>composers intent, perhaps some of the very low ETs. I dunno.</p><p>A question of terminology, what do you mean by 1/3-tone in this<br/>context?</p><p>&gt;       However, if (as usual) no one else bothers to post MP3 examples<br/>&gt; of the remaining 1/3-tone tuning 15 and 17 and 19 equal here, it will<br/>&gt; once again fall to me to do so in the near future.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
