Yeaahhhh...</p><p>OK, now I can come &apos;out of the closet&apos; regarding my<br/>hidden feelings about John deLaubenfels&apos; adaptive<br/>tuning, the subject of a certain amount of controversy.</p><p>I accept that John actually likes those consonant<br/>low-limit chords. And I believe that he hears things<br/>the way he does. And that is fine. EVERYBODY has<br/>programmed their neural networks differently and<br/>projective value judgements are impossible. We can only<br/>describe what we ourselves hear and have no ability to<br/>hear what other people do.</p><p>I listen to all the examples he puts up of well know<br/>music he&apos;s retuned and it drives me nuts!

I can hardly bear to listen to<br/>it!</p><p>I remain quiet though since I see there is potential.</p><p>But I know that his whole system is under development<br/>and so I trudge on, obediently listening to each new<br/>example, hoping that *someday* I won&apos;t be irritable and<br/>annoyed after listening to these brutal abominations!!</p><p>Today is that day!</p><p>Instead of some *old* composition which most decidedly<br/>was *not* written for low limit just intonation (and<br/>for which it should possibly be a criminal offense to<br/>so deface :-) ), here we have a new composition,<br/>written with modern ears, and tested on the system.</p><p>It&apos;s great! I love it!</p><p>(I love Bailey&apos;s oog too -- he is a composer to be<br/>reckoned with, that&apos;s for sure. We don&apos;t hear much from<br/>him but it is universally of the highest quality.)</p><p>CONGRATULATIONS JOHN AND CHRIS!!!</p><p>The tool of jdl style adaptive tuning has found an<br/>audience and a use. It is no longer experimental -- I<br/>declare it good enough for government work, and perhaps<br/>even more! :)</p><p>And it&apos;s not as consonant as before -- maybe Chris has<br/>managed to fool the system, to prevent it from tracking<br/>his every harmonic move. Perhaps the excitement I hear<br/>is the conflict between Chris trying to escape the evil<br/>consonance while John resolutely pursues him,<br/>desperately trying to make everything smooth! If so,<br/>maybe Chris isn&apos;t using the tool for what it was<br/>intended but none of that matters. All that matters is<br/>that the music is funny and fresh and interesting and a<br/>real delight! Chris, you took on a difficult challenge,<br/>one I woud have said was impossible, but you have<br/>succeeded fabulously!</p><p>It kicks ass, Chris! You&apos;ve got some real cajones to<br/>accept the challenge and succeed at the impossible in<br/>so conclusive and definitive a manner. I respect you.</p><p>Great stuff! Keep up the good work both of you!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=415 href="#415">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/15/2001 4:41:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Jeff Scott wrote:]<br/>&gt;OK, now I can come &apos;out of the closet&apos; regarding my<br/>&gt;hidden feelings about John deLaubenfels&apos; adaptive<br/>&gt;tuning, the subject of a certain amount of controversy.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I accept that John actually likes those consonant<br/>&gt;low-limit chords.

I&apos;ll take that as a negative response ;-&gt;.<br/>Just out of curiosity, do you feel this about the 5-lim and the 7-lim<br/>tunings, or mainly the 7?  For example, the Mozart K.280, if you&apos;ve<br/>heard it (it&apos;s on my web page) - to me, the 5-limit sounds very mild.</p><p>I like Christopher&apos;s piece a lot, too.  To my ear, though, retuning it<br/>is no more or less appropriate than retuning older works.  Guess we&apos;ll<br/>have to agree to disagree about that, which is fine.</p><p>I want everyone to know it&apos;s ok to say you don&apos;t like what I do.  The<br/>only comments that frustrate me are ones from people who condemn without<br/>actually listening.  I&apos;d rather get a true and accurate picture of<br/>whether I&apos;m succeeding in pleasing than get a whitewash.  Nobody needs<br/>to be &quot;in the closet&quot;.</p><p>Certainly my ultimate goal is to use my techniques on new music, my own<br/>and/or others&apos;.</p><p>Chris, any idea when the other movement(s) of your sonata may be ready?<br/>Can&apos;t wait to hear &apos;em!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=433 href="#433">ðŸ”—</a>jstarret@...</h3><span>7/15/2001 9:39:18 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; I want everyone to know it&apos;s ok to say you don&apos;t like what I do.<br/>&gt;The<br/>&gt; only comments that frustrate me are ones from people who condemn<br/>&gt;without<br/>&gt; actually listening.

I like what your adaptive tuning<br/>does, to Chris&apos; music as well as to that of the old masters. I<br/>disagree strongly with those who say that the Three Bs and Mozart<br/>(and everyone else, for that matter, including Partch) wrote for the<br/>capabilites of the instruments of their times, so that&apos;s what they<br/>wanted their music to sound like. It&apos;s a mighty poor composer<br/>whose mind&apos;s ear is no better than the performance by others on<br/>imperfect instruments. Of course, a modern reinterpreter should really<br/>understand the music well to redo it properly. I think what you are<br/>doing would probably have been appreciated by the old rogues.</p><p>However, I like to be surprised, and I actually enjoyed the perversity<br/>of the sudden comma shifts in your very first efforts. It was almost<br/>like a barbershop quartet retuning on the fly to the lead vocalist. If<br/>your adaptive retuning program becomes a commercial product, I hope it<br/> will be flexible enough so that men of ill will can do all kinds of<br/>naughty tricks to innocent midi files.</p></div><h3><a id=435 href="#435">ðŸ”—</a>X.
