I&apos;ve re-joined crazy_music only long enough to post<br/>the following:</p><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., xed@e... wrote:<br/>&gt; FROM: mclaren<br/>&gt; TO: new practical microtonality list<br/>&gt; SUBJECT: The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but<br/>&gt;    the truth<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;Metatuning digest Message 305 of 325</p><p>I posted that message on the metatuning list, a list specifically<br/>created to improve the signal to noise ratio on the<br/>other, &apos;informative&apos; lists; as such, I won&apos;t respond to it here. If<br/>Brian would like to discuss this on metatuning, where I still<br/>maintain a membership and where it is relevant, fine. I have no<br/>reason to avoid the issue, but I won&apos;t write any more about it on<br/>*this* list, because:</p><p>1. all of you should get back to making music<br/>2. I&apos;m unsubscribing once again as soon as I send this</p><p>I sincerely hope that each and every one of you can understand that I<br/>would like to preserve the (potential) peace on this list.</p><p>Regards to all,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=371 href="#371">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/13/2001 1:41:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Brian wrote:</p><p>&gt;   The 4 MP3 files EXAMPLE1 and EXAMPLE2 and<br/>&gt; EXAMPLE3 and EXAMPLE4 contain excerpts from<br/>&gt; the actual pieces of music played at the concert<br/>&gt; Jonathan Szanto reviewed.</p><p>You know, I really admire your courage in allowing us to hear these.<br/>Well, in a spirit of free exchange I&apos;ve made a not-so-good example of<br/>my own music available.
