Unless yo do that, you&apos;re apt to run off half-<br/>&gt; cocked and wind up convincing yourself of a bunch of things<br/>&gt; that just aren&apos;t true... For example, that recognizable perfect<br/>&gt; fifths only reside within a narrow range (say, + or - 5 or<br/>&gt; 6 cents from the just 3/2) or that (in Graham Breed&apos;s startlingly<br/>&gt; false words &quot;[the equal temperaments without recognizable<br/>&gt; perfect fifths, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 23] are musically useless.&quot;</p><p>I can&apos;t find the words you attribute to me.  I assume this is another<br/>misquote of what I said in</p><p>&lt;<a href="/crazy_music/topicId_238.html#238">/crazy_music/topicId_238.html#238</a>&gt;</p><p>&gt;     Lastly, the most musically expansive and in all likelihood<br/>&gt; the richest musical frontier for microtonalist, namely, non-just<br/>&gt; non-equal-tempered tunings, are just out of bounds for a guitarist.<br/>&gt; Even if you can tune up the NJ NET scale your timbre&apos;s all wrong.<br/>&gt; You need inharmonic timbres to really take advantages of NJ NET<br/>&gt; tunings.</p><p>This is not true.  I have a guitar fretting that is neither just nor<br/>equally tempered.  It works great.  You can hear &quot;Celestial Radishes&quot;<br/>at the Tuning Punks<br/>&lt;<a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/72/the_tuning_punks.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/72/the_tuning_punks.html</a>&gt; page.</p><p>&gt;     Other than that, though, the prospects remain tough for<br/>&gt; the microtonal guitarist.</p><p>The prospects are fine for microtonal guitarists, but we&apos;ll have to<br/>go about it a different way to what you approve of.</p><p>So how much experience of playing guitars with different frettings<br/>did you build up before writing this post?  Are you going to upload<br/>examples for us?</p><p>                       Graham</p></div>
