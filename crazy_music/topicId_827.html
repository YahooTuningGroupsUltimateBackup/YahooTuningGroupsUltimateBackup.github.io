Sometimes I use finger<br/>shading to help.</p><p>Then, one notices many gentle fluctuations of pitch of<br/>the melody. It is wonderful the way these fit in with<br/>the flow of the tune, for instance, pitch tends to go<br/>up at the climax of a phrase if it is conclusive<br/>(including end of the movement) while down if<br/>it is leading into something else. Not sure why that<br/>is but it works very nicely.</p><p>Then when it really comes together, what one notices is<br/>the way all three parts work together harmonically, rather<br/>than each going its separate way somewhat. When you hear<br/>the harpsichord pitch changing to fit in with your<br/>tune, it almost feels like there is a live player there<br/>playing with you. As much of such a feeling as one gets<br/>from rhythmic responsiveness (of which there is none<br/>in this as I sequenced the original midi clip in<br/>NWC with a steady tempo of crotchet=79).</p><p>This is in John&apos;s version targetting 9/10 for the dom7th<br/>except when the fifth of the chord is missing when it targets<br/>the 8/9.</p><p>This is of course an amateur recording of the piece, but I hope my<br/>enthusiasm and evident enjoyment of playing with the<br/>adaptively tuned keyboard makes it worth listening to.<br/>It was perhaps originally written for amateurs to perform<br/>as it is very easy.</p><p>(After practicing a bit more I&apos;ll maybe try another<br/>take).</p><p>Played on tenor recorder.</p><p>The baroque flute had a narrower range than the modern flute,<br/>and many pieces for flute up to just short of J.S. Bach,<br/>(and the Bach flute sonatas too, if you can manage the occasional<br/>rather high notes) are playable on recorder.</p><p>This movement has a high C# in it which is a tricky note on recorder<br/>- I use the fingering<br/>0 1 &iuml;&iquest;&half; 3 4 &iuml;&iquest;&half; 6 7, which works on most recorders. It&apos;s in the first<br/>high phrase the recorder plays.</p><p>As for timbre, I think perhaps the recorder is a reasonable stand<br/>in for baroque flute, - if you can play it on modern flute, then<br/>why not on recorder?</p><p>It is a great pleasure to play the recorder with adaptively tuned<br/>harpsichord in this piece, and though quarter comma meantone is<br/>also nice (possibly original intention to judge by how nice it<br/>sounds), the adaptive tuning of these pieces is so incomparably<br/>much nicer to play with. You really can relax and enjoy the<br/>music as you play!</p><p>Sorry about the false start - haven&apos;t quite mastered knack of<br/>starting playback just as I begin to play the recorder.</p><p>I just do it by playing the keyboard part in MediaPlayer and recording<br/>while I play along on the recorder - no editing!</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=829 href="#829">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>8/2/2001 1:48:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Robert</p><p>I like it too a lot.

In this<br/>instrument the common quality of a recorder note of<br/>appearing to sound an octave below its actual pitch<br/>(through the absence of prominent upper harmonics) is at its<br/>most evident.&quot;<br/>(chapter III, kinds of recorders: choosing an instrument)</p><p>Try playing violin, flute, and recorder in that order on your soundcard.</p><p>Try say, the G, lowest note of violin. You may find it<br/>sounds lowest on recorder.</p><p>It is a matter of how one listens, and the context<br/>in which it plays, and I think the Bass recorder in recorder<br/>consort sounds as if it goes a lot lower than a violin,<br/>rather than just one note lower.</p><p>I think also soprano recorder does sound rather as though<br/>its lowest note is middle c somehow, though one can also<br/>hear it as the note an octave above. In fact, I think<br/>it sounds rather as if it has a three octaves + range somehow<br/>- the second register (on my one anyway), has much more<br/>prominent second partials than the first register, and<br/>sounds more in pitch, while first register sounds more<br/>below the measured pitch..</p><p>But why? Well you&apos;re our principal theorist on<br/>these sorts of matters!</p><p>My thoughts about it are, that maybe the first partial<br/>is interpreted as a second partial, with a weak missing<br/>first partial below it, so weak that one can&apos;t hear it<br/>at all.</p><p>I&apos;d be interested to know if harp has same effect - on<br/>my soundcard anyway, it has a very prominent first harmonic,<br/>as does steel drums and marimba.</p><p>There is an even larger size of recorder than the great Bass,<br/>the contrabass.</p><p>It still wouldn&apos;t quite get down to the<br/>lowest note of the &apos;cello - lowest note F rather than C.</p><p>Even lower recorders have been built. I&apos;ve seen a picture of one<br/>in C from a museum (same lowest note as &apos;cello) - you could<br/>only reach the mouthpiece of this particular model by<br/>standing on something.</p><p>Seems they&apos;ve started making them again:<br/><a href="http://www.contrabass.com/pages/big-recorders.html">http://www.contrabass.com/pages/big-recorders.html</a><br/>- folded air passage I think from the picture. I&apos;m not<br/>clear about the scale from this picture.</p><p>I&apos;ve just discovered that Dolmetsch are making a new range<br/>of contra bass recorders:</p><p><a href="http://www.be-blood.demon.co.uk/millennium.htm">http://www.be-blood.demon.co.uk/millennium.htm</a></p><p>Right down to a recorder _two octaves_ lower than<br/>the Bass recorder - can&apos;t iimagine how they&apos;ll make<br/>that one a playable size!</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=834 href="#834">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/2/2001 4:55:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>N.b. why was it you thought notes should sound<br/>higher in pitch with 1st as strongest partial?</p><p>Can you explain a bit more?</p><p>I don&apos;t know the reference you gave.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=854 href="#854">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2001 3:56:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Hi Paul,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; N.b. why was it you thought notes should sound<br/>&gt; higher in pitch with 1st as strongest partial?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Can you explain a bit more?<br/>&gt;<br/>That&apos;s not exactly what I said . . . but when the cochlea is exposed<br/>to more than one frequency at once, the pitches are<br/>subjectively &quot;stretched apart&quot; compared to how they sound as isolated<br/>sine waves.

Glad you enjoy the tuning.  Wow,<br/>&gt; the piece is harder than I realized just listening to the MIDI notes<br/>&gt; go by.  I actually learned to play the recorder years ago; still have<br/>&gt; a soprano and alto somewhere (C and F respectively, right?).  How much<br/>&gt; total range did you say this piece has again?  Much more than I could<br/>&gt; play, much less tune on the fly, I&apos;m sure!</p><p>In this movement it&apos;s two octaves plus a whole tone: c - d&apos;&apos;.<br/>The notes in this movement are straightforward to play, even the c#&apos;&apos;,<br/>though that one often gets left out of the fingering charts. It is sweet and easy<br/>speaking, but involves a fair number of finger movements to get to it<br/>from some notes, especially with the thumb hole needing to be covered<br/>as well.</p><p>The c# with the fingering I use has a tendency to be just a little sharp unless<br/>very quiet - it is basically a d&apos;&apos; flattened as much as one can towards the c&apos;&apos;,<br/>and some recorders can go further down more easily than others, or have other<br/>alternate fingerings for it.</p><p>In my recorder technique book he says</p><p>&quot;This is the bugbear of recorder players. F&apos;&apos; sharp is obtainable by a number of<br/>methods, but none of them is entirely satisfactory&quot;.<br/>(F&apos;&apos; # because he is writing for treble).</p><p>Just after explaining the leaking finger technique for F&apos;&apos;# which is the one I use<br/>usually, and here, he says:</p><p>&quot;A third method of getting F&apos;&apos;# is to use the flattened G&apos;&apos; just described<br/>and flatten it still further by shading the hole in the foot of the recorder<br/>against the knee. Carefully done, this is effective, but a little odd&quot;.</p><p>Maybe I should give it a go! However generally I hold the recorder horizontally<br/>(all except the bass recorder), much like a flute, as it is more relaxing<br/>for the fingers I find, so could be a bit awkward.</p><p>Here I just played it a little sharp (compared with prev. played note in harpsichord<br/>part), but I think it works like that as a kind of leading tone to the high d&apos;&apos;, and<br/>one prob. doesn&apos;t notice unless one has it pointed out.</p><p>High c&apos;&apos; in 3rd octave is the note that usually breaks<br/>most easily. Trick there is to learn the breath pressure and the width<br/>of gap for the thumb hole. If one gets those right then it is<br/>straightforward at normal volume (not easy to play quietly).</p><p>Get the thumb hole gap right (narrower than for any of the notes<br/>of the second octave and can vary dep. on the recorder),<br/>and the breath pressure a little stronger than for the 2nd octave<br/>notes, and you will get a decent note every time<br/>you play it. Then one can learn to find the &quot;sweet spot&quot; where it<br/>sounds nicest.</p><p>So this movement is basically pretty straightforward, if you don&apos;t<br/>mind a slightly sharp c&apos;&apos;#, or maybe if you are able to try the knee<br/>shading technique (??). (and if you play simple ornaments).</p><p>The other movements both use the high E of 3rd octave which is outside the range of<br/>many of the recorder fingering charts. It has tendency to be<br/>flat and need to be sharpened. However, does very good service as<br/>a 5/4 above the C just as it is, and is only a little harder to play<br/>than the C (needs _far more_ breath pressure, and can be played<br/>reasonably softly with care).</p><p>The J.S. Bach flute sonatas and the wonderful J.S. Bach sonata for solo flute<br/>have higher notes such as g&apos;&apos;, and I&apos;ve practiced those as well in the<br/>past and they are also fairly accessible on recorder as regards range<br/>(of course I play the fast movements slower - they are virtuoso<br/>flute pieces but they work pretty well a bit slower than they are normally<br/>played).</p><p>The g&apos;&apos; doesn&apos;t sound too bad in these as it is usually in a suitable<br/>place for a strongly accented note which is the way it comes out on the<br/>recorder naturally. Teleman actually notatated this note for treble recorder<br/>in one of his recorder sonatas, used in exactly this way - I think the<br/>notes said that it is thought to be the highest note ever<br/>written for recorder before the C20.</p><p>There&apos;s a CPE Bach solo flute sonata too, in A minor, and it is<br/>pretty straightforward too, though meant to be much faster than I could possibly<br/>play it, but it is so high for so long that it is quite demanding on recorder.</p><p>&gt;Sorry about the false start - haven&apos;t quite mastered knack of<br/>&gt;starting playback just as I begin to play the recorder.</p><p>&gt;I just do it by playing the keyboard part in MediaPlayer and recording<br/>&gt;while I play along on the recorder - no editing!</p><p>&gt; Hey, you really should get CoolEdit 2000 with the Studio plug-in, about<br/>&gt; $100 total and gives you GREAT editing of up to four stereo tracks<br/>&gt; (more, of course, if you mix some down, then add others, etc.).  When<br/>&gt; you&apos;re layering the recorder over the harpsichord, for example, you&apos;d<br/>&gt; _see_ the first note coming on screen.</p><p>That does sound good. I could imagine using all of them, e.g. for a recorder<br/>consort playing all the parts, which could be fun to try, especially if in some<br/>xenharmonic scale. I want to get more into microtonal recorder playing.</p><p>Seeing the note in advance as you come to it would be great.</p><p>I&apos;ll have to think about this. I actually have the CoolEdit demo<br/>at present which I mainly used for checking FFT type things, and<br/>hasn&apos;t yet expired as I use it so rarely. I now do FFT mostly in<br/>FTS. Hadn&apos;t realised it&apos;s audio capablilities. I use Goldwave, and<br/>I&apos;ve registered that program, which I enjoy using, but sound sas though<br/>CoolEdit has capabilities it doesn&apos;t have.</p><p>&gt; I&apos;d love to hear the last movement of that J.C. Bach flute sonata too;<br/>&gt; it&apos;s really sweet.</p><p>Okay, better get practicing :-). Takes me a while to memorise the<br/>movement - that was the key to getting it reasonably presentable,<br/>as until I did that, wasn&apos;t to give pitch my proper attention while<br/>playing, only afterwards.</p><p>I can still hear many wild notes, so I&apos; msure the keen eared readers<br/>of this group can too, but they don&apos;t seem too out of place somehow.</p><p>I&apos;m so glad you like it, and I think one can hear how much I<br/>enjoy playing with adaptively tuned keyboard!</p><p>One nice little touch I noticed while learning it - C.P.E. Bach<br/>puts one unison note for recorder and harpsichord in this piece.<br/>It is pretty much exactly half way at bar 22 out of 56, and also<br/>half way through the longest section of continuous playing for<br/>the recorder. Accompaniment consists of C at octaves at that<br/>point.</p><p>Just the exact place where it is great to have a<br/>kind of steadying re-assurance from the keyboard part. I wonder if<br/>it is there to help steady potentially nervous or forgetful amateurs?</p><p>It&apos;s nice anyway.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
