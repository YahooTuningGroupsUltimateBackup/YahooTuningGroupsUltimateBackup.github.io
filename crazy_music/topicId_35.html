I don&apos;t know anyone who<br/>&gt; has ever heard back from yahoo about anything so I<br/>&gt; don&apos;t know if they will respond to my email. I imagine<br/>&gt; they get reams of email every day and can&apos;t answer it all.</p><p>I heard back from Yahoo. The e-mail address <a href="mailto:support@yahoogroups.com">support@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>no longer applies, though it appears on all their error messages.<br/>E-mail to that address never gets replied to.</p><p>See<br/><a href="http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/groups/groups-39.html">http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/groups/groups-39.html</a></p><p>Instead what one needs to do if one wants to e-mail them about the groups<br/>is to visit one of the help pages, click the no button to say that it isn&apos;t<br/>enough information, and fill in a feedback form</p><p>Then you might get a reply.</p><p>I know your web space question isn&apos;t about yahoogroups, but may be useful<br/>information at some point.</p><p>This newsgroup is for discussion of things to do with list owner help.<br/><a href="http://www.escribe.com/internet/loh">http://www.escribe.com/internet/loh</a></p><p>Got a reply after a week. A week or so ago, they stopped my account<br/>for apparently auto-responding when I uploaded more than 50 messages<br/>in a few minutes, as a test of my program to forward e-mail.</p><p>Their reply explained the 50 messages in 20 minutes rule, and put<br/>me back on again.</p><p>(though I found out about it before by internet search too).</p><p>&gt; I will probably reupload to the group directory and then<br/>&gt; those with high speed connections should be able to get<br/>&gt; it. Others will get the first minute or so.</p><p>Do please, I missed getting it too.</p><p>On subject of free isps, I use NCBI, and they never have had<br/>any problems, and been easy to contact if I need to know more about<br/>something. Unlimited bandwidth, and unlimited space, though<br/>have to have rather large banner.</p><p>However, they don&apos;t host mp3s. (I mostly use midi at present, so doesn&apos;t<br/>affect me).</p><p>Several sites list the top free ISPs, such as this one:</p><p><a href="http://100best-free-web-space.com/Top10_banner.htm">http://100best-free-web-space.com/Top10_banner.htm</a></p><p>May be worth a browse around. Haven&apos;t specifically looked for good<br/>sites for mp3s.</p><p>I look forward to hearing your music, even if it is just<br/>the first minute or so that gets downloaded!</p><p>Robert</p></div>
