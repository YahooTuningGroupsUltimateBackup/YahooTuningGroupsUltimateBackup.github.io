I&apos;m sure there are things<br/>left out in the explanations in the help - so keep asking<br/>until I&apos;ve explained everything you need to know, and / or made<br/>any extra additions or changes needed.</p><p>It implements a version of the retuning side of Carl Lumma&apos;s spec.</p><p>Assumption is that any sequencing work is done in your sequencer<br/>/ score editor, and that you relay it from there to FTS for retuning,<br/>e.g. using Midi Yoke, or whatever method you use for midi relaying.</p><p>For example, for root control, you&apos;ll set the root by playing a midi<br/>note in one of the midi channels in your sequencer (say, channel 1),<br/>and relaying it to FTS, while relaying the notes for actually playing<br/>in the other channels.</p><p>Alternatively, you can split your midi keyboard into regions and<br/>set the root by playing a note in appropriate region of the midi<br/>keyboard. Or use a foot pedal, slider, wheel etc. to change the<br/>root control.</p><p>Has multiple simultaneous root control, and retuning either<br/>with comma shifts, or comma drift.</p><p>Also has a method for selection of triads, tetrads, hexanies etc. from CPS<br/>sets, and more generally, select notes from any scale according to the<br/>factors, and number of factors.</p><p>One important thing isn&apos;t implemented yet. When you change the root,<br/>it applies only to notes played after it. All notes still in play<br/>keep whatever tuning they have (Keenan Pepper&apos;s &quot;crunchy&quot;).</p><p>Retuning notes already in play will need a little extra thought.<br/>That&apos;s because they will be all shifting in varying directions.<br/>E.g. change root by a major third, then each note needs to<br/>be retuned to the nearest note in the new scale, rather than<br/>just shift them all up by a major third, which would be<br/>easy to do.</p><p>It will be straightforward to do this, but not done yet.<br/>Also plan to add a sostenuto like effect too, where you<br/>can use a pedal to select which of the notes you want to<br/>keep in the old tuning before change of root, and which<br/>ones you want to retune.</p><p>Some more coding is needed to take account of compound factors<br/>such as 9 in CPS sets.</p><p>I hope that the format is close enough to the final version<br/>to not need very major changes. However, there could be<br/>some changes I expect, so the next few days is prob. a time for<br/>experimentation (unless it&apos;s a once off, or you want to be tied<br/>down to always using this particular beta preview when you edit<br/>your piece!)</p><p>Also, a few bugs would be expected at this stage. None known<br/>as of writing.</p><p>Have fun with it!</p><p>I plan to take a day or two off and have a go at playing with it too...</p><p>:-)</p><p>Robert</p></div>
