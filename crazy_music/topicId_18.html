(I have all except the early<br/>ones).</p><p>I could also get it to generate a list of the e-mail addresses of all<br/>those who posted, since the complete e-mail addresses are shown in<br/>the digests, and then we could mail to them all and ask if they are<br/>happy for their posts to be re-posted, which would also be a way of<br/>letting everyone know about the new group (as some of the members<br/>don&apos;t belong to the tuning list).</p><p>I haven&apos;t quite figured out how to program to send an e-mail with the<br/>original author of the post as the apparent originator of the<br/>e-mail, so the re-posted messages would all have to show up<br/>under my name as author, but would be shown as forwarded messages</p><p>Like this:</p><p>In messages listings:</p><p>Author: Robert Walker<br/>Subject: FW: Re: Wooden frets?! - David J.

If you go over that<br/>number, then Yahoo&apos;s detection system for auto-responding<br/>goes into effect.</p><p>Yahoo&apos;s problem here is the &quot;I am on vacation&quot; type message<br/>that some people set as an automatic response to an incoming<br/>e-mail. Suppose also they are on individual e-mail subscription.<br/>Their p.c. gets an e-mail from a Yahoo group, replies with the<br/>&quot;I am on vacation&quot; response, that gets relayed back to them<br/>as a post from the group, their p.c. replies to that saying<br/>&quot;I am on vacation&quot; again, ...</p><p>So, would upload at rate of one message every 30 seconds, say,<br/>then 450 messages would take getting on for four hours.</p><p>Maybe more - e.g. if my ISP disconnects (as it can) and I have<br/>to reconnect.</p><p>I could warn you about it in advance, and we could all switch to no<br/>e-mail mode, (or get Jeff to do it for us) while it happened.</p><p>However, that seems an awkward solution.</p><p>A better idea, if we want to do this, might be to do it the other<br/>way round - I&apos;d ask Jeff to make another group, say, new_crazy_music<br/>then before anyone joins it, I&apos;d forward all the posts from PMG to<br/>it.</p><p>When that was all done, I&apos;d let you know, and then Jeff can rename<br/>crazy_music to crazy_music_was, and then rename the new_crazy_music<br/>to crazy_music.</p><p>Then we all rejoin crazy_music.</p><p>Then finally, I can repost all the messages from crazy_music_was to<br/>crazy_music, and there we are, all the posts from PMG in<br/>chronological order, followed by the ones from crazy_music.</p><p>Anyway, no idea whether this the thing to do, it&apos;s something to<br/>discuss, but it may be of interest to know that it can be done if<br/>we do decide on  it.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=31 href="#31">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>5/31/2001 10:20:02 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>SOunds good to me.

It can be done,<br/>but there is rather more involved than one would expect, as Windows CE<br/>(which is used for Palm tops) is a cut down version of Windows, which<br/>doesn&apos;t have all the features, so one needs work arounds for that.</p><p>Also, the programming environment is similar, but not completely<br/>identical, mainly, the handling of text isn&apos;t quite the same,<br/>and a couple of graphics routines (one is to draw a line) are missing.</p><p>So, I&apos;ll keep it in mind, but as there is quite a lot involved, doesn&apos;t<br/>look like something I&apos;ll do in the near future. Unfortunately, isn&apos;t<br/>just a matter of re-building it for Windows CE; at least some rewriting<br/>of the code would also be needed.</p><p>Maybe some day I&apos;ll get the Windows CE compiler, and experiment with some<br/>smaller programs first, that would be the way to do it if one wanted<br/>to get this going. However, I can&apos;t see it happening in the immediate<br/>future.</p><p>Sorry about that, and thanks for the suggestion!</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=67 href="#67">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/1/2001 8:17:55 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi there,</p><p>Maybe a solution that would please everyone would be to repost<br/>all the messages in all the PM digests except the last two?</p><p>Or make archive of the same.</p><p>Would need permission to repost of course for all the original<br/>posters.
