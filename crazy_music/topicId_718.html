This means that an<br/>infected file could be stored there as a backup file, and VirusScan<br/>will be unable to delete these files. These instructions explain how<br/>to remove the infected files from the C:\_Restore folder.</p><p>Disabling the Restore Utility</p><p>1. Right click the My Computer icon on the Desktop.<br/>2. Click on the Performance Tab.<br/>3. Click on the File System button.<br/>4. Click on the Troubleshooting Tab.<br/>5. Put a check mark next to &quot;Disable System Restore&quot;.<br/>6. Click the Apply button.<br/>7. Click the Close button.<br/>8. Click the Close button again.<br/>9. You will be prompted to restart the computer. Click Yes.<br/>NOTE: The Restore Utility will now be disabled.<br/>10. Restart the computer in Safe Mode.<br/>11. Run a scan with VirusScan to delete all infected files, or browse<br/>the file&apos;s located in the C:\_Restore folder and remove the file&apos;s.<br/>12. After removing the desired files, restart the computer normally.<br/>NOTE: To re-enable the Restore Utility, follow steps 1-9 and on step<br/>5 remove the check mark next to &quot;Disable System Restore&quot;. The<br/>infected file&apos;s are removed and the System Restore is once again<br/>active.</p><p>Registry Entries:<br/>The W32/SirCam@M... virus makes changes to the registry.</p><p>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\<br/>RunServices\Driver32=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\SCam32.exe</p><p>HKLM\Software\Sircam</p><p>In Infected state: HKCR\exefile\shell\open\command<br/>\Default=&quot;C:\recycled\SirC32.exe&quot; &quot;%1&quot;%*</p><p>In Clean state this should be: HKCR\exefile\shell\open\command<br/>\Default=&quot;&quot;%1&quot;%*&quot;</p><p>Note that manual modification of registry items is dangerous and<br/>should not be needed at all as VirusScan will clean all the registry<br/>items automatically.</p></div><h3>jpehrson@...</h3><span>7/26/2001 9:27:14 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., Lawrence  Ball &lt;Lawrenceball@p...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/718">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/718</a></p><p>Yes, I received this virus as well.
