(Reuters) - Townspeople and weather<br/>experts were scratching their heads in puzzlement after<br/>large quantities of corn husks fell from the skies on<br/>Wichita, Kansas, over the weekend.</p><p>According to news reports, thousands of foot-long and<br/>larger leaves from corn stalks fell like rain across<br/>the eastern edge of this south-central Kansas city on<br/>Saturday and Sunday.</p><p>&grave;&grave;It was a pretty large area where people reported<br/>it,&apos;&apos; said Weather Data Inc. meteorologist Chad<br/>Pettera. &grave;&grave;I think it is very odd.&apos;&apos;</p><p>Pettera said that in cases of high winds, tornadoes,<br/>thunderstorms and other extreme weather events it was<br/>not unusual for objects to fall from the sky after<br/>getting blown long distances.</p><p>But there has been no unusual weather to explain the<br/>falling corn husks, he said.</p><p>&grave;&grave;In our area there has been no weather to speak of, no<br/>high winds. It&apos;s just been very hot and dry&apos;&apos; he said.<br/>Some speculated that an airplane may somehow have been<br/>responsible, but there is no evidence to back up the<br/>theory.</p><p>&grave;&grave;There weren&apos;t strong winds. I don&apos;t see how they<br/>could have gotten blown up in the air,&apos;&apos; National<br/>Weather Service meteorological technician Holly<br/>Kreutzer told a local newspaper.</p><p>Kansas is known as the largest wheat producing state in<br/>the United States, but also grows a significant amount<br/>of corn each summer.</p></div>
