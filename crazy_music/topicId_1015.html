What Processing!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; _________ _________ ________<br/>&gt; &gt; Joseph Pehrson<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks Joseph!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You mean Joseph Conrad&apos;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;? Good book. BTW -<br/>heard<br/>&gt; they&apos;ve just re-released an updated version of Apocalypse Now,<br/>which<br/>&gt; was based on HoD. Supposed to have new scenes and new color<br/>&gt; processing.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The processing on this one was interesting and a bit challenging. I<br/>&gt; had to essentially use digital EQ as a &quot;Band Pass Filter&quot;.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For those who may not be familiar with this term, it is one of four<br/>&gt; general kinds of filters that you will find on many modern (and<br/>&gt; usually old analogs) synths:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.    Low Pass: Lets only frequencies below the cutoff pass through.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 2.    High Pass: Lets only frequencies above the cutoff pass<br/>through.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 3.    Band Pass: Lets you specify a range in the middle to pass<br/>&gt; through.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 4.    Notch: Lets you cut frequencies from the middle, and pass the<br/>&gt; outsides.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On Jeff&apos;s recording, I used the EQ to remove everything below about<br/>&gt; 1,000 hz - that was the easy part. But I also wanted to attenuate<br/>the<br/>&gt; frequencies which were in the range of the crickets (above the<br/>&gt; frogs), thus putting the focus on the range of frequencies that the<br/>&gt; sound of the frogs occupied. For this end of the frequency range I<br/>&gt; created a slope from about 2500 hz down to around 12,000 hz. This<br/>&gt; nicely softened the highs of the crickets. Next I went through a<br/>&gt; similar procedure as I explained to Robert for the rest of the<br/>piece.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; JL</p><p>Thanks, Jacky... as a &quot;beginning&quot; digital EQ user, I appreciate these<br/>tips!</p><p>__________ ____________ ________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
