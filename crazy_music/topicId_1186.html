Should we care if they listen?<br/>Milton Babbitt&apos;s famous article &quot;Should We Care if They Listen?&quot;<br/>published<br/>in Perspectives of New Music in 19? was reputedly given that title<br/>not by<br/>him but by his sharp-eared editor. The title speaks volumes about how<br/>listeners and composers of &quot;academic music&quot;--that peculiarly American<br/>construct--relate to each other. To ask, &quot;Who cares if you listen,&quot;<br/>is to<br/>open and peer inside the forbidden closet. The skeleton inside has<br/>twelve<br/>ribs. Run a mallet down them to hear the sound of 20th century<br/>academic<br/>music in the USA.<br/>The university is only one possible part of town where we could make<br/>new<br/>music, but for the most part we tend to stay among our own. We have<br/>these<br/>quaint academic meetings that we call recitals. How do they fit in<br/>the whole<br/>music scene? How does playing in and going to recitals help us know<br/>how to<br/>play or listen to the music of our own place and time? And when do we<br/>stop<br/>going to meetings and start living our real lives, start making our<br/>real<br/>music?<br/>Confining our view to the USA for the moment, we appear to live in a<br/>tiny<br/>subculture where composer-professors write music that most of<br/>humanity can<br/>not understand a word of. Putting ourselves in the place of the non-<br/>elect<br/>(or remembering the days when we ourselves were among the non-elect),<br/>we see<br/>a strange sight, that of music which is not written for the way it<br/>will<br/>sound but for the sake of structural goals. I remember a time years<br/>ago when<br/>one hexachord sounded almost indistinguishable from another, and a<br/>Schoenberg piece would have sounded much the same forward as<br/>backward. (I am<br/>not really sure I can tell the difference now; I&apos;m afraid to run the<br/>experiment). Writing music from the point of view of structure, and<br/>then<br/>expecting an audience to train itself to like the way it sounds--puts<br/>the<br/>cart before the horse.<br/>One possible reply is that hearing occurs inside the brain of the<br/>listener,<br/>so there is no such thing as writing music for how it sounds in the<br/>absolute, only how it would sound to an individual. The only thing the<br/>composer can do with integrity is to write for her own ears alone,<br/>and hope<br/>that the work will resonate inside other ears as well. To do<br/>differently<br/>would mean changing oneself into somebody else, which Westerners<br/>consider a<br/>violation of that all-important integrity.<br/>Another answer is to enlarge the scope of discussion to include<br/>Europe. Our<br/>subculture did not spring into existence by itself. The names we<br/>invoke,<br/>Stockhausen, Boulez, Xenakis, and all their predecessors, grew up<br/>thinking<br/>of themselves as continuing the great tradition of European art<br/>music, as do<br/>their disciples in turn. And over there, there is an audience, not<br/>very<br/>large perhaps, but enough to keep the ball in play.<br/>At bottom, though, we write this difficult music because we have no<br/>real<br/>choice. Do we stop making music? Dumb our music down? No, we are<br/>stuck being<br/>who we are. That is perhaps the common situation of all artists:<br/>being stuck<br/>who you are, deriving artistic energy from the ever-changing but<br/>never-to-be-resolved conflicts and making beauty come out of them. The<br/>peculiar thing is that we are trying to do this in a university<br/>setting,<br/>with its emphasis on rationality and explanation and cross-<br/>referencing and<br/>argument-making.<br/>The audience<br/>So we find a central contradiction between what we musicians need our<br/>musical languages to express and what our potential audience can<br/>hear. Our<br/>attempts to deny or ignore the contradiction having failed, we next<br/>search<br/>for ways to resolve it. Perhaps the audience is wrong, and perhaps we<br/>can<br/>either educate it better or treat it better, or perhaps we can<br/>conclude that<br/>we are simply right and they are wrong, that we can merely<br/>repeat, &quot;who<br/>cares if you listen?&quot;<br/>The &quot;better education&quot; idea appeals to us academics, and indeed it is<br/>worth<br/>pursuing. Excellent writers such as Brendel and Griffiths champion<br/>Carter in<br/>much the same language as they discuss Beethoven in the pages of<br/>general<br/>readership periodicals. They argue passionately against the program<br/>directors&apos; natural impulse, when there is no alternative than to<br/>program<br/>&quot;new music,&quot; to choose safe, easy-listening, neo-tonal music over<br/>what is<br/>difficult but worthwhile. The fight is uphill, but that does not make<br/>it<br/>less worthy.<br/>Treating the audience better might help too. Sitting in a concert<br/>seat is<br/>not comfortable [1] and much of our potential audience might be<br/>staying home<br/>simply because they do not enjoy concerts very much. Of course you<br/>can not<br/>easily play Beethoven in a club setting, but that need not stop<br/>makers of<br/>new music from considering such an outlet. Just do not write for<br/>unamplified<br/>string quartet.<br/>The final solution of simply telling the audience to go away is<br/>wrongheaded.<br/>Taking the audience away causes the music to shrivel (and in turn,<br/>unenergetic music turns the audience further away.) Academic music in<br/>the<br/>USA is played in front of small audiences, and much the same people<br/>night<br/>after night. This is part of our problem.<br/>The language<br/>It is sometimes useful to think separately about the way music<br/>sounds, and<br/>the way it is constructed. This separation appears to be very real in<br/>twentieth century composed art music. Few composers would pretend<br/>that the<br/>way their music sounds is unimportant, but many seem to feel that<br/>structural<br/>integrity is just as important, perhaps more important. This leads us<br/>to the<br/>old and contentious question, whether and how the structure of a piece<br/>should be perceived by the listener. Although we can not resolve that<br/>issue<br/>here, it does seem that there are ways to perceive structural<br/>integrity that<br/>do not depend on the listener&apos;s conscious understanding of<br/>some &quot;system.&quot;<br/>With certain exceptions, it does seem that music should not display<br/>all its<br/>logic, that would lead only to tedium. To sound &quot;right&quot; without<br/>sounding<br/>pedantic depends on the ability to hide structure.<br/>But a composer&apos;s choice of musical language must obey a second<br/>constraint as<br/>well, which is that it must empower the composer to write the music<br/>in the<br/>first place. We instill the need for structures to write within early<br/>in a<br/>music student&apos;s career. The craft of getting the notes to work out<br/>according<br/>to the rules is taught to young composers in &quot;writing and analysis&quot;<br/>courses<br/>which trace the development of our classical music heritage as if our<br/>music<br/>were a great march forward toward ever higher levels of skill and<br/>complexity. As I have argued elsewhere [2], the process of Western<br/>art music<br/>composition requires a system of complex, interlocking rules. Without<br/>the<br/>rules to push against, there is no way to expend effort; either the<br/>ink will<br/>not flow or else it pours out and covers the page. Put differently,<br/>the<br/>rules are an essential kind of mental chewing gum, without which the<br/>composer can not walk.<br/>Musical movements such as the Spectral school or the New Complexity<br/>fill<br/>this need. Music which is founded on rationalistic grounds can not<br/>achieve<br/>the all-important quality of ineffability until the wheels and cogs<br/>of the<br/>machinery become so complex that they can no longer be fully<br/>comprehended by<br/>the composer. As our technical standards rise ever higher, the music<br/>becomes<br/>ever more complicated. How much longer can this continue?<br/>Hidden Assumptions<br/>Although our music is complex to the point that few people can listen<br/>to it,<br/>we certainly do not offer the world&apos;s most complex music, merely the<br/>world&apos;s<br/>most unlistenable music. To compare our music to that of north India<br/>by<br/>asking which is the more complex is simply ludicrous. However, ours<br/>somehow<br/>sounds too complex. This may lie more in qualitative aspects of our<br/>music<br/>than quantitative ones; we might have a different kind of complexity<br/>(or<br/>perhaps it&apos;s just plain obfuscation) from that of other musics [3].<br/>The<br/>West&apos;s skill in classifying, combining, dissecting, structuring, and<br/>constructing has led us to world leadership in manufacturing, medical<br/>procedures, and electronic circuit design; yet our own population<br/>turns to a<br/>music which derives more strongly from the African diaspora than from<br/>our<br/>&quot;own&quot; musical culture.<br/>2. Composition and music scholarship<br/>The composer is the central cult figure in our twentieth century art<br/>music.<br/>This development has been long in coming (composers such as Beethoven<br/>and<br/>Wagner come to mind) but the dominance of the composer has only now<br/>reached<br/>its logical extreme in the U.S. university scene. This dominance both<br/>derives from and contributes to the bookishness of university<br/>composers.<br/>Universities are about bookishness, not music. The token at the end<br/>of the<br/>tunnel, the Ph.D. dissertation, is essentially a book. In general,<br/>artists<br/>are not awarded Ph.D. degrees, although art historians or theorists<br/>are;<br/>their output is not works of art but scholarly prose. Somehow,<br/>though, the<br/>idea became accepted that a large-scale written score, a piece of<br/>Western<br/>art music, could qualify as a dissertation, and that therefore the<br/>correct<br/>university degree to award a composer would be the Doctorate of<br/>Philosophy.<br/>This places certain expectations on music of the university genre. To<br/>start<br/>with, the music must be written down. Many musics are written down<br/>but many<br/>others are not. The former can get you a Ph.D. in itself; whereas to<br/>specialize in the latter you will have to find something to write<br/>down in<br/>the music&apos;s place. The need to write about unwritable music is<br/>answered by<br/>the academic field of ethnomusicology.<br/>Second, the book you have to write to gain entry to the university<br/>must have<br/>a linear structure. Music as it is performed has little choice but to<br/>start<br/>at the beginning, proceed to the end, then stop. But there may be<br/>many other<br/>ways of thinking about it, and we may be neglecting nonlinear<br/>approaches to<br/>musical invention because we think of writing music as being like<br/>writing a<br/>book.<br/>Third, scholarly books are rational, measurable, ponderable,<br/>evaluable.<br/>Music may or may not enjoy these qualities. To insist on them, as the<br/>university has taught composers to do, is to choose one music over<br/>perhaps<br/>many others.<br/>Finally, an even more basic assumption is favored by the academic<br/>music<br/>mill, which is that music should live on a two-dimensional grid with<br/>discretized time and pitch for axes [4]. Pitch runs twelve units to<br/>the<br/>octave and time is divided in measures which hold between one and<br/>sixteen<br/>beats, occasionally with a half beat added. On this grid the music is<br/>divided into objects called notes. You can hear all the notes in a<br/>piece of<br/>music and there is never any question whether some sound you are<br/>hearing is<br/>one note or a superposition of many simpler ones. The note is the<br/>indivisible atom of music.<br/>These are the traits of a written language. Our culture, which begins<br/>with<br/>the sentence, &quot;In the beginning was the word,&quot; has found a way to<br/>reduce<br/>music to a form of writing. Music might serve to declare something,<br/>or might<br/>ask an answerable question. Music could even present an enigmatic,<br/>meaningless poem. But music always has to speak in some language.<br/>Priests<br/>If composition is a form of writing, the composer is the literate<br/>priest in<br/>a countryside populated by illiterate peasants. The priesthood is<br/>charged<br/>with the vital responsibility of keeping the written culture alive.<br/>Music<br/>scholars are the monks who help by copying and sometimes illuminating<br/>the<br/>precious manuscripts.<br/>In the old days this made sense. If we wish to have a system of music<br/>making<br/>that emphasizes continuity, so that every church across the land can<br/>sing<br/>the same hymns on the same holidays, the written score is the ideal<br/>solution. If our musical culture is carried forth by putting on<br/>concerts<br/>where a dozen or more musicians are expected to play together, the<br/>only<br/>practical solution is the written score. Finally, we turn to written<br/>scores<br/>when the complexity of our music exceeds the capacity of an oral<br/>tradition<br/>to learn it by heart.<br/>But the twin technologies of amplification and recording change<br/>entirely the<br/>economics of music performance. Two or three musicians can make as<br/>much<br/>noise as an orchestra; and there&apos;s little danger of forgetting music<br/>now<br/>that we can routinely press a CD with the night&apos;s work. Of course we<br/>would<br/>prefer to be able to have the dozens of musicians, and if we did have<br/>them<br/>we would want to play from a written score, but writing the score out<br/>hardly<br/>causes the musicians to appear, so if you are thinking about a club-<br/>sized<br/>ensemble you might not have a strong reason to prefer to have the<br/>music be<br/>written.<br/>In contrast to priests who are in the employ of their parishes,<br/>composers<br/>are paid by the performers who commission them. A group of sixty<br/>musicians<br/>is in a better position to employ a composer than a trio. The<br/>musicians hire<br/>the composer to instruct them how to behave, in much the same way as<br/>students pay professors to direct them.<br/>Since it&apos;s the musicians who are paying, perhaps the composer could<br/>be used<br/>in a fashion that is more relevant to the situation. Although the<br/>commissioning musician asks the composer for a score, it is not the<br/>musician&apos;s primary goal that the score be left around after the<br/>performance<br/>as some sort of memento. That, on the other hand, is the composer&apos;s<br/>primary<br/>goal; the money helps him keep body and soul together for another few<br/>months, but it is the paper the composer truly cares about. The<br/>musician<br/>views the score as a byproduct that other musicians can later<br/>scavenge, if<br/>they wish, as a cheaper option than to go out and commission some<br/>other<br/>composer&apos;s piece.<br/>If we are going to pay them, we can tell composers to do what we<br/>want, and<br/>that can involve writing specific sequences of pitches and times or<br/>not, as<br/>the situation requires. The composer&apos;s role in the creation of new<br/>music<br/>could be vastly more variable--and more interesting--than that of a<br/>priest.<br/>Nurturing our composers in the university, as we do in the USA, has<br/>worked<br/>negatively on our music. The harried, flustered composition<br/>professors are<br/>under pressure to keep proving themselves worthy of keeping the<br/>academic<br/>flame, competing with scholars on grounds of rationality, linearity,<br/>and<br/>alphabetizability. This has had an almost irresistibly corrupting<br/>influence<br/>on our music. A hopeful development is the emergence of younger<br/>university<br/>composers who are able to question the structures of the<br/>composer/performer/audience food chain [5]. Since the limitations of<br/>our<br/>musical language seem to derive in part from the university reward<br/>structure, courage will be needed to break free of them. As always,<br/>the<br/>breakthroughs will come only at the cost of having to break rules.<br/>3. Music in the University<br/>Academic publishing, the ritual of getting scores and scholarly<br/>papers into<br/>the journals or published as monographs by the academic presses, is a<br/>classic pyramid scheme. An academic researcher might read 100 papers<br/>for<br/>each paper he writes for publication, but an academic journal cannot<br/>survive<br/>with fewer than a thousand subscriptions.<br/>In preparing our students for an academic career, we are buying them<br/>in to a<br/>parallel pyramid scheme. At UCSD, for example, we have 23 music<br/>faculty (so<br/>we hire one per year on average, say) and in a typical year we<br/>graduate six<br/>or eight new music doctors. Will there be jobs? Only if the university<br/>population expands by a factor of six every generation. This is<br/>linked to<br/>the publishing pyramid scheme. Tenure cases hinge on getting articles<br/>printed in the good journals. If there are not enough people to read<br/>the<br/>journals, who will find it profitable to print them, and if they are<br/>not<br/>printed, how will our tenure track professors get their writings<br/>published?<br/>So from the point of view of dissemination of scores and other<br/>writings, the<br/>university seems unsuitable as a home for music makers. Living in the<br/>university and writing for (and playing to) an audience of out fellow<br/>university lodgers can be seen perhaps as a preparation for something<br/>to<br/>follow, but certainly not as an end. Music -- and writings about<br/>music --<br/>must reach outward.<br/>On the other hand, the university is the best place for musical<br/>exploration<br/>and collaboration. It is also the best monastery we have now for<br/>retreating<br/>from the world of moneymaking to the world of music-making. The last<br/>thing<br/>we should imagine doing upon leaving the university should be to take<br/>up a<br/>teaching post in some other university. The university has a deeply<br/>valuable<br/>thing to offer musicians, which is a chance to think in a serious and<br/>unhurried way about their music. The state of &quot;art music&quot; suggests<br/>that the<br/>time for such thinking is at hand.<br/>In most university programs we work to acquire language. The language<br/>is<br/>always a shared one; chemists talk orbitals, physicists spinors,<br/>linguists<br/>verbs, artists pigments, and philosophers stones. But in music each<br/>composer<br/>speaks her own. Whether or not this plurality of language is a good<br/>thing<br/>for music, the university has been an opposing force, pushing music<br/>toward a<br/>common language which it naturally shrinks from, that of the twelve<br/>tones.<br/>This language may soon be a dead one.<br/>It is tempting to try to cook up a new musical paradigm. Perhaps<br/>there is a<br/>way to construct music which is at once tonal (so that we can hear the<br/>result) but at the same time combinatorially intractable so that the<br/>rationalistic composer can have something to bite down on. Here we<br/>have<br/>argued that perhaps the answer will not be some new compositional<br/>paradigm<br/>ala 12-tone, but rather the question will be mooted by a larger<br/>phenomenon,<br/>which is the shifting role of the composer. From this point of view,<br/>the 12<br/>tone system appears to be a mere aberration brought on by our<br/>insistence on<br/>sticking with the composer/paper/musician model long after it became<br/>unviable.<br/>Notes<br/>1.
