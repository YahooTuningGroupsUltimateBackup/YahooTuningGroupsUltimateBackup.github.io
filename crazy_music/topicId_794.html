I have some random CDs of music from Bali and percussion<br/>music from some &quot;Island people&quot;. I&apos;d love to have some recommendations<br/>displaying the concepts you mentioned (quasi-ET not approximating JI,<br/>modulation, addition of &apos;semitones&apos; to create something more like<br/>constant structures).</p><p>On a similar note, I was listenning to some Thai music and trying to<br/>duplicate its tunings. It certainly did not seem like 7tet since the fifth<br/>was very good. I tried a neutral scale in 31</p><p>4554445 (a non-MOS variation on 4545445)</p><p>which seemed to &apos;crumple&apos; all the notes in the right places but I<br/>was unable to produce the vibe I was hearing. What are the cents values<br/>or names in the Scala archive of scales that may be close approximations?</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
