EXAMPLE: &quot;What tuning did<br/>Bach use?&quot; EXAMPLE: &quot;Schoenberg<br/>actually meant (fill in the blank)!&quot;</p><p>    [6] Claims about the human ear/brain<br/>system not backed up by detailed citations<br/>from the scientific literature, preferably<br/>also backed up by specific microtonal musical<br/>examples.</p><p>    [7] Arguments about abstractions like<br/>alleged properties of the human brain as<br/>they supposedly relate to microtonal tunings.<br/>(Technically this is a variant of 5, but<br/>proves such a common waste of time on-line<br/>that it deserves its own special concentric<br/>inner circle in Dante&apos;s hell.)</p><p>    [8] Efforts to rehabilitate debunked<br/>18th and 19th century musical superstitions. EXAMPLE:<br/>&quot;The chord of nature is the basis of music,&quot;<br/>&quot;Harmony forms the foundation of Western music,&quot;<br/>&quot;Listeners prefer 5-limit JI version of classic<br/>Western compositions,&quot; &quot;The acoustical smoothness<br/>of intervals plays a fundamental role in music,&quot;<br/>&quot;Mathematics is the basis of music,&quot; &quot;Acoustics<br/>determines our musical responses,&quot; ad nauseum.<br/>    Modern studies of non-Western music have shown<br/>that the vast majority of musical cultures throughout<br/>the world do not adhere to these beliefs and do<br/>not create music based on these peculiarly Western<br/>superstititons.</p><p>    [9] Trying to use the psychoacoustics of<br/>isolated musical intervals to learn something<br/>musically meaningful about microtonal music.</p><p>    [10] Arguing about microtonal scales as<br/>abstractions rather than embodied in specific<br/>particular musical compositions.</p><p>    [11] Arguments about the definition of<br/>words or activities. EXAMPLE: Arguing over<br/>what &quot;the scientific method&quot; is, or what<br/>&quot;dissonance&quot; means. This is useless because,<br/>as Justice Potter Stewart said about pornography,<br/>&quot;I can&apos;t define it, but I know it when I see it.&quot;</p><p>    [12] Arguments about what allegedly does or<br/>allegedly does not constitute some kind of<br/>specific activity. EXAMPLE: &quot;But 3-limit is/is not<br/>really JI!!!!&quot; EXAMPLE: &quot;Jazz does/does not fit<br/>the definition of microtonal music!!!&quot;<br/>(Technically a variant of 11 above, but<br/>this kind of meaningless haggling has<br/>wasted so much time on-line that it also<br/>deserves its own special concentric circle<br/>in Dante&apos;s hell.)</p><p>   [13] Squabbling about the kinds of harmonies<br/>which are or are not available in various microtonal<br/>tunings.  This proves useless since melody proves<br/>vastly more important in music than harmony.<br/>---------<br/>   Related to productive activities, productive<br/>vs. unproductive attitudes:</p><p>PRODUCTIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD MICROTONALITY</p><p>   [1] Each intonation has its own unique<br/>       musical uses</p><p>   [2] Each timbre/tuning combination allows<br/>       remarkable musical possibilities</p><p>   [3] Each type of electronic or acoustic<br/>       instruments offers vivid and musically<br/>       memorable options for the xenharmonic<br/>       composer</p><p>   [4] &quot;I&apos;m going to learn about microtonality<br/>       by composing microtonal music&quot;</p><p>   [5] Western history involves a fluctuating<br/>       melee of musical styles from which the<br/>       contemporary xenahrmonic composer can<br/>       usefully draw</p><p>   [6]  World music offers a smorgasboard of<br/>        potentially useful musical approaches</p><p>   [7]  Psychouacoustics and congitive psych<br/>        and other scientific disciplines offer<br/>        potentially valuable info on general<br/>        limits of possible musical strategies,<br/>        but CANNOT by themselves determine<br/>        musically meaningful elements of<br/>        of compositional style</p><p>   [8]   When composing microtonal music,<br/>         Western preconceptions must often<br/>         be tossed into the dumpster</p><p>UNPRODUCTIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD MICROTONALITY:</p><p>    [1]  There exist good and bad musical scales,<br/>         and our main business is to discover which<br/>         is which</p><p>   [2]   Some timbre/tuning combinations are good<br/>         while others are bad, and we must discover<br/>         which is which</p><p>   [3]   Some types of electronic (or acoustic)<br/>         instruments are good for microtonal<br/>         music while others are bad, and we must<br/>         search out and identify them.</p><p>   [4] &quot;I&apos;m going to learn about microtonality<br/>       by yakking [or surfing] on the internet<br/>       without composing music&quot;</p><p>   [5] &quot;I&apos;m going to learn about microtonality<br/>       by manipulating lists of numbers and<br/>       equations instead of composing xenharmonic<br/>       music&quot;</p><p>   [6] &quot;I&apos;m going to learn about microtonality<br/>       by sitting at the feet of some (preferably<br/>       dead) guru like Partch or Helmholtz and<br/>       following his unsubstantiated claims about<br/>       music to the letter, rather than by composing<br/>       xenharmonic music&quot;</p><p>   [7] Western history is a ramp which, with a<br/>       majestic historical inevitability, rises<br/>       inexorably with the force of history toward<br/>       [fill in the blank: 5-limit JI, atonal modernist<br/>        music, or whatever].</p><p>   [8]  &quot;World music is based on the pure perfect<br/>        chord of nature which those ignorant<br/>        jungle bunnies are simply too inept to<br/>        produce accurately&quot;</p><p>   [9]  Psychoacoustics [or cognitive psych or<br/>        acoustics] or other scientific disciplines offer<br/>        guidelines for composing actual music,<br/>        since as we all know musical styles never<br/>        change over time and cultural attitudes play<br/>        no role in our perception of musical<br/>        melodies or intervals or compositions.</p><p>   [10]   When composing microtonal music,<br/>         we must start with Pythagorean Western<br/>         musical prejudices and force-fit all<br/>         microtonal tunings into those prejudices,<br/>         ignoring and/or denigrating any tuning<br/>         or microtonal compositional practice<br/>         which resists such Procrustean mutilation.</p><p>---------<br/>--mclaren</p></div><h3><a id=894 href="#894">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>8/5/2001 4:54:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., xed@e... wrote:</p><p><a href="/crazy_music/topicId_882.html#882">/crazy_music/topicId_882.html#882</a></p><p>&gt; FROM: mclaren<br/>&gt; TO: The New Alternative Wanking List<br/>&gt; SUBJECT: Productive and unproductive activities<br/>&gt;</p><p>This seemed like a valuable post for composers...</p><p>________ ______ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
