I never tried<br/>any musical application. Brian, have you used wavelets for sound<br/>analysis yet? It would be interesting to see how they do, since you<br/>can custom design your set of wavelets to the signal you want to<br/>analyze.&quot;</p><p>   Alas, John, this points up a truly grotesque aspect of today&apos;s modern world...namely, the obscenely high price of mathematical software.<br/>   At last quote, Matlab cost somewhere above $2100.00.  That&apos;s not &quot;two hundred and ten dollars,&quot; or &quot;twenty one dollars.&quot;  That&apos;s &quot;Two thousand one hundred dollars.&quot;  Mathematica costs slightly less, if memory serves around $1900.00.</p><p>     Jeff Scott and I have discussed the lamentable tendency for folks to pirate software and not give the creators of the software any cash for their years of hard work. I&apos;m still against pirating software, and people should not be reluctant to pay a reasonable amount (up to a couple of hundred bucks) for a piece of quality software.</p><p>      However, there quickly comes a point when the price of software leaves the range we can call reasonable and enters into the realm of the grotesquely obscene.  Both Matlab and Mathematica, with their outrageously stratospheric prices, left the &quot;reasonable&quot; range a long long long time ago.</p><p>       This is tremendously sad.  Does it occur to anyone that one of hte great problems in our modern technological society is lack of mathematical competence?  Indeed, simple innumeracy and general fear of mathematics characterizes American culture -- for example. Ronald Reagan was outraged and deeply appalled when he was told that a full 50% of the students who took SATs got below average scores.  :-)<br/>     (Yeah, I said I never use emoticons, but every rule has its exceptions.)</p><p>      In our hi-tech modern world, the most crying need we have is for mathematically literate technically competent students.  Now, you&apos;d THINK that onbe of the best ways to encourage folks not to fear math would be to make sophisticated mathematical programs like Matlab and Mathematica as *cheap* as possible.<br/>      Instead, the message that Stephen Wolfram and his greed-crazed cronies are sending to young  Americans is:  &quot;Don&apos;t even THINK about doing math on a computer.  You can&apos;t even come CLOSE to affording it!  KIss off math!  Forget about doing it the easy way, by programming statements in Matlab or Mathematica, and by watching raphs drawn before your eyes.  You must struggle and suffer with a calculator FOREVER.  Mathematical software is priced out of your reach because it is only for the elite few, the rich, the wealthy microscopic upper-crust with money to burn!&quot;</p><p>     Boy, if that isn&apos;t the WRONG message to send young Americans, I don&apos;t know what is.  If our society wants to discourage young folks from taking up mathematics or the sciences, pricing these mathematical programs in the stratosphere the way they are is the very best way to do it.</p><p>     Incidentally, a lolt of folks have contacted me about implementing William Sethares&apos;  spectral matching ideas in music.  Sadly, Bill works in Matlab...and guess what?  All these earnest imaginative young musicans are priced right out of the game.  They take one look at the two thousand dollar price tag on Matlab and shake their heads and walk away in disgust.<br/>--------------<br/>--mclaren</p></div><h3><a id=1067 href="#1067">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/28/2001 7:46:01 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., xed@e... wrote:<br/>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    Alas, John, this points up a truly grotesque aspect of today&apos;s<br/>modern world...namely, the obscenely high price of mathematical<br/>software.<br/>&gt;    At last quote, Matlab cost somewhere above $2100.00.
