In other words, deLaubenfels&apos;<br/>&gt; computer program *only* seems to give valid output<br/>&gt; when the composition fed in is one which does not<br/>&gt; present obvious problems for 5-limit retuning. But<br/>&gt; of course this so greatly restricts the possible<br/>&gt; range of musical samples that the very operation of<br/>&gt; deLaubenfels&apos; adaptive retuning programs prevents<br/>&gt; itself from being seriously tested with a reasonable<br/>&gt; range of musical materials.</p><p>I don&apos;t think the program is actually *designed* to resist<br/>falsification, but is, rather, limited in the range of music that it<br/>can effectively retune by virtue of its goals: to retune music<br/>conceived as sectionally diatonic to as close to small number ratios<br/>as possible, and to distribute the commas in such a way as to fool the<br/>ear into thinking there were no comma shifts. I actually preferred the<br/>older version where the comma shifts were in your face, and the<br/>intervals rang (in the Barbershop sense) more.</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;<br/>&gt; ---------<br/>&gt; --mclaren</p></div>
