I<br/>also think that someday we will find sound receptors on every cell,<br/>not just specialized sensory neurons. I know I am &quot;on the edge&quot; with<br/>these theories, and that sometimes I fall off :-) Nonetheless my own<br/>experience is that far more is going on energetically with human<br/>bodies than science can currently explain, so I continue looking for<br/>connections in weird places.</p><p>I am planning on El Paso and looking forward to meeting people in the<br/>flesh.</p><p>peace<br/>Mary</p></div>
