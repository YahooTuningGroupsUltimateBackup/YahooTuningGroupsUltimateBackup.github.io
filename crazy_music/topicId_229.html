For instance<br/>look at the 5 tone scales form a 7 tone master set. Having worked in 31<br/>the MOS are great. If one looks at 12 ET there are reasons that 5 and 7<br/>tones MOS scales work best because you can transpose your melodic ideas<br/>and the intervals will only change within a certain range, usually where<br/>no motific interval will transgress the intervals of larger and smaller<br/>neighbors. For instance if we take C E F G in a major scale which is<br/>like ascending 2 steps, one step, one step, the two step interval will<br/>always be larger than any of the one step intervals. etc. Now if we<br/>applied the same type of transposition  to a 6 , 8 , or 9 tone scales we<br/>would come up with all types of abnormalities that make the motif much<br/>harder to recognize. Anyways one has merely to try it out to realize<br/>why  6 tones scales just never caught on. It seems when  people make<br/>scales they like them to be cyclical. Even with ETs, no one complains<br/>that we are omitted all type of good scales by including all the steps.<br/>like 31 without the last step is as a good scale. True but more is<br/>gained by including it.<br/>    As for The Greek Aulos. Since no one has bothered to reconstruct<br/>these instruments they really don&apos;t know what they are talking about.<br/>Jim French being the only one has told me over and over again how well<br/>her data holds up. He will play them over the phone if you wish. True<br/>she was over Zealous about saying how far reaching these scales, but in<br/>Bali we do have Subharmonic flutes of equally spaced Holes. We also have<br/>flutes where the  holes are three equally spaced holes an unequal gap<br/>then 3 more equally spaces, deriving scales from two parts of the<br/>subharmonic series. Without her pioneering work, we would be further in<br/>the dark. Erv also have an extensive collection of subharmonic flutes<br/>from South america as well as eastern Europe. They are truly all around<br/>us. Also she mentions  scales from the subharmonic series not stopping<br/>at 13 but up into the 20&apos;s with no mention of any cap beyond which<br/>subharmonic ratios are not to be used<br/>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=240 href="#240">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>7/8/2001 2:21:03 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Everyone</p><p>Great to see this list playing again.  Rick I really enjoyed the<br/>Fairy Lullaby.  Do you want to talk about the technical details of<br/>working with the two singers.  In my experience aits not very<br/>difficult to sing &quot;alt&quot; tunings if there is a strong meldody line to<br/>follow.  On the other hand using a verifiable tuner like autotune<br/>with microtunings is opening my eyes, especially where I can see<br/>there are large cent (&gt; 33 cents) errors that don&apos;t sound so bad and<br/>smaller (&lt;18 cents) which are ouch.  I m not sure that I have<br/>Autotune working exactly as it is supposed to so I&apos;m not ready to<br/>share the examples, but I will... It certainly is refining what I<br/>hear.</p><p>Jacky a great piece.  Love the texture and richness and tension.  And<br/>Alison I am enjoying your alien production aenormously.</p><p>George be kind to your finger and your Psyche.  Glad nothing worse<br/>happened but nonetheless it must have been a shock.  When I get a bad<br/>teat or sprain in my body I like to see a healer as well as a<br/>traditional MD - the healer tends to get me feeling more comfortable<br/>and less traumatized, while the MD has an obvious role that is also<br/>important.</p><p>Mary</p></div><h3><a id=243 href="#243">ðŸ”—</a>rick@...</h3><span>7/8/2001 4:05:07 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Mary said...</p><p>&gt; Rick I really enjoyed the Fairy Lullaby.<br/>&gt; Do you want to talk about the technical details of<br/>&gt; working with the two singers.</p><p>Thanks.  Glad you enjoyed it.  Technically, there&apos;s nothing to tell, I<br/>guess.  I gave them each a CD with the accompaniment, which does have a<br/>strong melodic line.  They followed it and didn&apos;t notice anything out of the<br/>ordinary.  I&apos;m sure that stuff farther from the usual would be tougher...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
