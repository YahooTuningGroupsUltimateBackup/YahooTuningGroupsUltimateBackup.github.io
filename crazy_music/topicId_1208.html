Once you realize this, most of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the rest falls into place.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; too bad they didn&apos;t come from the same place as Sun Ra!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Kraig!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Boy, you got that right. I should have been more clear.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As far as I am personally aware, there are at least two<br/>&gt; &gt; species of space aliens. The evil rectal-probing &quot;greys&quot; and<br/>&gt; &gt; the tall angelic beings with the sublime instruments.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have a feeling that Sun Ra is associated in some way with<br/>&gt; &gt; the latter group, although he does not physically resemble<br/>&gt; &gt; them. It is possible he could be affilited with some third<br/>&gt; &gt; group.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; - Jeff<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ***I remember hearing a wonderful, wonderful concert/set by Sun Ra in<br/>&gt; DETROIT, of all places, when I was growing up as a teenager... just<br/>&gt; doesn&apos;t necessarily seem to be the place where one would encounter<br/>&gt; that...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; J.
