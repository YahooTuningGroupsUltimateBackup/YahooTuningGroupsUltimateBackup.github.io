As some of you know, my pieces are, apart from the<br/>improvisations, mostly pop type music running towards comedy. How I<br/>compose: something pops into my head, usually a vocal or instrumental<br/>line, and it grows longer and develops in my mind&apos;s ear until it is a<br/>whole piece, at which point I write it down as a lyric sheet with<br/>chord changes and any instrumental riffs that are important. About<br/>half the time the whole idea does not develop, so I write down the<br/>fragment and put it in my files. Sometimes I can come back and look<br/>at the fragment and finish it, sometimes not.&quot; -- John Starrett</p><p>   But John there is much more to say about what you do, alebit<br/>mayhap from a different perspective from mine.</p><p>   When you say &quot;something pops into [your] head,&quot; can you give<br/>more detail on that?  Do you start with a rhythm?  Do you start<br/>with a riff?  Do you start with a guitar fingering?  Do you start<br/>with a guitar chord change, or set of changes?</p><p>    For those of you not familiar, John Starrett is a person of<br/>stupefyingly vast talents -- as well as a physicist, John Starrett<br/>qualifies as an expert luthier as well as a virtuoso instrument<br/>desginer (the StarrBoard) and a virtuoso fretless bass player, also<br/>a xenharmonic guitarist.</p><p>     Now, John, your wealth of experience as a luthier as well as<br/>a fretless bassist gives you a unique perspective on microtonal<br/>composition. Could you say a few words about composing microtonal<br/>music using an instrument you yourself designed and built?  How about<br/>discussing briefly the issue of &quot;finding&quot; pitches on a fretless<br/>bass?</p><p>     As you wil have noticed, my very limited perspective (as<br/>discussed so superficially and so inadequately in my post on<br/>compositional methods) comes entirely from the narrow viewpoint of a<br/>keyboard player. As we all know, keyboards are not the alpha and<br/>omega of music, but a very minor and limited sideshow.  Many other<br/>people are bound to have very different (and valuable) perspectives<br/>on composing microtonal music from outside the tiny little demesne of<br/>the 7-white-5-black keyboard, and you are one of those folks.  How<br/>about it, John?<br/>---------<br/>--mclaren</p></div><h3><a id=928 href="#928">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/6/2001 8:47:13 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., xed@e... wrote:<br/>&gt; FROM: mclaren</p><p>&gt;    But John there is much more to say about what you do, alebit<br/>&gt; mayhap from a different perspective from mine.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    When you say &quot;something pops into [your] head,&quot; can you give<br/>&gt; more detail on that?

Do you start<br/>&gt; with a guitar chord change, or set of changes?</p><p>Usually, for the songs I end up finishing, the whole phrase pops into<br/>my head complete with words, melody accompanyment. Usually it is just<br/>the first line or couple of lines, but a couple of times it was the<br/>whole first verse. It is like having a song stuck in your head, but<br/>you haven&apos;t heard it before. Then I just listen to it go, and if I am<br/>lucky, more lines or verses will append themselves until there is<br/>enough to write down and finish. Sometimes I have written words but<br/>have no music, and a melody will come to me. When I hear a melody, it<br/>is usually with accompanyment.</p><p>A couple of songs were composed while sitting around playing for<br/>friends. I hardly ever compose this way, but one of them, The Cat Man,<br/>will be on my CD.</p><p>I have a number of songs that remain unfinished since I rely so<br/>heavily on my inspirational mode to get material. I have tried<br/>finishing many of these by actually sitting down and working on them<br/>like I have read real songwriters do, and it just does me no good. I<br/>have one really cool one I would love to finish (it&apos;s about 2/3 of a<br/>song) for my CD, but I just can&apos;t get it. I have probably worked 50 or<br/>more hours trying, singing it around the house, listening to it in my<br/>head, playing it on the piano, forcing Neil to play it with me, but<br/>nothing doing.</p><p>&gt;      Now, John, your wealth of experience as a luthier as well as<br/>&gt; a fretless bassist gives you a unique perspective on microtonal<br/>&gt; composition. Could you say a few words about composing microtonal<br/>&gt; music using an instrument you yourself designed and built?</p><p>Well, as I noted above, I very rarely am able to compose at an<br/>instrument, but when I have it is just by improvising and something<br/>cool coming out. One thing that is important, I think, is for the<br/>instrument to feel natural in my hands. If it is a struggle to play,<br/>or feels unfamiliar, I can&apos;t play much, and can&apos;t get in the groove.</p><p>&gt; How about discussing briefly the issue of &quot;finding&quot; pitches on a &gt;<br/>&gt; fretless bass?</p><p>That is very interesting. I don&apos;t have perfect pitch, and I have only<br/>moderate pitch memory. I can hold a pitch in mind for at most an hour,<br/>I guess, but when I am playing a fretless bass or guitar, if I only<br/>play one note, it can seem right or wrong. If it is wrong, I move a<br/>little in the richt direction till it is right. That is really<br/>strange. I suppose I have been hearing something unconciously, and the<br/>instrument is somehow out of tune with that piece.</p><p>When doing free pitch improvisation, it is mostly physical feel, not<br/>pitch that guides me. My hands know what they want to do, and if it<br/>feels right in my hands, it sounds right to my ear.</p><p>&gt;      As you wil have noticed, my very limited perspective (as<br/>&gt; discussed so superficially and so inadequately in my post on<br/>&gt; compositional methods) comes entirely from the narrow viewpoint of a<br/>&gt; keyboard player. As we all know, keyboards are not the alpha and<br/>&gt; omega of music, but a very minor and limited sideshow.  Many other<br/>&gt; people are bound to have very different (and valuable) perspectives<br/>&gt; on composing microtonal music from outside the tiny little demesne<br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; the 7-white-5-black keyboard, and you are one of those folks.  How<br/>&gt; about it, John?<br/>&gt; ---------<br/>&gt; --mclaren</p><p>Keyboard is quite different from strings when it comes to playing and<br/>composing. As I noted above, I do very little composing at the<br/>instrument, but I will make a couple of comments about actually<br/>playing. When playing a fretless bass, you have so much control over<br/>the pitch and nuance of the sound that there is a feedback loop going<br/>between your inner sound and the sound you actually produce. When I am<br/>in the studio, I am unable to play well if I don&apos;t have a good sound<br/>in the headphones. If there are too many highs, I can hear the<br/>variations in the string wrapping as the amount and quality of the<br/>buzz changes from note to note, and I try to compensate at the<br/>fretboard. No good. You shouldn&apos;t have to be continually trying to<br/>find your sound by modifying your technique in response to the<br/>headphone sound. The same goes for live playing, but there I have<br/>direct control at the amp over the tone.</p><p>Gee, I hope this was useful. I found it very difficult to write about<br/>this because I think about the process so little. Thanks for pushing<br/>me though, Brian.</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
