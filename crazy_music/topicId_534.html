This scale certainly doesn&apos;t match that, but<br/>seems to resemble something more &quot;cell&quot; based.</p><p>Assuming it really does repeat at the 1272c then I looked at it<br/>as taking the 318 kernal and stacking it infinitely while<br/>subdividing it in the followinng way.</p><p>                       318<br/>                 121          197<br/>                           75     121<br/>               75   46<br/>                                46    75</p><p>The last step not taken in the original scale, but its just<br/>sitting there so I took it.

Or<br/>are you using a midi wind controller? I personally have been unable<br/>to get Scala to work with my Kurzweills, and usually either spin out<br/>a midi file in LISP using Symbolic Composer, which I then sculpt in<br/>Logic (don&apos;t get me started), or &quot;adapt&quot; it to 12 by picking and<br/>choosing from FTS.</p><p>Graham could use also talk more about how you use Kyma with the<br/>tunings.

It&apos;s all done with Smalltalk expressions, so you havea lot of flexibility, but no compatibility with existing tools.  I&apos;veincluded an example below.  I&apos;m sure it&apos;ll be possible to get aprototype to work everything out from the list of cents values, but Idon&apos;t know when I&apos;ll put in the time to work it out.&gt; I enjoyed your mouth harp piece, especially the resonant&gt; filter.  Was that done in Kyma?That should be &quot;mouth organ&quot; or &quot;blues harp&quot; or even &quot;harmonica&quot;.  Idon&apos;t know what mouth harps are, but apparently they do exist and aredifferent.Yes, the &quot;foot&quot; part of the foot and mouth organ was supplied usingKyma&apos;s much maligned filter, with a formant element to simulatetraditional resonance.  I learnt that trick on the online forum.The &quot;mouth&quot; part is a real mouth organ I recorded through mysoundcard.  It sounded quite harsh, so I ended up sending it throughmy regular guitar effects to round off the edges.The audio file is at &lt;<a href="http://www.microtonal.co.uk/fmorgan.mp3">http://www.microtonal.co.uk/fmorgan.mp3</a>&gt; foranybody interested.
