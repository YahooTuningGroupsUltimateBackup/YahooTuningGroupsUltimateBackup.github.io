The reason for this is simple -- I know how<br/>&gt; I&apos;d like to compose microtonally, and the tools I want don&apos;t<br/>&gt; exist yet.  So, I&apos;ve chosen to use my time to create those tools<br/>&gt; first.</p><p>Hi Carl,</p><p>I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve already done this, but I&apos;d like to invite you<br/>once again to join my justmusic list:<br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/justmusic">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/justmusic</a></p><p>That list is intended primarily for programmers and secondarily<br/>for mathematicians who can help the programmers, but anyone with<br/>a healthy interest in lattice diagrams *AND* their eventual use<br/>as a compositional aid is welcome, and you fit the bill.<br/>Note that recently Dave Keenan and Graham Breed have finally<br/>succumbed to my begging.  Paul hasn&apos;t yet, but I&apos;m still working<br/>on him too!  :)</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 1.  I built a 15-limit guitar.  I&apos;m not a guitarist, but this<br/>&gt; instrument is very valuable to me for ear training.  John<br/>&gt; Starrett (hi, John!) also showed me that in a guitarist&apos;s hands,<br/>&gt; the instrument was capable of making world-class music.  I<br/>&gt; almost gave it to him on the spot.</p><p>This is remarkably similar to an experience I had.  Microtonal<br/>wildman Brink McGoogy (who uses what I consider to be some of<br/>the most far-out tunings I&apos;ve ever heard described -- mostly<br/>phi-based, but I don&apos;t really understand what he&apos;s doing,<br/>altho I really like some of his music) is a frequent visitor<br/>to San Diego, and when he first saw my Rational Guitar (which<br/>really ought to be renamed Harmonic Guitar, because the frets<br/>give only harmonics of the lowest string), he jammed on it and<br/>made music I never thought possible.</p><p>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; New Method 3.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A keyboard with more than 12 tones per octave.  I&apos;ve read and<br/>&gt; traveled extensively to learn about what I want... I&apos;ve got every<br/>&gt; extant paper by Bosanquet on microfilm/xerox, I&apos;ve met with Erv<br/>&gt; Wilson, Michael Zarkey (and played his 19-of-31 harpsichord), and<br/>&gt; Scott Hackleman (and played his 19-tET clavichord), Harvey Starr<br/>&gt; (and fingered his prototype MicroZone), and Paul Vandervoort<br/>&gt; (and played his Janko-keyboard piano).  I even lived with Norman<br/>&gt; Henry for three months, playing his 11-limit harpsichord and<br/>&gt; helping him develop his 15-limit fortepiano.  My conclusion is<br/>&gt; that Wilson&apos;s hexagonal keys are not desirable.  Vandervoort has<br/>&gt; the best bet, and his MIDI controller (with polyphonic aftertouch,<br/>&gt; optical action, for about $2000!) will be along shortly.</p><p>Carl, you may have missed a lot of the early discussion about<br/>the MIRACLE tunings, in April and May of this year.  Graham and I<br/>(and perhaps Paul and Dave?) pretty much came to the conclusion<br/>that Harvey Starr&apos;s Ztar layout was the best way to accomodate<br/>this on a real instrument.  The Ztar has 144 keys, which maps<br/>2 full 8ves of the 72-EDO scale quite comfortably.  I&apos;ve also<br/>come up with a couple of good 31-tone mappings, since I&apos;m interested<br/>in exploring the Canasta version of MIRACLE.
