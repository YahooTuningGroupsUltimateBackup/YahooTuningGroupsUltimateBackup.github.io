This section seemed to<br/>distill *lots* of resources, and I was entirely unaware that so much<br/>had taken place in this field since Helmholtz...</p><p>The history sections, however, were also quite valuable, particularly<br/>the inclusion of extensive bibliographies.</p><p>Congrats again.  This is certainly a valuable read for anybody<br/>interested in alternate tunings...</p><p>________ _______ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
