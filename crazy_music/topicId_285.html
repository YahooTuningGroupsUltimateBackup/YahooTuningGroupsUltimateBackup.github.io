It seemed really like a book that Schoenberg *had* to write<br/>in order to conduct his classes...</p><p>I can&apos;t imagine a modern editor letting an author include so<br/>many &quot;apologia&quot; about the text and the book in a work.  Obviously,<br/>Schoenberg insisted on it, or had a very &quot;liberal&quot; editor...</p><p>In any case, Schoenberg&apos;s theories have little to do with the *best*<br/>of his music, which can possibly be characterized as *dramatic* more<br/>than anything.  Take _Pierrot Lunaire_ for example.  More drama,<br/>really, than music.  Not too much theory there, on the overall...</p><p>_Five Pieces for Orchestra_... well, there could be some theory there<br/>in the &quot;Klangfarbenmelodie...&quot;  However, when we hear possible &quot;fish<br/>are jumpin&apos;&quot; practically a la Gershwin, it belies the theoretical<br/>emphasis on that third piece as well...</p><p>So, granted... Schoenberg was really not so much of a theorist... 12<br/>tone system notwithstanding (which he later dropped in favor of<br/>more &quot;tonal&quot; music.)</p><p>Perhaps Schoenberg is only a pimple on music THEORY&apos;S posterior... it<br/>comes from having much &quot;sitzenfleish...&quot;</p><p>______ ______ ______<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
