(not implemented yet but soon)</p><p>It&apos;s not perfect and will be under construction but you might like to check<br/>it out for fun -- I had a lot of fun writing it so far and plan to make many<br/>additions, a couple which are described above.</p><p>Oh, almost forgot, here it is:</p><p><a href="http://www.nonoctave.com/forum/">http://www.nonoctave.com/forum/</a></p><p>It&apos;s experimental and may change but try it out if you like (*Especially* if<br/>you are working on the cutting edge with nonoctave tunings or non-just<br/>non-equal tunings or rational tunings.) Thanks!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
