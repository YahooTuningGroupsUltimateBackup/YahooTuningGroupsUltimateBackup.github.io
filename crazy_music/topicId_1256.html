The software will be called<br/>&quot;GarageBand&quot;. Also, MIDI keyboard controllers designed to work well with the<br/>software will be sold for $99 at all apple stores.</p><p>Current mac owners can either pay $49 to upgrade to the new suite, including<br/>4 other apps, or can presumably download the software for free from the<br/>apple site, along with the other four iLife apps.</p><p>The code base appears to be basically a Lite version of emagic Logic, which<br/>Apple acquired 2 years back.</p><p>No word on whether microtonality will be supported or even possible. Stay<br/>tuned.</p></div>
