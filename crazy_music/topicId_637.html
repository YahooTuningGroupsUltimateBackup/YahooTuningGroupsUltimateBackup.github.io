(The post that created<br/>&gt; the most laughter, if memory serves, was Beardsley&apos;s<br/>&gt; ludicrous claim that vibrato is a bad idea for<br/>&gt; microtonal music. Only someone with no competence as<br/>&gt; a musician could make such a bizarre claim...sadly,<br/>&gt; all too typical for David Beardsley&apos;s posts.)<br/>&gt;    In each case I state facts.</p><p>Actually, you&apos;re far worse for microtonality than any vibrato Net Kook.</p><p>db</p></div>
