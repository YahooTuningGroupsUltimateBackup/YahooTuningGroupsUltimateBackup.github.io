I find<br/>the tunings and theories of many other writers to be more<br/>interesting.</p><p>&gt;    Contrariwise, all musical practices antithetical to the<br/>&gt; &quot;pure perfect natural chord of nature&quot; are considered to<br/>&gt; have a diablic character. Commas are shunned; equal<br/>&gt; temperament is considered &quot;degraded&quot; and &quot;degenerate&quot; and<br/>&gt; &quot;adulterated&quot; -- in fact, sinful and evil, though the JI<br/>&gt; moonies seldom admit it outright.</p><p>Citations, please! - *I* don&apos;t believe this.</p><p>I don&apos;t consider any musical practices &quot;to have a diabolical<br/>character&quot;, except insofar as they are associated with the<br/>sleazy practices of much of the music *business*, including<br/>record companies, club owners, lawyers, mafia goons, etc.<br/>(I have had ugly run-ins with all of them... yuck.)</p><p>I don&apos;t shun commas, in fact I rather enjoy playing with them.</p><p>And I enjoy hearing, playing, composing in, and theorizing<br/>about many different equal temperaments.</p><p>&gt;    Thus, the fanatical belief system adhered to by JI<br/>&gt; moonies is a form of Manichean belief -- it postis<br/>&gt; [_sic_: posits] two fundamental forces in the universe,<br/>&gt; the forces of light and the armies of darkness.</p><p>Citations, please! - *I* don&apos;t believe this.</p><p>&gt;    To the JI moonies, some musical practices are inehrently<br/>&gt; good (4:5:6 chord and the subharmonic 1/4:1/5:1/6 minor, the<br/>&gt; harmonic series, 5-limit diatonic just intonation, the<br/>&gt; diatonic just major scale, etc.) while all other musical<br/>&gt; practices are inherently evil.</p><p>Citations, please! - *I* don&apos;t believe this.</p><p>&gt;    The primarily activities of JI moonies do not center<br/>&gt; around making music.  Instead, the lives of the JI moonies<br/>&gt; center around the effort to search out heresy, to make their<br/>&gt; own fanatical musical belief system even more pure by<br/>&gt; weeding out any trace of doctrinal divergence, and the<br/>&gt; effort to shore up the fanatical musical belief system of<br/>&gt; the &quot;chord of nature,&quot; all the while recruiting new JI<br/>&gt; moonies for the Sacred Cause.</p><p>Citations, please!</p><p>This is not my &quot;primarily&quot; acitivity, nor my primary activity.</p><p>&gt;   Like any other cult, the JI moonies have little interest<br/>&gt; in getting things done in the real world. Their first and<br/>&gt; overriding concern is to increase the size of their cult --<br/>&gt; thus, they must constantly proselytize everyone else on the<br/>&gt; supreme glories of the One True Faith, the Great and<br/>&gt; Glorious Path To Ultimate Musical FUlfillment, the One True<br/>&gt; Church of Music...the sacred ideal pure perfect natural<br/>&gt; &quot;chord of nature&quot; (the godhead) and its sacred stations of<br/>&gt; the cross, the harmonic series and the 5-limit JI etc.</p><p>Citations, please! - *I* don&apos;t do this.</p><p>&gt;   Like any other cult, the JI moonies also seek to insure<br/>&gt; the supremacy of their cult (and increase it size by getting<br/>&gt; converts) by destroying and crushing and wiping out all<br/>&gt; competing belief systems.</p><p>Citations, please! - *I* don&apos;t seek to do this.</p><p>Exactly the opposite: I treasure diversity in every aspect<br/>of music, including tuning.</p><p>&gt; Thus, just as with the AUm Shin<br/>&gt; Rikyo cult and the Dianetics cult and all the other cults,<br/>&gt; the other main activity of cult members (other than<br/>&gt; prosyltizing for the faith) involves the fanatical effort to<br/>&gt; cursh and silence all critics of the cult.</p><p>Citations, please! - This is not *my* &quot;other main activity&quot;.</p><p>&gt; The first thing any JI moonie does on a discussion group is<br/>&gt; to preach the supreme glories of the sacred 4:5:6 chord.</p><p>Citations, please! - *I* don&apos;t do this.</p><p>&gt; Theinstant [_sic_: The instant] anyone doubts the fanatical<br/>&gt; belief system of the JI moonie, we immediately encounter a<br/>&gt; fusillade of insults and verbal attacks and hysterical lies,<br/>&gt; all designed to crush and silence any criticism of the<br/>&gt; JI moonies&apos; fanatical belief system (namely, the &quot;pure<br/>&gt; perfect natural chord of nature,&quot; the godhead of the JI<br/>&gt; moonies, and its associated stations of the cross -- the<br/>&gt; harmonic series, 5-limit just intonation, etc.)</p><p>Citations, please! - *I* don&apos;t do any of this.</p><p>&gt;    Most JI moonies produce no music at all.

Their belief system comes<br/>&gt; from Friedrich Herder by way of Georg Hegel, and combines<br/>&gt; elements of B. F. Skinner&apos;s behaviorism (actually a<br/>&gt; refinement of Locke&apos;s rationalist Enlightenment philosophy)<br/>&gt; with the Hegelian doctrine of historical determinism.</p><p>Citations, please!</p><p>I&apos;m barely familiar with any of the stuff written by these<br/>guys; mainly only a faded memory of Skinner&apos;s work, from<br/>a high-school psychology class.</p><p>&gt;   According to the modernist musical Branch Davidians,<br/>&gt; history is an ascending ramp and the human mind is  tabula<br/>&gt; rasa, a blank slate with no inherent characteristics.</p><p>Citations, please! - *I* don&apos;t believe this.</p><p>&gt; According to the modernist musical Branch Davidians,<br/>&gt; inevitable historical processes drive musical practices, and<br/>&gt; the individual composer&apos;s only purpose is to discover this<br/>&gt; inevitable historical engine hidden within the music of each<br/>&gt; era and push music forward, up the ramp of history, on a<br/>&gt; never-ending ascent of Musical Progress toward the ultimate<br/>&gt; state of Musical Nirvana.</p><p>Citations, please! - *I* don&apos;t believe this.</p><p>&gt;  In order [_sic_: word missing: to] force musical progress<br/>&gt; forward, the individual composer (if s/he is historically<br/>&gt; worthwhile) must break the old set of musical rules and<br/>&gt; creat new ones through the force of hi/r genius, thereby<br/>&gt; forcing the reactionary and backward-looking audience to<br/>&gt; appreicate the wondrous musical value of his new<br/>&gt; compositional practice by subjecting the audience and hi/r<br/>&gt; critics to so much of hi/r new music that they become<br/>&gt; conditioned to it and finally perceive it as beautiful.</p><p>Citations, please!</p><p>This doesn&apos;t describe the way I compose.  Mostly, I simply<br/>have fun playing with sound.  When I break the &quot;rules&quot;, it&apos;s<br/>because I enjoy playing with what I perceive to be the<br/>listener&apos;s expectations (based on my own expectations as<br/>an as-objective-as-possible listener), and doing something<br/>that at first seems unexpected but in hindsight, after<br/>hearing more of the piece, makes perfect logical sense.</p><p>This procedure is something I have discerned in some of<br/>my favorite composers, such as Beethoven, Mahler, Schoenberg,<br/>Ravel, Gershwin, Robert Johnson, John Coltrane, the Beatles,<br/>Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen,<br/>and Public Enemy.</p><p>Because I admire and enjoy their work so much, I emulate this<br/>aspect of their methods in my own pieces.  At his point, it<br/>constitutes one of the recognizable aspects of my own &quot;style&quot;.</p><p>&gt;   The path to musical Nirvana at the end of the ever-<br/>&gt; ascending ramp of historical musical progress (according to<br/>&gt; the modernist Musical Branch Davidian) requires more and<br/>&gt; more musical complexity, more and more theory, more and more<br/>&gt; elaborate mathematics, more and more technology.</p><p>The first half of this paragraph doesn&apos;t apply to me.</p><p>I suppose an examination of my recent work, and my postings<br/>to the various tuning lists, would give an observer the idea<br/>that the charges levelled in the second half of this paragraph<br/>could be construed as applying to me.</p><p>The only reasons I have so much to say about any of these<br/>things are:</p><p>  1) I really enjoy studying tuning theory, especially<br/>     its history,</p><p>  2) I *really* enjoy the artwork that goes into making<br/>     lattice diagrams, as well as the final result, and</p><p>  3) I hope to mold some of my very imaginative ideas<br/>     about manipulating visual representations of sound<br/>     (specifically, the pitch aspect of it) into a very<br/>     powerful software application that will provide ways<br/>     that are easier and more intuitive, to compose and<br/>     analyze microtonal music.  See<br/>     &lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/justmusic">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/justmusic</a>&gt;.</p><p>It so happens that mathematics and technology play quite<br/>a large role in all three of these endeavors.</p><p>&gt;   Thus, like the other fanatical musical belief system, the<br/>&gt; modernist musical Branch Davidians also susbscribe to a form<br/>&gt; of Manichean belief:  to the modernist musical Branch<br/>&gt; Davidian, mathematical methods of creating music = good,<br/>&gt; non-mathematical = evil; complexity = good, while simplicity<br/>&gt; = evil; progress toward a glorious music future = good,<br/>&gt; regression to past musical practices = evil; anything new in<br/>&gt; music = good, anything anyone has already done = evil; more<br/>&gt; tchnology = good, while less technology = evil.</p><p>Citations, please!</p><p>*I* don&apos;t subscribe to this &quot;belief&quot;, which is actually<br/>a whole set of beliefs.  I don&apos;t subscribe to any of them.</p><p>&gt;   And so the modernist musical Branch Davidian also liveis<br/>&gt; in a musical world divided into forces of light and armies<br/>&gt; of darkness.  In this case, the forces of light are the<br/>&gt; forward-looking modernist composers who bravely cast aside<br/>&gt; such outworn cliches as recognizable melodies and functional<br/>&gt; harmonies and perceptible rhythms and audible musical<br/>&gt; organize.  Meanwhile, the armies of darkness are the<br/>&gt; regressive subhuman troglydytes who cling to obsolete and<br/>&gt; essentially fascistic musical usages like tonality, musical<br/>&gt; beauty, acousticaly smooth musical intervals, perceptible<br/>&gt; musical structures, intuition, emotion, etc.</p><p>Citations, please!</p><p>Wrong yet again in my case, Brian.  You&apos;ve heard my music.<br/>You *know* that the *majority* of it is filled with &quot;tonality,<br/>musical beauty, acousticaly smooth musical intervals,<br/>perceptible musical structures, intuition, emotion, etc.&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;m basically a pop-tune composer with a healthy interest<br/>in an extremely wide variety of other types of music, and<br/>a very great admiration for late-romantic symphonic music<br/>(especially Austrian) in particular.</p><p>So why in the world are you, a few more paragraphs on,<br/>going to accuse me of being a member of this &quot;faction&quot;?</p><p>Citations, *please*!</p><p>&gt;    Like all other cults, the modernist musical Branch<br/>&gt; Davidians do not have time to produce much music -- if any.<br/>&gt; Most modernist musical Branch Davidians produce no music at<br/>&gt; all. (Alan Forte, Robert Morris, et alii)  The sole activity<br/>&gt; of these people is to produce ever-more elbaorate and ever-<br/>&gt; more mathematicaly complex theory to bolster the agenda of<br/>&gt; the modernist musical Branch Davidians.</p><p>Citations, please!</p><p>Doesn&apos;t apply to me.  As I stated in my last refutation<br/>of your charges, I produce and upload to my website new<br/>music every week, whether brand new compositions or<br/>theoretical illustrations composed by me, or my MIDI<br/>versions of masterworks of the past.</p><p>&gt; The other main activities of the modernist musical<br/>&gt; Branch Davidians involve search [_sic_: searching] out<br/>&gt; heretics and backsliders &lt;snip&gt;</p><p>Citations, please!</p><p>*I&apos;m* certainly not interested in wasting my time &quot;searching<br/>out heretics and backsliders&quot;.  Exactly the opposite.<br/>I&apos;m interested in learning all I can about all the different<br/>musics of the world, and the theories about them.  I keep<br/>my mind wide open to learning about any new tuning idea<br/>I&apos;m able to understand.</p><p>&gt;   Since musical modernism involves a foreordained and<br/>&gt; predestined process which is historically inevitable<br/>&gt; (according to the modernistm musical Branch Davidian),<br/>&gt; anyone who criticizes the modernist musical agenda<br/>&gt; &lt;...&gt; is not merely an enemy of modernist music... Such<br/>&gt; critics and dissneters are enemies of progress itself,<br/>&gt; they are the enemies of all humanity, and as such they<br/>&gt; must be crushed and silenced, wiped out, destroyed and<br/>&gt; annihilated to the last man, woman and child.</p><p>Citations, please!</p><p>Again, I refuted in my last response to you the charge<br/>that this kind of aggressive behavior applies to me.<br/>It does not, and never will.  I am a pacifist and a<br/>firm believer in non-violent solutions to confrontation.</p><p>&gt;   The modernist musical Branch Davidian thus takes on<br/>&gt; the role of a commissar in the former Soviet Union. S/he<br/>&gt; dictates the content of new music concerts in order to<br/>&gt; condition the regressive and ignorant audiences to the<br/>&gt; unspeakable gloies [_sic_] of the latest New Music<br/>&gt; (all musical likes and dislikes are merely a matter of<br/>&gt; Skinner-type operant conditioning, acccorind to the<br/>&gt; modernist musical Branch Davidian), while forcing the<br/>&gt; progress of New Music through the latest musical<br/>&gt; Five-Year Plan (ever more math, ever more theory, ever<br/>&gt; more complexity), and insuring the success of the project<br/>&gt; by searching out and destroying all &quot;counterrevolutionary&quot;<br/>&gt; musical activity and crushing and silencing it.</p><p>Citations, *please*!!!!!!!!!</p><p>It&apos;s *ridiculous* to claim that any of this has anything<br/>at all to do with me, or that I have anything at all to<br/>do with any of it.  The only &quot;authority&quot; I possess anywhere<br/>at all is in my webpages and tuning-lists posts, and there,<br/>I always express a very catholic interest in all aspects<br/>of tuning, and never propogate any narrow opinion or<br/>viewpoint.</p><p>Now, on to a consideration of citations you use against<br/>the &quot;modernist musical Branch Davidian belief system&quot;.</p><p>&gt;    &quot;[Schoenberg&apos;s] miscalculations nonetheless nudge us into<br/>&gt; recognizing something about art that seems to have eluded<br/>&gt; several prominent thinkers of the early twentieth century.</p><p>Ahhhh.... at last, we finally come to the subject which<br/>causes you to include *me* in all this nonsense.</p><p>&gt; The sorry fact is that if art can be said to evolve at all,<br/>&gt; it does not evolve in the simple direct and unidimensional<br/>&gt; way Schoenberg imagined. It cannot, and for at least two<br/>&gt; reasons. First, as Leonard B. Meyer has said, &grave;Most<br/>&gt; compositions &grave;solve&apos; a host of problems -- that is,<br/>&gt; reconcile a variety of claims, some of which, at least,<br/>&gt; cannot be accounted for on internal grounds alone.&apos; [Meyer,<br/>&gt; &quot;Innovation, Choice, and the History of Music,&quot; pg. 536]</p><p>I find this *really* amusing.</p><p>Again and again, Schoenberg wrote about &quot;compositional<br/>problems&quot;.

Their attempt started exactly as on<br/>&gt; the original Mills College Alternative Tuning List -- by<br/>&gt; flooding the list with vast lists of numbers and equations<br/>&gt; and huge quantities of abstract speculations with no<br/>&gt; discernible connection to actual microtonal music. The point<br/>&gt; men for the modernist musical Branch Davidians were Steven<br/>&gt; Kallstrom and Dan Stearns.<br/>&gt;    My posts stoppped that power grab but blew apart the old<br/>&gt; practical microtonality list.<br/>&gt;     Withal, notice that no one has tried a similar power<br/>&gt; grab on this current practical microtonality group. It has<br/>&gt; become clear that the price for trying to flood this list<br/>&gt; with numbers and equations and idle theoretical speculations<br/>&gt; will be too high for the modernist musical Branch Davidians<br/>&gt; who attempt it.</p><p>All hail Brian McLaren, the savior and liberator of the<br/>practicalmicrotonality groups!  (that&apos;s sarcasm, in case<br/>anyone out there is too eye-glazed or bored to catch it...)</p><p>No, Brian... what really happened is that on 20 May 2001<br/>(exactly one week before this crazy_music list was created,<br/>and 10 days before the original practicalmicrotonality list<br/>disappeared), a new group called &quot;tuning-math&quot; was created,<br/>so that those of us who like to write long posts filled with<br/>mathematical stuff that we believe has something to do with<br/>tuning, can do so without bothering - and without interference<br/>from - those subscribers on other tuning lists who don&apos;t like<br/>to read such stuff, don&apos;t want their mailboxes filled with<br/>massive amounts of junk they&apos;re not interested in, and/or<br/>don&apos;t believe that it has anything to do with music, and<br/>who feel the need to complain about it publicly, loudly,<br/>and aggressively.</p><p>We have our safe haven and we use it, and are now happy<br/>to leave that kind of thing off of the other tuning lists<br/>as much as possible.  And we know that everyone else who<br/>reads it appreciates it as much as the person who posted<br/>it, and that those who don&apos;t want it appreciate the fact<br/>that we don&apos;t shove it down their throats.</p><p>(Hint, hint... can you learn something from this?<br/>There are now enough different kinds of tuning lists<br/>with different topicalities, that there&apos;s no reason<br/>why you can&apos;t belong to several, as many of us do,<br/>and post on-topic articles to the appropriate list.<br/>In fact one particular list, tuning-challenges, was<br/>created specifically as a forum for you, Brian McLaren,<br/>and you have so far refused to accept public invitations<br/>to join it.  There&apos;s no need for you to insistently<br/>badger those on this list who have expressed a negative<br/>reaction to your style, when you can go there and post<br/>anything and as much of it as you want to.)</p><p>As the evidence either indicates or implies, the one<br/>and only person who has tried to make a &quot;power grab&quot;<br/>on this list is... *you*!</p><p>You attempt to &quot;dominate the list&quot; with posts that are<br/>much longer than what many people here are interested<br/>in reading [citation: this list&apos;s archives], and you<br/>have bombarded the Files section with up to 10 or so<br/>new mp3&apos;s at a time [citation: this list&apos;s archives].</p><p>And lest you respond by claiming that I&apos;m &quot;attacking&quot;<br/>you, I&apos;m not.

Eliminating the photographs of discredited Central<br/>&gt; Committee Members is good if it silences dissent.  Character<br/>&gt; assassination is good if it deters the enemies of Glorious<br/>&gt; Soviet Socialist progress. And so on.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    WHY DO THE JI MOONIES AND THE MODERNIST MUSICAL BRANCH<br/>&gt; DAVIDIANS PRODUCE SO LITTLE MUSIC?</p><p>BECAUSE YOU KEEP SCREAMING CHARGES AT US THAT WE FEEL<br/>OBLIGED TO WASTE OUR TIME REFUTING!</p><p>&gt;     In essence, these 2 belief systems boil down to efforts<br/>&gt; to force music into a static steady state from which there<br/>&gt; can be escape, no change, no alteration. In the case of the<br/>&gt; JI moonies, the static steady state, the ideal goal for all<br/>&gt; music, is pure perfect natural 5-limit just intonation which<br/>&gt; sounds the &quot;chord of nature&quot; over and over again, without<br/>&gt; end.  On the other hand, in the case of the modernist<br/>&gt; musical Branch Davidians, the static steady state is a<br/>&gt; modernistic music which is so new and so complex that [_sic_:<br/>&gt; superflous word] and so futuristics [_sic_: futuristic]<br/>&gt; that no melodies and no harmonies and rhythms and no audible<br/>&gt; organization can be perceived.</p><p>Citations, please!  What gives you *any* grounds at all for<br/>including me in either of these two supposed &quot;belief systems&quot;?</p><p>  1) I *do not* believe that there should be any &quot;efforts to<br/>     force music into a static steady state from which there<br/>     can be escape, no change, no alteration&quot;.  Quite the<br/>     opposite.  One reason I&apos;m so fascinated with tuning math<br/>     and theory is the endless variety of different tunings<br/>     and ideas for their use and about their effects.</p><p>And, incidentally, since you&apos;ve accused *him* of it too,<br/>neither did Schoenberg believe this charge - in fact,<br/>he rails against precisely this very viewpoint:</p><p>In conclusion to his polemic against Schenker&apos;s insistence<br/>on a 5-limit, to which I referred in my 41-K post where<br/>I correct your page-number error in a citation from the<br/>_Harmonielehre_, Schoenberg wrote:  [1911: p __, 1978: p 319]</p><p>&gt;&gt; Such errors result whenever one merely searches out<br/>&gt;&gt; reasons enough to explain what is known, instead of<br/>&gt;&gt; providing a surplus of reasons to embrace cases that<br/>&gt;&gt; do not yet exist.  Such errors result whenever one<br/>&gt;&gt; takes the *known* phenomena to be the *only ones* there<br/>&gt;&gt; are, to be the ultimate and immutable manifestations of<br/>&gt;&gt; nature, and *explains only these*, instead of contemplating<br/>&gt;&gt; nature comprehensively in its relation to our feelings<br/>&gt;&gt; and perceptions.  If the latter viewpoint is taken, these<br/>&gt;&gt; phenomena will reveal that they are not conclusive, not<br/>&gt;&gt; final, not definitive; rather that they are a small part<br/>&gt;&gt; of an immense, *incaluable* [emphasis Monzo&apos;s] whole, in<br/>&gt;&gt; which the number five is just as interesting as, but no<br/>&gt;&gt; more mysterious than, all other numbers, be they prime numbers,<br/>&gt;&gt; products, or powers.  [other emphases all Schoenberg&apos;s]</p><p>That last clause refers so strongly to my own theory that,<br/>despite Schoenberg&apos;s professed lack of mathematical knowledge,<br/>it betrays his keen understanding of what he was hearing.</p><p>&lt;quote email&gt;</p><p>And I note with *tremendous* amusement that Schoenberg had<br/>as little faith in musical mathematics as you do!  [citation:<br/>my emphasis on Schoenberg&apos;s word &quot;incalculable&quot;].</p><p>Yet you hold him up as a paradigm of someone who simply<br/>played with numbers and created no worthwhile music.</p><p>He *did* concern himself extensively with numerology, but<br/>was also a brilliant composer. (And here I stop, because it<br/>enters the realm of opinion, which is not my purpose here.)</p><p>  2) I do not believe even a tiny bit that &apos;the ideal goal<br/>     for all music, is pure perfect natural 5-limit just<br/>     intonation which sounds the &quot;chord of nature&quot; over and<br/>     over again, without end&apos;.</p><p>     True, I like just-intonation, but, as with you, 5-limit<br/>     is only one variety of it that I compose in.  And I also<br/>     like 19- and 72-EDO, still write plenty of music in the<br/>     dreaded 12-EDO, am experimenting with other EDOs, and<br/>     also with a variety of meantones and irregular temperaments.</p><p>  3) While it&apos;s true that I do like many pieces by others and<br/>     do write some myself that can be described as &quot;modernistic<br/>     music which is so new and so complex that and so<br/>     futuristics [_sic_] that no melodies and no harmonies<br/>     and rhythms and no audible organization can be perceived&quot;,<br/>     I&apos;m very far from believing that that&apos;s how all music<br/>     should be.</p><p>     In fact, I find many of your own &quot;nebulous&quot;-style<br/>     pieces to fit this description.  My music usually has a<br/>     much stronger rhythmic drive than yours, as well as<br/>     melodies that I think are more recognizable as &quot;tunes&quot;<br/>     than yours.  This is not meant as any kind of disparagement<br/>     of your compositions, and please don&apos;t take it that way.</p><p>     I like a lot of your music; I&apos;m simply stating what I<br/>     perceive to be some different characteristics between<br/>     our respective styles, which relate directly to the<br/>     statements you make in connection with the &quot;Davidians&quot;.</p><p>&gt; Erv Wilson has described 5-limit just intonation of the<br/>&gt; kind pushed by John deLaubenfels and David Doty as<br/>&gt; &quot;sounding to insipid that if the word &grave;insipid&apos; were not<br/>&gt; part of the English language, it would be necessary to<br/>&gt; invent it to describe this music.&quot;<br/>&gt;    Most practicing musicians agree.  Practicing musicians<br/>&gt; find unacceptably bland and boring the ideal static steady<br/>&gt; state espoused by the JI moonies.</p><p>Citations, please!  Show me where &quot;Most practicing musicians<br/>agree&quot;... I would wager that not even a tiny fraction of<br/>one percent have ever even heard of John deLaubenfels.</p><p>(No offense against you intended, John...<br/>simply making an extremely rough estimate.)</p><p>And *PLEASE* show me where Erv Wilson &quot;described<br/>5-limit just intonation of the kind pushed by John<br/>deLaubenfels&quot;.  I&apos;m really interested in seeing this.</p><p>For one thing, deLaubenfels doesn&apos;t push fixed JI,<br/>but rather, adaptive JI, which is a dynamic on-the-fly<br/>distribution of fractions-of-a-comma adjustments;<br/>and he doesn&apos;t limit himself to 5-limit - he&apos;s retuned<br/>pieces of mine into adaptive 7- and 11-limit.  I sent two<br/>posts to this recently about my &quot;Bulgarian choral piece&quot;<br/>which John rendered into adaptive 11-limit and is sitting<br/>right now in the Files section of this list (in a lo-fi<br/>version).  I&apos;m not arguing against what you say about<br/>&quot;JI moonies&quot;, but you can hardly claim with any evidence<br/>that what deLaubenfels &quot;pushes&quot; has anything to do with a<br/>&quot;static steady state&quot;.</p><p>Secondly, when deLaubenfels uses a fixed tuning at<br/>all (which he calls COFT, &quot;Calculated Optimum Fixed<br/>Tuning&quot;), it&apos;s for purposes of &quot;grounding&quot; his dynamic<br/>tuning and it has little to do with any actual JI<br/>tuning.  Rather, it distributes fractions-of-a-comma<br/>adjustments resulting in something resembling an irregular<br/>well-temperament, so as to preserve as many JI vertical<br/>sonorities as possible, and this procedure is entirely<br/>dependent on the actual vertical sonorities in any<br/>given piece, which must be analyzed before retuning<br/>by his methods is possible.</p><p>Thirdly, I doubt very strongly that Erv has ever even<br/>heard of John deLaubenfels, whose work, while it bears<br/>a resemblance to ideas of Vicentino and other more<br/>modern adaptive-tuning experimenters, to my knowledge<br/>is unique.  If this is the case, then how could Erv<br/>possibly describe a tuning &quot;of the kind pushed by<br/>John deLaubenfels&quot;?</p><p>Your errors in describing deLaubenfels&apos;s work demonstrate<br/>that you have devoted very little time and/or attention<br/>to studying or listening to his body of work.</p><p>[Excellent Norman Cazden and Robert Walker quotes snipped<br/>and ignored, because now at 3 AM I simply refuse to spend<br/>any more time on this other than the proofreading I&apos;m doing<br/>right now.]</p><p>&gt;     On the other side of the fence, both audiences and<br/>&gt; composers have largely rejected the musical work product of<br/>&gt; the modernist musical Branch Davidians.

But I also hold firmly to<br/>the belief that non-verbal visual representations of<br/>sound (i.e., musical notations, lattice diagrams) *do*<br/>impart information about music and about tunings which<br/>can be at least distantly, and perhaps closely, related<br/>to what can be heard.</p><p>Anyway, each person hears the same thing differently<br/>to some extent, so listening is perhaps no less fallible<br/>a method for determining the &quot;sonic fingerprint&quot; of a<br/>tuning than is seeing a visual representation.</p><p>&gt;     [3]  Hands-one [_sic_: on] experience seems to show<br/>&gt; that there is no such thing as a &quot;good&quot; tuning or a &quot;bad&apos;<br/>&gt; tuning -- experience compsing in a wide variety of tunings<br/>&gt; has shown me that no musical tuning is musically worthless,<br/>&gt; and no musical tuning is &quot;unusually musically useful above<br/>&gt; all others.&quot;</p><p>I agree *almost* totally with this.  &quot;Almost&quot;, because I<br/>disagree *somewhat* with your contention that &apos;no musical<br/>tuning is &quot;unusually musically useful above all others.&quot; &apos;</p><p>I&apos;d mitigate that statement somewhat, eliminating the bit<br/>about &quot;above all others&quot;.  In that light, certain tunings<br/>(two examples: 12-EDO and 19-EDO) *do* in fact imply a<br/>wealth of harmonic and melodic resources with a small<br/>number of distinct pitches, and so at least in the sense<br/>of what might be called a &quot;high signal-to-noise ratio&quot;,<br/>they are &quot;unusually musically useful above&quot; *some* &quot;others&quot;.</p><p>&gt;     [4] Hands-on experience seems to indicate that neither<br/>&gt; any JI system nor any JI [_sic_: ET?] system nor any NJ NET<br/>&gt; system represents any kind of musical &quot;final state&quot; or &quot;ideal&quot;<br/>&gt; for music. Hands-on experience seems to show that all three<br/>&gt; general categories of tuning (just, equal tempered, and non-<br/>&gt; jsut [_sic_: non-just] non-equal-tempered) can produce equally<br/>&gt; vivid and memorable music, depending on the style and composer<br/>&gt; and the timbres etc.</p><p>I totally agree with this, as well as with your dictum that<br/>&quot;the panty sizes of the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders could be<br/>used to produce a valid tuning system&quot;... in fact, I think<br/>I&apos;ll come up with a grant proposal to do the research and<br/>try that one out!  ;-)</p><p>&gt;     Then study the assertions made by various JI moonies and<br/>&gt; modernist musical Branch Davidians and ask yourself -- who<br/>&gt; is the fanatic?<br/>&gt;     The person who presents evidence and asks you to decide<br/>&gt; for yourself?<br/>&gt;     Or the person who merely quotes from authority figures<br/>&gt; like Arnold Schoenberg and Hermann Helmholtz, and never<br/>&gt; posts any music on this tuning list so that you can evaluate<br/>&gt; the audible evidence using your own judgment?</p><p>Citation:  mp3&apos;s and MIDI-files of my versions of selections<br/>from several of Schoenberg&apos;s early (c. 1894 - 1912) compositions<br/>are readily accessible from my webpage<br/>&quot;A Century of New Music in Vienna&quot;:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/schoenberg/Vienna1905.htm</a>&gt;.</p><p>Is it absolutely necessary that I take up space on &quot;this<br/>tuning list&quot; by uploading these files *here*, in order to<br/>prove to you that I&apos;m not &quot;the person who merely quotes<br/>from authority figures like Arnold Schoenberg... and never<br/>posts any music on this tuning list so that you can evaluate<br/>the audible evidence using your own judgment&quot;?

A good musician can<br/>make good music with the most unlikely materials.

I fully believe that nothing<br/>audible is musically useless.</p><p>The test of &quot;real music in the real world&quot; is really silly when you<br/>look at it as a working composer rather than an academic.  If I<br/>applied that test it would mean I could never make any kind of<br/>innovation in music.  As soon as I had an idea that couldn&apos;t be found<br/>in &quot;real music in the real world&quot; I would have to reject it as a<br/>bad theory.  That&apos;s plain silly.  And the logical conclusion *is*<br/>that Ivor should have avoided saying, or maybe even thinking anything<br/>about these tunings until he found some &quot;real music in the real<br/>world&quot; to support his theories.  His intuition as a musician<br/>apparently wouldn&apos;t have been good enough, only &quot;real music in the<br/>real world&quot; is the test of a theory.</p><p>In a world in which music is overwhelmingly not written in 6 or 8<br/>note equal temperament, where 11-tone ditties have yet to take the<br/>pop charts by storm, where 13-tone compositions are enjoyed only by a<br/>few kooks on an Internet mailing list, where the average concert goer<br/>has never been exposed to 16-tone music, where a violinist wouldn&apos;t<br/>know an 18-tone scale it came up and bit them on the nose and 23-tone<br/>music is notably absent from the local music store, the only<br/>conclusion you can draw from &quot;real music&quot; is that it has a remarkable<br/>tendency not to use these tunings.</p><p>Sorry to mix genuine controversy in amongst the caricatures and<br/>hyperbole,</p><p>                     Graham</p><p>          (JI Moonie who doesn&apos;t use JI)</p></div>
