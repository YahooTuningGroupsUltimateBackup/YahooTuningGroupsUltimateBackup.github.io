Rebooted and the problem disappeared.  Ah the sweet<br/>&gt; mysteries of Windows 98.</p><p>Could be some other clip had set expression to 0.</p><p>I wonder, usually my midi clips set the expression to max for<br/>all the channels in case a previous midi clip faded them to 0<br/>at the end, or varied them for some other reason.</p><p>However, realised the record to Midi as one plays along in beta preview<br/>doesn&apos;t do that, and in fact, not sure if it ever did reset the expression<br/>for the record play along to Midi, and I&apos;ve fixed it ready for next beta<br/>preview upload - I&apos;ll prob. upload it later today.</p><p>&gt; About three minutes into the 17 TET piece I did find myself nodding<br/>&gt; into alpha, although there was one dissonant chord that brought me<br/>&gt; right back.  Perhaps there is something to harmonic entropy where<br/>&gt; trancing is falling into those dips in the curve :-)</p><p>I wonder, the one a friend went into a trance with was in 12-tet<br/>but had plenty of dissonances. I think even things like playing<br/>all 12 notes simultaneously - I used to do a lot of playing<br/>with motion from diatonic to chromatic by playing on the white<br/>notes and gradually introducing more and more of the black ones,<br/>then going back to the white ones, which gives a very static kind<br/>of music, not going anywhere, just more and less chromatic, which<br/>I like.</p><p>Could be she just meant she dipped in and out of that kind of a state.<br/>Or are we perhaps more familiar with 12-tet dissonances.</p><p>I wonder if someone who trances easily needs to be careful about the<br/>type of music you listen to when driving, if listening to any music<br/>at all? I suppose that is what I had in mind about kind of warning about it.</p><p>I suppose when one listens to music intently, say, something like a<br/>string quartet, one gets so absorbed in the music, one is less aware<br/>of everything else - I don&apos;t know if that is related to the trance<br/>idea. Do you know the Hoffnung short cartoon about a string quartet<br/>playing away while their stage is dismantled and placed on a lorry,<br/>and so forth, not aware of anything around them, so absorbed in the<br/>music?</p><p>That certainly happens to me to some extent, and I think it is prob.<br/>fairly common. One is still aware of the music, but one kind of feels<br/>it as much as one hears it. I expect many musicians who think they<br/>never go into a trance can relate to that experience, but I don&apos;t know<br/>if it is the same thing. After all one can also get completely absorbed and<br/>lost in a book one is reading, then look up and be almost surprised to see<br/>the familiar world around one, and no dragons or wizards, or whatever one<br/>was reading about.</p><p>I expect the matter of dissonances waking one up may be largely<br/>a matter of familiarity. 17-tet dissonances would be particularly<br/>unfamiliar, and a new dissonance would wake one up. Also of course<br/>it is a lively temperament and not likely to be part. conducive<br/>to trance, and that it is at all perhaps shows there is another<br/>side to 17-tet.</p><p>Anyway, I&apos;m not trying to make trance music, and don&apos;t imagine it<br/>is particularly desirable in itself, except in a context where there<br/>is a point to it, e.g. to heal.</p><p>As a holistic thing, part of a healing context, I can see it may well<br/>be of value, just as sleep and dreaming are healing things too. Or,<br/>to go the other way, I feel your music is beneficial and healing,<br/>so if it sends some people into a trance, I think one can assume<br/>that it will be a beneficial trance.</p><p>However, truth is, I prefer my listeners to hear my music rather<br/>than to go into a trance and miss it all, but may be not quite<br/>getting what a trance is all about when I say that.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=125 href="#125">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>6/7/2001 9:20:35 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;Robert Walker&quot; &lt;robertwalker@n...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I wonder if someone who trances easily needs to be careful about the<br/>&gt; type of music you listen to when driving, if listening to any music<br/>&gt; at all?

Again getting fully absorbed in<br/>something also works for me in the same way.  My suspicion is there<br/>is a chemistry generated in these states that is beneficial for the<br/>body.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; However, truth is, I prefer my listeners to hear my music rather<br/>&gt; than to go into a trance and miss it all, but may be not quite<br/>&gt; getting what a trance is all about when I say that.</p><p>For myself I tend to hear everything much more clearly in an altered<br/>state of consciousness - almost like I can stretch time and have<br/>enough space to hear every little nuance.  I don&apos;t however remember,<br/>or choose to remember, every detail when I&apos;m back in full waking<br/>consciousness, in part I think because the feeling is most precious<br/>to me.  Actually as I read over these words I realize my own personal<br/>goal with music is to be able to express more and more of the beauty<br/>and sacredness I can feel in these states, using my voice in<br/>particular.</p><p>Its fun talking about this stuff with you Robert.</p><p>Mary</p></div><h3><a id=137 href="#137">ðŸ”—</a>David J.

There was a beautiful sythesized choral<br/>piece playing, sounded like angels or something, and I went right out<br/>of my head.  Someone stopped to make a left turn in front of me and by<br/>the time I came to it was too late to do anything.  Rear ended her<br/>big pickup truck with my little Hyundai at about 35 mph, her sitting<br/>dead still.  My tool box was in the back seat on the passenger side,<br/>and smashed almost through the windshield.  If it had been on my side,<br/>I&apos;d have been killed.</p><p>The tape stuck in the player and wouldn&apos;t come out.  Sold the car to a<br/>junk yard and never got to hear the rest of it.</p><p>So, yes, be vvveeeerrryy careful what kinds of music you listen to<br/>while driving, esp. microtonal music.  I always listen to some kind of<br/>music while driving, except mid day when talk radio heats up.  Never<br/>had any problems with Western classical, rock, jazz, bluegrass,<br/>whatever.  Maybe get a little sleepy sometimes during Echoes, or<br/>Hearts of Space, which are two public radio shows featuring &quot;New Age&quot;<br/>music of various kinds.  But microtonal stuff can get very powerful<br/>on the psyche, esp. on first listen.</p><p>David</p></div>
