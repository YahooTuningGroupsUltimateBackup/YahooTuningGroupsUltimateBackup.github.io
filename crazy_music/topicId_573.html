You confine yourself to<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s writings. I discuss precursors, influences,<br/>&gt; causes, effects, problems in reasoning and lack of evidence<br/>&gt; that led one music theorist to try to improve on the work<br/>&gt; of other music theorists.</p><p>Yes, this is all true.  You have done an admirable job of<br/>citing historical sources in support of your argument, and<br/>I thank for summing it up here the way you did.</p><p>BUT... as I have already made clear in my posts, and as<br/>you have still failed to address, my intention in this<br/>debate was *not* to argue your points, but rather to correct<br/>your incorrect and incomplete knowledge of the theoretical<br/>writings and ideas of Schoenberg himself, thus my confinement<br/>to quoting only his work.</p><p>&gt;    And this explains much of the garbled hesitant<br/>&gt; contradictory nature of Schoenberg&apos;s prose.<br/>&gt;    Some of the garbled contradictory quality of<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s writing of course comes from the fact<br/>&gt; that Schoenberg was simple grossly incompetent as<br/>&gt; a writer.</p><p>The nature of Schoenberg&apos;s prose is best explained by his<br/>intense admiration of Karl Kraus, publisher of _Die Fackel_.<br/>Read some of Kraus&apos;s work and you will immediately see<br/>the resemblance.</p><p>&gt;    Clear and concise writing involves getting<br/>&gt; rid of the embedded clauses. It involves throwing<br/>&gt; out the incessant qualifiers and &quot;somewhat&quot;s and &quot;in part&quot;s<br/>&gt; and &quot;on the one hand&quot;s and &quot;even if&quot;s.  These kinds<br/>&gt; of incessant qualifiers, like parasitic vines choking<br/>&gt; a tree to death, tell us that the person who wrote<br/>&gt; the sentence could not decide what he actually wanted<br/>&gt; to say.  A person who constantly festoons his sentences<br/>&gt; with unnecessary qualifiers like &quot;even if&quot; and &quot;in<br/>&gt; part&quot; is telling us that he cannot make up his mind<br/>&gt; which arguments he considers valid, or which facts he<br/>&gt; actually believes in.</p><p>Exactly.  You have no argument from me on that at all.<br/>The reason Schoenberg wrote like this is because he<br/>thought like this.  (No, I&apos;m not psychic... but I have<br/>read numerous accounts of his statements and behavior<br/>when he was in the presence of people such as Mahler;<br/>that&apos;s how I know what he was thinking.)</p><p>Schoenberg tended to look at ideas from every possible<br/>angle, and generally could not bring himself to believe<br/>that there was only &quot;one true&quot; perspective.</p><p>&gt;      You claim, Joe, that I &quot;attempt to &grave;dominate the list&apos;<br/>&gt; with posts that are much longer than what many people here<br/>&gt; are interested in reading [citation: this list&apos;s archives],<br/>&gt; and you have bombarded the Files section with up to 10 or<br/>&gt; so new mp3&apos;s at a time [citation: this list&apos;s archives].<br/>&gt;     &quot;And lest you respond by claiming that I&apos;m &grave;attacking&apos;<br/>&gt; you, I&apos;m not.&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      *Of* *course* you are attacking me, Joe.<br/>&gt;      Please. Your nose is lengthening again.<br/>&gt;      That Pinocchio problem you&apos;ve got, Joe....have to watch that.</p><p>Brian, please explain to me why you consider this to be an<br/>attack.  I paintakingly assembled the statistics of the volume<br/>of kilobytes posted to this list over a 7-week period including<br/>the 2 weeks since you have joined.  I even made a graph of<br/>the volume of posts and pointed out how much was by you, how<br/>much was by me, and how much was by everyone else.  This is<br/>simply the facts, and the facts show that you have posted<br/>*far* more kilobytes to the list in a much shorter period of<br/>time than anyone else here.  Where&apos;s the attack?</p><p>And to my continual exhortation: &quot;Citations, please! -<br/>*I* don&apos;t believe this&quot; or &quot;*I* don&apos;t do this&quot;:</p><p>What I&apos;m obviously (at least I thought it was obvious)<br/>looking for here is not more citations which explain what<br/>&quot;JI moonies&quot; or &quot;musical modernist Branch Davidians&quot; are,<br/>or that they exist, but rather, citations from *my own work*<br/>which demonstrate that I do in fact subscribe to these two<br/>&quot;belief systems&quot;.  You have not provided a single one, and<br/>you can&apos;t, because I don&apos;t, and it&apos;s very easy to find<br/>numerous examples in my writings and sound-files which prove<br/>that I don&apos;t.</p><p>I have done research and composed in just-intonation,<br/>meantone, various equal-temperaments (including 12-, 19-, 22-,<br/>31-, 55-, 72-, and 318-EDO), and other systems that are less<br/>easy to label in such a neat mathematical way (such as Robin<br/>Perry&apos;s &quot;Just-about Intonation&quot;).</p><p>So please refrain from putting me into categories into which<br/>I do not belong.  Thanks.</p><p>-monz</p></div>
