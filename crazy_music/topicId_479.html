I&apos;ve just spent the entire day<br/>and night responding to the accusations you made to me<br/>in your post of Sunday, July 15, 2001 12:45 PM, and came<br/>to exactly the same conclusion.</p><p>I still haven&apos;t finished that one, and now here is another<br/>one from you which requires a response.  This one will be<br/>very brief.  Then I&apos;ll send the other one and _sayonara_.</p><p>------</p><p>&gt;    Joe Monzo has admitted that he has a problem with<br/>&gt; internet addiction. I have watched Joe Monzo sit in<br/>&gt; a closet (where his computer is located) typing<br/>&gt; mathematical minutiae for the Alternative Wanking List<br/>&gt; for hour after hour after hour after hour after hour<br/>&gt; while his girlfriend called out to him to come to<br/>&gt; bed. &quot;In a minute,&quot; Joe replied...and then continued<br/> &gt; typing, and typing, and typing...and typing...and<br/>&gt; typing. I had to leave -- and when I left Joe&apos;s<br/>&gt; apartment, he was still typing, and his girlfriend<br/>&gt; was still calling out to him to come to bed.</p><p>Brian, I spent all day on a response to you because<br/>I felt that it was necessary to reply to your false<br/>accusations about me.  But in truth, I really don&apos;t<br/>give a damn what&apos;s said in public or private about me,<br/>because I know what and who I am and and have enough<br/>confidence in my value to society to not care.</p><p>But you&apos;ve really crossed the line here.  Revealing<br/>these aspects of my private life which you witnessed,<br/>in an archived public forum, is an outright violation<br/>of my ex-girlfriend&apos;s right to privacy.  She values<br/>her privacy far, far more than I care about mine, and<br/>I have been very careful on my website to reveal only<br/>the tiniest bit of information about her and our life<br/>together.</p><p>This was a blatantly wrong thing for you to do.</p><p>--------</p><p>As for Schoenberg, read this and tell me what the hell<br/>is different about what *you* wrote *against him*, because<br/>I don&apos;t see one bit of difference, especially the third<br/>paragraph [this all came from one paragraph - I broke it<br/>up for easier reading]:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Perhaps it is indefensible to try to derive everything<br/>&gt;&gt; that constitutes the physics of harmony from one of the<br/>&gt;&gt; components, say, just from the tone.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Some characteristics can be derived from the tone, however,<br/>&gt;&gt; for the very reason that the constitution of the ear, the<br/>&gt;&gt; organ predetermined to receive tone, at least relates to the<br/>&gt;&gt; constitution of the tone somewhat as do well-fitting concave<br/>&gt;&gt; to convex parts.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; One of the three factors, however, the world of our feelings,<br/>&gt;&gt; so completely eludes precisely controlled investigation that<br/>&gt;&gt; it would be folly to place the same confidence in the few<br/>&gt;&gt; conjectures permitted by observation in this sphere that we<br/>&gt;&gt; place in those conjectures that in other matters are called<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;science&quot;.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; In this sense it is of little consequence whether one starts<br/>&gt;&gt; with a correct hypothesis or a false one.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Sooner or later the one as well as the other will certainly be refuted.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Thus, we can only base our thought on such conjectures as<br/>&gt;&gt; will satisfy our formal necessity for sense and coherence<br/>&gt;&gt; without their being considered natural laws.</p><p>He&apos;s saying here exactly the same things you&apos;ve been saying.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2001 2:37:52 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: monz &lt;joemonz@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:crazy_music@yahoogroups.com">crazy_music@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Monday, July 16, 2001 2:29 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [crazy_music] The arrogant incomepetent ignoramus Arnold<br/>Schoenberg<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Perhaps it is indefensible to try to derive everything<br/>&gt;&gt; that constitutes the physics of harmony from one of the<br/>&gt;&gt; components, say, just from the tone.</p><p>That and its sequel should have had the citation:</p><p>Schoenberg, Arnold.  1911.  _Harmonielehre_, p 16-17.<br/>  English translation: Roy Carter, 1978, _Theory of Harmony_, p 19.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2001 4:12:32 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[Monz wrote:]<br/>&gt;But you&apos;ve really crossed the line here.
