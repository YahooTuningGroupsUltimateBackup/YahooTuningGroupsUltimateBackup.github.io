I wonder if you know, I removed the digests from tuning_gossip. Haven&apos;t actually<br/>&gt; read them, and was told that they weren&apos;t really that great things to propogate,<br/>&gt; plus consideration that there is no implied permission to be able to repost<br/>&gt; messages in this way, since the p.m. archives weren&apos;t open to the public, though<br/>&gt; membership was.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m sorry about what I did; I think now that perhaps it was unwise.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If we did go ahead with this, I think one would need to ask everyone else involved<br/>&gt; if they were happy for their posts to be reposted, and maybe just leave out all<br/>&gt; his posts - as far as I know they were all off topic anyway for the main focus<br/>&gt; of what the list was about.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Another possibility would be to use my program to make an archive out of all the<br/>&gt; digests, and circulate the zip to anyone who wants it who used to belong to<br/>&gt; the PMG.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m told some of the material he posted just possibly might be libelous,<br/>&gt; so not too keen to be involved in propogating it, so I&apos;d leave his posts<br/>&gt; out of the zip too, just to be on the safe side.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s one thing to provide a place where someone can speak freely. I feel it is<br/>&gt; quite another to be involved in reproducing everything that they have said,<br/>&gt; if it is slanderous or libelous. I don&apos;t know myself as I&apos;m not interested<br/>&gt; in it enough to keep going beyond a few sentences, better things to<br/>&gt; read I think.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ve got digests 0 and 5 - 26, all except digests 1 to 4.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, that is all to do with practicalities.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What to do is up for debate!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Robert<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>&gt; <a href="mailto:crazy_music-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">crazy_music-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
