The whole post: well<br/>answered, very helpful stuff with lots of wonderful detail.  Thank<br/>you.</p><p>&gt;     As a result, each particular synthesizer, like an<br/>&gt; orchestral instrument, earns a special niche in a studio<br/>&gt; composer&apos;s sonic armamentarium.  &quot;Simplifying&quot; a studio setup<br/>&gt; by eliminating this or that synth in favor of some handy-dandy<br/>&gt; Swiss Army Knife software synth or sampler typically means:<br/>&gt; collapsing down that rich pallette of sonic colors produced<br/>&gt; by different types of synths into anindustrial gray-on-gray<br/>&gt; of General Midi mud or algorithmic synthesis mud or (you<br/>&gt; name the particular overarching process) mud.</p><p>Nicely said.  Whatever works.  If it ain&apos;t broke, don&apos;t fix it.</p><p>&gt; As you can tell from my persistent use<br/>&gt; of an 8088 PC XT as my main sequencing computer, obsoletismo<br/>&gt; remains my watchword.</p><p>Oh, please come to the bleeding edge and suffer with the rest of<br/>us. :-)  Seriously, I&apos;m not always too far &quot;in front&quot; of you,<br/>technologically.  In addition to my Windows 98 machine with new Sound<br/>Font sound card and subwoofer-boosted Alpine sound (which I must,<br/>alas, share with my dear wife), I have a 286 running DOS 6.something,<br/>equipped with an old version of PowerTracks Pro - a $30 program that<br/>is relatively full featured and works just great.  In fact, it works<br/>better under DOS than under Windows: faster, easier to navigate, more<br/>stable.  Can&apos;t remember the last time it crashed in DOS.  I&apos;ve thought<br/>several times about upgrading it to a 486 or early Pentium with a<br/>newer, graphical interface sequencer.  But it&apos;s just not worth it yet.<br/> It works perfectly fine for 99 percent of what I want to do.</p><p>Thanks for clarifying about harmony and fifths.  Earlier I had missed<br/>the context somehow.</p><p>Also enjoyed the heck out of part one of eleven.  I hope to get caught<br/>up and read more parts soon.</p><p>David</p></div>
