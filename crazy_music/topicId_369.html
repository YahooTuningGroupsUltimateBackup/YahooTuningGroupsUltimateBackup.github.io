I&apos;ll buy the idea that descriptive music theories aren&apos;t worth much,<br/>and that people who say &quot;tuning X is unpalatable&quot; for any X out of context<br/>are wrong...  But you&apos;ll need to prove the statement above.  I&apos;m not<br/>convinced by a bald assertion.  Incest taboo -- of one kind or another -- is<br/>pretty pervasive all over the world.  There are notable known exceptions in,<br/>various time-space loci, which usually involve royalty (&quot;marrying-in&quot;,<br/>anthropologically speaking, can be seen as a means of conserving wealth and<br/>power, and is not engaged in by &quot;normal&quot; people in any society).  I assume<br/>you have documentary evidence to back up this claim?</p><p>Now... McLaren also went on a pretty long tirade about bullies and bullying.<br/> Looking in from the sidelines here, I have to say that his tactic of<br/>massive uploads and extended verbal rants is nearly indistinguishable from<br/>bullying -- especially the tone of vehemence and accusation.  It&apos;s a classic<br/>tactic on these internet mailing lists, for someone to &quot;win&quot; an argument by<br/>the volume of their postings and drown out everything else by their shouting.<br/> That&apos;s what it looks like to me.  (Somewhere out there, someone coined a<br/>law about this mail list phenomenon, but I can&apos;t put my finger on it.)</p><p>Maybe Monz and others who know McLaren might see this all as evidence of his<br/>sense of humor.  But as yet, I can&apos;t see that.  Much of it looks like more<br/>bullying and unwarranted ad-hominem attacks, and I have a hard time spending<br/>more than a few minutes with most of his postings.  More brevity and less<br/>character bashing would do much to help me see whether his points are valid.<br/>Nobody else around here, even at their harshest, seems to appear as quite<br/>such a bully as the one person who&apos;s so loudly decrying the behavior.  Where<br/>have I heard that before?</p><p>Thanks to Margo Schulter for her continuing pacifism.  She quotes Erv Wilson:</p><p>&gt;  1. ERV WILSON&apos;S ADVICE: &quot;Talk about what you&apos;re doing, not<br/>&gt;  about what you&apos;re not doing.&quot;</p><p>To that, I would add: talk about what you&apos;re doing without talking about<br/>what others on the list are or aren&apos;t doing.  I&apos;m sorry I have to single<br/>McLaren out, but the posts have been annoying because they have so much<br/>apparent wrath and are so voluminous.</p><p>What I&apos;ve been doing lately is working, actually.  Last week I wrote a play.<br/> I may write some music for it.  If I do, it&apos;ll be in some low ET like 8 or<br/>9...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
