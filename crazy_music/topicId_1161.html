It seems simple; we can<br/>all sing or at least recognize a major scale. But<br/>through a survey touching upon seminal moments in the<br/>evolution of music, Stuart Isacoff shows exactly how we<br/>came up with the collection of notes that is<br/>fundamental to everything we know as Western music --<br/>from Beethoven to the Beatles. The basic story<br/>progresses from the ancient Greeks&apos; mathematically<br/>devised system of tuning to what we know today: the<br/>series of white and black keys on the piano. What we<br/>find is that musical possibilities themselves have<br/>radically changed over time, depending on how our<br/>instruments have been tuned.</p><p>In addition to explaining the basics of Western tuning,<br/>Isacoff leads us on fascinating excursions through<br/>ideas and events that have governed cultural values<br/>from the Middle Ages to the present, showing how these<br/>things have shaped what has been considered beautiful,<br/>possible, or even heretical in music, as well as in<br/>painting, architecture, mathematics, physics, and<br/>theology. Through these explorations, Isacoff creates a<br/>context in which the story of Western tuning can be<br/>understood in relation to the central intellectual and<br/>ideological currents running throughout the history of<br/>the West.</p><p>Temperament does require a very basic understanding of<br/>music (if you can pick out a scale on a keyboard,<br/>you&apos;ll be fine). That said, Isacoff&apos;s explanation of<br/>what &quot;tuning&quot; is and how it developed is engaging and<br/>remarkably clear.

He<br/>addresses the development of equal temperament in<br/>chapters ranging from the ancient Greek origins of<br/>Western tuning through discoveries by 16th- and<br/>17th-century astronomers and physicists to today&apos;s<br/>composers and performers. His fascinating side paths on<br/>how the Roman Catholic Church dealt with scientific<br/>progress, the genesis of various musical instruments,<br/>his sojourns in China, and the clashes between major<br/>players such as Galileo and Zarlino add flashes of<br/>drama. The writing is geared to those with little<br/>background in music, but Isacoff&apos;s arguments can also<br/>be appreciated by informed readers. A distracting use<br/>of sentence fragments is one of the only drawbacks to<br/>this impressive effort. The up-to-date bibliography<br/>includes classics in the field and new research.<br/>Isacoff&apos;s book is a worthy complement to Owen<br/>Jorgensen&apos;s massive treatise Tuning (Michigan State<br/>Univ., 1991) and is recommended for all libraries.<br/>(Index not seen.)

When a<br/>Renaissance musician tuned a musical instrument<br/>according to the dictates of the Church-approved<br/>ancient Greeks, it could be played only in certain keys<br/>and was limited to intervals of the octave, fifth, and<br/>fourth. This was not a problem until keyboard<br/>instruments came into prominence and composers made<br/>increasing use of the third and sixth intervals.<br/>Unpleasant sonorities resulted from the old tuning, and<br/>compositions were rendered unplayable. Kepler, Newton,<br/>and Rousseau were among the period&apos;s leading thinkers<br/>who took part in the search for a better tuning system.<br/>Many elaborate and convoluted solutions were proposed,<br/>but equal temperament was the least elegant and most<br/>pragmatic, dividing the 12 tones within the octave into<br/>12 equal intervals. Flying as it did in the face of<br/>tradition, this solution unsurprisingly drew fierce<br/>opposition, but it ultimately prevailed. Painting a<br/>vast backdrop for his arcane subject, Isacoff often<br/>strays too far afield. He devotes page after page to<br/>other admittedly fascinating intellectual issues, from<br/>perspective to planetary motion, and although he writes<br/>well and lovingly about almost all of them, it&apos;s<br/>jarring when he realizes he must return to the matter<br/>at hand and thus wrenches the narrative back to the<br/>more mundane topic of temperament. And he betrays an<br/>anachronistically secular view when he describes early<br/>harmonic compositions as the result of &quot;bored monks in<br/>search of amusement&quot; without providing any evidence of<br/>this alleged boredom. Most difficult to fathom is<br/>Isacoff&apos;s mere passing reference to Bach&apos;s<br/>&quot;Well-Tempered Clavier,&quot; surely the most eloquent and<br/>staggeringly ingenious endorsement of equal temperament<br/>and surely worthy of a few more lines of commentary.<br/>Well-meaning but disappointing: a history in search of<br/>a subject.

But over time<br/>skeptics came to understand that those rules limited<br/>harmonic possibilities. In Temperament, we see the<br/>traditionalists and the innovators battling across the<br/>centuries, engaging great thinkers like Newton, Kepler,<br/>and Descartes as well as musicians, craftsmen, church<br/>leaders, and heads of state. At the heart of their<br/>dispute is the question of how the tones of a musical<br/>scale should be selected.</p><p>The breakthrough came in the eighteenth century, when<br/>the modern keyboard was given perfect musical symmetry<br/>through a tuning of equal temperament, each pitch<br/>reliably equidistant from the ones that precede and<br/>follow it.

Its range, from bass to treble, is as large<br/>as an orchestra&apos;s. It allows ten tones-sometimes even<br/>more-to be struck simultaneously, and holds them in the<br/>air at a pianist&apos;s will. The piano can growl and sing<br/>and beat time. It can render arid fugues and<br/>impressionist waterfalls with equal naturalness. And,<br/>unlike the ungrateful French horn or the finicky oboe,<br/>if you keep it in tune, it will be an obedient servant.<br/>But the principle that truly underlies the piano&apos;s<br/>versatility is hidden beneath the geometry of its white<br/>and black keys.</p><p>Clusters of two blacks, then three, then two, and so<br/>on, form a repeating pattern above a solid row of<br/>whites. When one&apos;s eye has become accustomed to the<br/>terrain, the alternating groupings signal the names of<br/>each note on the keyboard. There are only twelve<br/>different ones (each tied to a letter of the alphabet),<br/>and in our modern tuning they are built in equidistant<br/>steps, like a well-made ladder.</p><p>This arrangement produces wondrous results: Through it,<br/>a Chopin prelude can gently weep across the keys;<br/>Debussy&apos;s perfumed phrases can swirl in gentle clouds;<br/>Webern can set in motion intricate strings of melody,<br/>like threads of glistening pearls.</p><p>All of this is possible only because the modern<br/>keyboard is a design in perfect symmetry-each pitch is<br/>reliably, unequivocally equidistant from the ones that<br/>precede and follow it. This tuning allows a musical<br/>pattern begun on one note to be duplicated when<br/>starting on any other; it creates a musical universe in<br/>which the relationships between musical tones are<br/>reliably, uniformly consistent. Playing a piano for<br/>which this was not true would be like playing a game of<br/>chess in which the rules changed from moment to moment.</p><p>Yet, that is precisely what many European musicians<br/>practicing before the nineteenth century demanded of<br/>their instruments. In fact, for hundreds of years,<br/>suggestions that our modern system be used were taken<br/>as a call to battle: Musicians, craftsmen, church<br/>officials, heads of state, and philosophers fought<br/>heatedly against the introduction of this<br/>equal-temperament tuning as something both unnatural<br/>and ugly. When Galileo&apos;s father, Vincenzo Galilei,<br/>supported it as an ideal as early as 1581, he promptly<br/>became embroiled in a feud with Gioseffo Zarlino, one<br/>of the most influential music theorists of the day.<br/>(Sensing a good thing, Chu Tsai-y&uuml;, a prince of the<br/>Ming dynasty, soon after attributed the concept to the<br/>work of Huai Nan Tzu in 122 b.c.e.)</p><p>The seventeenth-century instrument-maker Jean Denis-an<br/>advisor to Father Marin Mersenne, philosopher Ren&eacute;<br/>Descartes&apos;s most trusted authority on science and<br/>math-rejected today&apos;s approach as &quot;quite wretched.&quot;<br/>Denis&apos;s Treatise on Harpsichord Tuning was published in<br/>1643, the year that a pupil of Galileo&apos;s, Evangelista<br/>Torricelli, conducted world-shaking experiments in<br/>atmospheric pressure, overturning essential elements of<br/>medieval cosmology. Though radical changes in worldview<br/>were erupting all around him, Denis remained<br/>steadfastly loyal to an old tuning system in which the<br/>musical distances between notes were determinedly<br/>inconsistent, forming a minefield of &quot;wolf sounds&quot; on<br/>his keyboard-notes so dissonant they reminded listeners<br/>of the howling of wolves.</p><p>Harpsichords and organs (precursors of the piano) thus<br/>tuned were capable of producing harmonies of magical,<br/>uncorrupted sweetness in one moment and-as musicians<br/>attempted to duplicate them while navigating the spans<br/>of their keyboards-of earsplitting clashes the next.<br/>Composers were prisoners of these torturous<br/>practicalities, as were vocalists and instrumentalists<br/>who tried to join in. Yet the resistance to a remedy<br/>that we find perfectly acceptable today-the tuning of<br/>equal temperament-was so powerful, the idea was for<br/>generations almost unspeakable.</p><p>The crux of the problem can be traced to the ancient<br/>Greeks, who defined music&apos;s most beautiful sounds as<br/>arising from inviolable mathematical relationships-the<br/>fingerprints of the gods. These were the proportions<br/>through which two separate tones could entwine to form<br/>a delightful union. Centuries after Pythagoras<br/>conceived of the notion, the great astronomer and music<br/>theorist Johannes Kepler restated the idea eloquently:<br/>&quot;Geometry existed before the creation, is coeternal<br/>with the mind of God, is God himself. . . .&quot; Musical<br/>harmony was that geometry made sensual, and was not to<br/>be toyed with. And yet . . .</p><p>As the art of music evolved, a startling paradox arose<br/>that threatened to undermine the entire arrangement.<br/>When harpsichords or organs were tuned so that they<br/>could consistently produce sounds corresponding to one<br/>of the venerable formulas, they were rendered incapable<br/>of playing the others. No instrument with fixed,<br/>unbending notes such as a piano can accommodate them<br/>all. Thus, certain combinations of tones that should<br/>have sounded sweet and placid could, on an early<br/>keyboard instrument, become sour and ragged. In search<br/>of a solution, musicians began to temper, or alter,<br/>their instrument&apos;s tunings away from the ancient<br/>ideals. The final solution-today&apos;s equal<br/>temperament-abandoned most of the revered musical<br/>proportions altogether.</p><p>Acceptance did not come easily. Critics claimed the<br/>resulting music had been robbed of its beauty and<br/>emotional impact; supporters countered that since all<br/>things are subjective, human ears and minds would learn<br/>to adapt. The arguments, however, went well beyond<br/>musical aesthetics. Equal temperament represented an<br/>assault on an idea that had gripped thinkers in nearly<br/>every field as a powerful metaphor for a universe ruled<br/>by mathematical law.</p><p>Saint Augustine found in music&apos;s magical proportions<br/>God&apos;s revealed plan for the building of his churches.<br/>Renaissance philosophers sought in them the secrets of<br/>obtaining life from the heavens; composers yearned for<br/>the power they had bestowed on ancient musicians to<br/>tame wild beasts, seduce the celestial spirits, even<br/>lure trees to the surface from beneath the sheltering<br/>earth. Kepler found in music&apos;s time-honored proportions<br/>the rules governing the motion of planets in the sky.<br/>And Isaac Newton matched the relationships these<br/>proportions established between pitches in a musical<br/>scale to the arrangement of colors formed by sunlight<br/>passing through a prism.</p><p>Music&apos;s prized proportions permeated not only the inner<br/>sanctums of the church, but the workshops of great<br/>artists like Filippo Brunelleschi and Leonardo da<br/>Vinci. They became entangled in the world of scientific<br/>inquiry-engaging the imaginations of such luminaries as<br/>Galileo, Kepler, Descartes, Newton, and Christiaan<br/>Huygens. They fed debates between the French<br/>encyclopedists, challenging the rhetorical skills of<br/>Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Jean d&apos;Alembert,<br/>and Jean-Philippe Rameau on questions such as &quot;What is<br/>&apos;art&apos;?&quot; &quot;What is &apos;truth&apos;?&quot; and &quot;What is &apos;natural&apos;?&quot;</p><p>They spurred strange musical inventions from remarkable<br/>figures like the sixteenth-century avant-garde composer<br/>Nicola Vicentino, Mersenne, and Juan Caramuel y<br/>Lobkowitz, a Spanish mathematician, professor of<br/>theology, and military engineer at the court of<br/>Ferdinand III in Prague. And they instigated the<br/>creation of countless tuning systems in an incessant<br/>negotiation between the old ways and the forces of<br/>change. Along the way, they pointed up the conceits and<br/>follies of generations of theologians, musicians,<br/>philosophers, and scholars who insisted that the<br/>proportions in the mind of God must fit in the mind of<br/>man.</p><p>The general acceptance of equal temperament led to some<br/>of the most exquisite music ever written. Why the<br/>resistance to it lasted so long, and how it was<br/>gradually overcome, is a story that encompasses the<br/>most crucial elements of Western culture-social<br/>history, religion, philosophy, art, science, economics,<br/>and musical evolution-during a period when Europe was<br/>struggling to give birth to the modern age. This book<br/>tells that story.</p><p>It is a tale that includes &quot;temperament&quot; in all its<br/>diverse meanings: from the elements that shape the<br/>temperament, or character, of pivotal thinkers; to<br/>endless efforts to temper-or transform-the material<br/>world into something more desirable; to the practice of<br/>tempering, or altering, the purest, most beautiful<br/>harmonies, following the startling revelation that in<br/>certain situations they must be reshaped or they will<br/>transform music, Jekyll-and-Hyde-like, into something<br/>grotesque.</p><p>This last definition, though arcane sounding, marks a<br/>profound moment in cultural history. Temperaments,<br/>settling like tracks along the winding path of Western<br/>civilization, unfettered the engine of musical<br/>progress. Once freed, and fueled by the sparks of those<br/>most human of qualities-imagination and passion-musical<br/>art, with religion, politics, and science in tow,<br/>chugged its way inescapably toward our own era.</p></div>
