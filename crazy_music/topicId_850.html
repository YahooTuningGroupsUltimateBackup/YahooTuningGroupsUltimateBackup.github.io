I think he wrote it myself but some academic<br/>dude did some kind of analysis where he claimed it<br/>wasn&apos;t really in the proper style or what have you and<br/>tried to attribute it to a pal of JSB&apos;s or some such.<br/>bviously trying to make a name for himself by being<br/>controversial. Along with the claims that the works of<br/>Shakespeare were by someone else, etc. Then for a while<br/>it became fashionable to claim that JSB didn&apos;t really<br/>write it among all the fashionable young music<br/>theorists etc.</p><p>I introduced it like that so that I wouldn&apos;t get the<br/>silly &quot;but he didn&apos;t really write it, you should read<br/>so and so&apos;s article that proves he didn&apos;t&quot; claims from<br/>the PhD types.</p><p>But let me leap frog all the cranks out there:</p><p>TH. Jefferson did not write the Declaration of<br/>Independence. It was Voltaire.</p><p>Leo Tolstoy did not write War and Peace. It was<br/>Johannes Kepler. He wrote it in 1628 and Tolstoy<br/>just changed the names and details around. Why,<br/>I even have a first edition of the Latin!</p><p>Herman Melville did not write Moby Dick. It was a seven<br/>year old boy living in Helsinki who did it, writing<br/>down an old traditional Finnish fishing fable his<br/>great-uncle told him.</p><p>Harry Partch was no even a composer! He stole the<br/>scores and instruments from a Pacific Islander hobo<br/>named Franston Pillsbody. All those pieces have been<br/>performed in the Solomon islands for centuries.</p><p>Julius Caesar never lived. The entire history of the<br/>&apos;so-called&apos; Roman Republic and Empire are all an<br/>elaborate hoax. Italy is not even a country, actually!<br/>Surprising but true!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
