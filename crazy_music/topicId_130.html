One might describe them as having a<br/>&gt; pleasantly foggy or almost Debussyan quality, inviting a kind of<br/>&gt; &quot;neo-Gothic Impressionism.&quot;[18]</p><p>&gt; Accordingly, an idiom known as &quot;Fibonacci drift&quot;[19] features two<br/>&gt; upper voices moving in fourths above a sustained lowest note,<br/>&gt; &quot;drifting&quot; around a sonority with a supraminor or Phi-sixth plus a<br/>&gt; supraminor third, in the e-based tuning a rounded 0-341-837 cents.<br/>&gt; Here is an example of Fibonacci drift, illustrating one kind of<br/>&gt; transitional progression for returning to a &quot;usual&quot; neo-Gothic style,<br/>&gt; with the rhythm possibly best expressed as a mixture of 3/4 and 2/4:</p><p>&gt; (3/4)             (2/4)<br/>&gt;   1    2  +   3   + | 1   +  2   + | 1    2   | 1    2 ||<br/>&gt;   F#4     G4  F#4 F4  F#4 G4 F#4 F4  F#4  F4    F#4<br/>&gt;   C#4     D4  C#4 C4  C#4 D4 C#4 C4  C#4        B3<br/>&gt;   Bb3                                           B3</p><p>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/ebphi001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/ebphi001.mid</a>&gt;<br/>....</p><p>It&apos;s great to be able to hear what you are talking about.</p><p>I just go through your posts first playing the midi clips and enjoying<br/>them, then go back and read some of the details about them.</p><p>Also enjoyed your more recent one on 24-tet progressions,<br/>and was nice to play the 12-tet one, then the 24-tet version,<br/>and compare.</p><p><a href="/tuning/topicId_24507.html#24507">/tuning/topicId_24507.html#24507</a></p><p>Coming over fine on my soundcard.</p><p>Thanks again,</p><p>Robert</p></div>
