When he<br/>says 5-limit JI, he means 5-limit JI, and not an adaptive tuning<br/>based on 5-limit JI which distributes the commas.  His whole point<br/>is that rendering Eurocentric &quot;common-practice&quot; music in 5-limit JI<br/>doesn&apos;t work because those composers wrote that music with the<br/>intention that the commas would be distributed in some form of<br/>temperament.  Unless the piece happened to avoid bumping up against<br/>any commas (as does Pachelbel&apos;s Canon, which is why Herman Miller&apos;s<br/>JI versions of that work so well), a straight JI version would have<br/>commatic shifts all over the place, which would make the melodic<br/>lines sound weird and out-of-tune.</p><p>The feedback you get on how good 5-limit *adaptive*-JI sounds<br/>for this repertoire doesn&apos;t hold for 5-limit *straight*-JI.<br/>(of course you know that... I&apos;m just clarifying what&apos;s been<br/>written here in case others don&apos;t follow.)</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>jdstarrett@...</h3><span>7/9/2001 7:11:02 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;monz&quot; &lt;joemonz@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; John, you really have to keep your adaptive-tuning bias in mind<br/>here.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Of course Brian is talking about no distribution at all.
