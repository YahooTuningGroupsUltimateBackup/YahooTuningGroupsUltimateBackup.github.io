But my<br/>&gt; usual use of these is that they&apos;re a part or parts that are nested<br/>&gt; into the composite of combined tuning pieces.</p><p>I&apos;ll look forward to hearing them.</p><p>&gt; Nice job showing everyone some of the mixolydian&apos;s sweetness in the<br/>&gt; midi which should clearly line up with the mood I described as 7-limit<br/>&gt; bathed in the ancestral genealogy of 20&apos;s 5 equal.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; To me these are like normal diatonics crossed through with a sort of<br/>&gt; Sufi like sweetness.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, thanks for checking them out.</p><p>I&apos;d be interested to hear pieces to bring out more of the gamelan like<br/>quality of this scale too - I think it does have some of that as well, and<br/>would&apos;t be too much of a surprise given the closeness of some Slendro<br/>scales to 5 equal.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
