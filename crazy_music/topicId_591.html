He<br/>mentions stuff with 53 equal, stuff from &quot;a hard night...&quot;,<br/>something about a chaconne, none of which seem to be in the<br/>&quot;Files&quot; section.  I probably missed a crucial post.  Can<br/>anyone point me in the right direction?</p><p>() Between McLaren and JdL: &quot;preference&quot; is not a scientific<br/>quantity in this context.  The best experiments in psychology<br/>are seldom able to give insight into &quot;preference&quot;, and all of<br/>the musicological studies I&apos;ve seen cited which claim to do so<br/>are absolutely laughable.  So, John probably shouldn&apos;t have<br/>said what McLaren claims he said.  However, in John&apos;s defense<br/>I will claim that:</p><p>        () I can hear the difference between John&apos;s retuned<br/>           sequences and their original tunings, and I like<br/>           the retunings very much, and I am not the only<br/>           such person.</p><p>        () If you play people, whatever age and nationality,<br/>           different chords (with any normal musical timbre you<br/>           like) and ask them to remember the chords, and quiz<br/>           them later, they will identify the ones approximating<br/>           just ratios with greater accuracy than the rest.  If<br/>           you give people a tunable pitch generator (oscillator,<br/>           monochord, etc.) and ask them to tune certain intervals,<br/>           their accuracy will be much better when the target is<br/>           near a just interval, for normal musical timbres.</p><p>           McLaren may predictably respond that 99.44% of timbres<br/>           in the universe are not harmonic.  So what?  Non-harmonic<br/>           timbres do not convey an un-ambiguous sense of pitch, and<br/>           are seldom the primary ingredients for the type of music<br/>           most of us are out to make.  On-the-fence timbres such as<br/>           used by Sethares are non-existent in nature, and are as<br/>           bad at conveying pitch as they may be said to be non-<br/>           harmonic, in my experience.  McLaren&apos;s claim that harmonic<br/>           timbres are not to be found in nature is nonsense --<br/>           almost perfect harmonic spectra can easily be found in<br/>           the human voice, bowed strings, brass, reeds.  A great<br/>           coincidence, surely, that this is a nearly exhaustive list<br/>           of ingredients for an orchestra.  Percussion the<br/>           exception, they are usually tuned only very roughly, or<br/>           not at all.</p><p>           McLaren may predictably respond that playing intervals<br/>           for people in a lab supplies us with no insight into<br/>           music.  There is truth to this.  I will claim, however,<br/>           that it requires substantially more training for<br/>           listeners to distinguish between, say, different works of<br/>           atonal serialism than it does for them to distinguish<br/>           different works of common practice music.  I will claim<br/>           that people have better success, in general, extracting<br/>           parts from music made mostly of just intervals than from<br/>           music made mostly of non-just intervals.  I will claim<br/>           that arguably the most successful music in history<br/>           (western common-practice music) has been made, to an<br/>           astounding extent, of just intervals.</p><p>() Between McLaren and Monz.  Joe, your midi files are great.<br/>Brian, midi files are a great way to distribute music, and I<br/>haven&apos;t heard Joe using any of the excuses you mention when<br/>people don&apos;t like his stuff.</p><p>You both make very interesting music.  Monz, your ideas are<br/>underdeveloped, and your output too small.  McLaren, your<br/>ideas are random, and your output too large.  McLaren, if<br/>you are willing to submit your work as an entry in the genre<br/>of experimental electronic music, then it may safely be<br/>considered a definitive mastery.  Experimental electronic music<br/>generally sucks, though, and if for whatever reason you are<br/>unwilling to accept this as your genre, you must face the fact<br/>that your opinion of your work may indeed be the highest one<br/>around.  I&apos;m in much the same position with my own work, and<br/>I do accept it, but I don&apos;t make a habit of blasting other<br/>people&apos;s work to their face.</p><p>Of whatever else Brian says about Monz, I have no way to access<br/>the truth.  I certainly don&apos;t see Brian&apos;s post as spiteful,<br/>though, and I do not see a basis for Robert Walker&apos;s suggestion<br/>of an apology.  If somebody thinks I have an internet addiction,<br/>I&apos;d expect them to tell me.  In public?  Well, maybe Brian has<br/>an addiction to sociopathy.  I&apos;m probably in that boat too.</p><p>-Carl</p></div><h3><a id=601 href="#601">ðŸ”—</a>carl@...</h3><span>7/19/2001 10:03:10 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; &lt;&lt;Brian, midi files are a great way to distribute music,&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Just my opinion of course, but general midi files are probably the<br/>&gt; absolute worst way I&apos;ve ever heard to distribute music -- just<br/>&gt; horrible.</p><p>Not as a sole means of distribution, or for the general public.<br/>But for a group like this they&apos;re great.</p><p>They are small to transfer and store, and they function as somewhat<br/>of a score -- even as a good score if the composer was careful.  In<br/>some ways they even sound better than mp3.  Psychoacoustic<br/>masking, the silent killer... Seriously, the hollow-sounding, high-<br/>frequency cutting, subsonically distorted 128Kbps mp3 does real<br/>damage to listening.</p><p>We all know that timbre is important to music, but consider...</p><p>() What if the composer works in General MIDI?  There&apos;s a good<br/>chance you&apos;ll get very close to what he intended.  To do better,<br/>the composer can reference a popular piece of hardware or a<br/>sound font.</p><p>() Good listeners should be able to hear the notes, and judge<br/>just the notes.</p><p>() The listener can even change the timbres until they suit!</p><p>&gt; I was recently reading a review of Steven Spielberg&apos;s recent film<br/>&gt; &quot;A.I.&quot;, and in the review Spielberg&apos;s prolific output was<br/>&gt; contrasted with Stanley Kubrick&apos;s rather stingy one by noting that<br/>&gt; speed is often the enemy of art. This is a sentiment that rings<br/>&gt; true for me as well... not always, but more often than not.</p><p>I&apos;m not sure.  Kubrick was about a prolific in his time as<br/>Spielberg, he just burned out.  If anything, a lack of speed<br/>killed AI and Eyes Wide Shut -- Kubrick spent 20 years on them.</p><p>Spielberg&apos;s problem is his manipulation of his audience.  All the<br/>little movie moments put into every film... the smiles, the sighs...<br/>Kubrick just presents a thing and let&apos;s his audience judge.  His<br/>formula is simple: find a great story, depict it with brilliant<br/>visual art, while playing proven classical music in the background.<br/>A vertical approach, Kubrick is a visual artist.  Spielberg works<br/>horizontally -- a one-man Disney using live actors.  AI was an<br/>abomination.</p><p>&gt; Art is in the details, the care that one takes in stamping that<br/>&gt; thing as their own... expediency runs in the exact opposite<br/>&gt; direction, and midi is expedience personified.</p><p>Sorry to be so contrary, but MIDI is no such thing.  Like anything<br/>else, doing it right takes time.  To get expression while keeping<br/>your score intact is incredibly difficult.  So much so, I&apos;ll<br/>wager fewer than 1% of authors bother.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
