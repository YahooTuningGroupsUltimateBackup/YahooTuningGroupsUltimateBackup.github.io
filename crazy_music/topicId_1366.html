There is a special delicacy and delight which I cannot quite put<br/>into words, but I love.</p><p>There was a cadence around 2:12 that sounded very familiar to me,<br/>maybe classical 12th-13th century European -- but very nice, in any<br/>event.</p><p>A lot of what I&apos;m doing now is starting to learn the radif, something<br/>which I know people spend many years in doing. Thank you for your<br/>music in many styles, a tribute to the people of Iran and all the<br/>people of the world.</p><p>By the way, I am having fun imagining how at some point Baran and<br/>Annika might play in an ensemble. I wonder who might sing, or play tar<br/>or santur.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
