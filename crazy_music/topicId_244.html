He<br/>missed this detail, that detail, and the other detail.  Oh yeah, his<br/>central thesis was right on target, but let&apos;s not focus on that, let&apos;s<br/>trash him instead!</p><p>Not to say that Helmholtz should be deified, not to say that he didn&apos;t<br/>miss something he might have seen even in the restricted realm of what<br/>was available when he was alive, but still: this trashing is wholly<br/>unjustified, IMHO.</p><p>Helmholtz hated 12-tET, and I say hooray for that!  12-tET &quot;sucks&quot;, as<br/>I so indelicately put in on the now defunct Practical Microtonality<br/>list.  12-tET is the embodiment of anti-theory, for which there are<br/>still proponents in the 21st century, it would seem.  The condemnation<br/>of 12-tET to me represents at its core the triumph of tunings that<br/>consider the wonder of, and beauty of, consonance.  In this sense,<br/>Helmholtz, whatever his errors in detail, is a courageous man standing<br/>against the swell of stupidity disguised as &quot;scientific progress&quot;.</p><p>Yes, let us correct Helmholtz&apos;s errors.  I&apos;m sure Helmholtz himself<br/>would applaud these corrections, since he was truly concerned with<br/>beauty.  Gratuitous trashings reflect more upon those who perpetrate<br/>them than upon those to whom they are directed.  History will sort it<br/>all out, I have no doubt.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
