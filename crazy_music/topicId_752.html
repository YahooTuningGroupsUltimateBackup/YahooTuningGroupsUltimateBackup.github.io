The octaves (relationships between Nth partials<br/>and 2Nth partials) are the strongest spectral determinant of<br/>stretched tuning matching stretched timbre. Piano tuners learn to<br/>tune 2:1 octaves in the high register, 4:2 octaves lower, 6:3 octaves<br/>lower still . . . where the numbers indicate the partials being<br/>matched.</p></div>
