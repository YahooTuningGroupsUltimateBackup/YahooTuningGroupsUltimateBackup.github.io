A new poll has been created for the<br/>crazy_music group:</p><p>Which microtonal life scenarios do you<br/>find appealing</p><p>  o I am living in a log cabin with no electricity, communing with nature, singing with the birds and banging sticks together and playing my drums.<br/>  o I am living in an ivory tower, surrounded by quills and parchment. There is a harpsichord with a split key 16 note keyboard in the corner. My patron really respects my work and the public seems to enjoy my recitals.<br/>  o I am living in the Big City where I play the downtown scene and am a well known and respected local microtonalist. If you can dig it, man!<br/>  o I am living on a commune that practices biointensive organic farming, growing all my own food, disconnected from the grid, but with a composter that turns trash and cow manure into methane for use in the gas turbine that fuels my dream studio setup.<br/>  o I am living in a Monastary or Tent in the Himalayan mountains where I raise onions and practice throat singing and chanting and the tritone is my favourite interval. I have mastered the art of bilocation and am one with all that is.<br/>  o I live in my tour bus, travelling from town to town performing hard core microtonal punk music to screaming throngs of fans. I insist that they remove all the brown M&amp;Ms because that tells me that they at least read the contract.<br/>  o I work in my million dollar home studio in the suburbs of an upscale beachtown composing alien drinking songs for TV space operas. Last year I won an Emmy!<br/>  o I am living in an ivory tower, surrounded by advanced computers and thirteen dimensional realtime VR diagramming software. A neural interface automatically translates my thoughts into MP3 files which are made available instantly for downloading into the cell phones of Topless Islanders, Nomadic Ubekistani Goatherders and African Pygmies.</p><p>To vote, please visit the following web page:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/polls">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/polls</a></p><p>Note: Please do not reply to this message.
