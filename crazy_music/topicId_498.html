I was intrigued to see her come up<br/>on MP3 a while back.  She seems to regularly update.</p><p>If you like khayal singers, my couple of favorites are Parween Sultana &amp;<br/>Shruti Sadolikar...  Also Shweta Jhaveri, who hangs out in this area a lot<br/>(Bay Area).  Saw her in concert twice last year.  Awesome.  She has a couple<br/>of nice albums out.  Check <a href="http://www.khazana.com">www.khazana.com</a>... It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve<br/>ordered from them; just noticed their web site has been revamped.</p><p>Speaking of microtonality &amp; singers... I ran across an album called &quot;Royal<br/>Court Music of Thailand&quot; recently that has some very interesting microtonal<br/>(female) singing on it.  It&apos;s Smithsonian Folkways SF CD #40413.  Much of the<br/>first track is kind of repetitive metallophone/bamboo-o-phone stuff with a<br/>lot of gratuititous and moderately unpleasant glissandi.  If you skip that,<br/>the rest of the album is quite nice and has some interesting melodic micro<br/>motion...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=544 href="#544">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>7/18/2001 11:12:40 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., jstarret@c... wrote:<br/>&gt; I&apos;m no expert on Indian music, but this vocalist sounds really good<br/>to<br/>&gt; me: <a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/5/veena_sahasrabuddhe.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/5/veena_sahasrabuddhe.html</a></p><p>Thank you for this link.

They&apos;re in Minneapolis. ;-)  I&apos;ve ordered over a dozen<br/>recordings from them and found them very reliable.</p><p>BTW, V. Sahasrabuddhe is one slice of a very large iceberg; she happens to<br/>put her stuff up on MP3, but there are many wonderful classical vocalists.<br/>One place to hear a few people:  to out to <a href="http://www.eshakti.com">http://www.eshakti.com</a> and look<br/>down the left column; and see the &quot;Webcast&quot; links.  Once you get there, you<br/>can eventually also find a like to &quot;Basant Bahar Concert&quot; from last year.<br/>There is one recording on-line of V. Sahasrabuddhe&apos;s disciple Jayanti.  Also<br/>a fabulous young singer named Shubhangi Sakhalkar; all in concert with Swapan<br/>Chauduri and Ramesh Misra.</p><p>If you like Carnatic vocal, check out the recordings of Nithyasree Mahadevan<br/>and Sudha Raghunathanavailable under the &quot;2000 Winter Concerts&quot; link.</p><p>Oh, here&apos;s an interesting one:  Kadri Gopalnath playing classical Carnatic<br/>music on the saxophone...</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=555 href="#555">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>7/18/2001 4:51:49 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., Rick McGowan &lt;rick@u...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Nanom3 said...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; the electronic Indian music store.<br/>&gt; &gt; Some of their merchandise looks quite intriguing - I&apos;m<br/>&gt; &gt; gathering up the courage to order online from Bangalore:-)</p><p>No this is the link JStarretr posted, and it is in India.  Fun to<br/>poke around.

I love real Indian music, and as<br/>soon as I am back on a cable system I will be busy downloading.<br/>Actually one of my next projects is to find an Indian vocal teacher<br/>here in the Tucson area (if anyone knows of one).  I think it would<br/>be really helpful to study with someone who is used to alternative<br/>ET&apos;s.</p><p>MAry</p></div>
