In this<br/>group&apos;s files area, in the JdL directory, are the files</p><p>   <a href="http://barricades.zip">barricades.zip</a>: 2 tunings plus explanatory file (also copied below)<br/>   barricades_s.mid: tuning s<br/>   barricades_z.mid: tuning z</p><p>On some systems, the files can be played directly from .mid.  But if you<br/>experience any glitching (which could skew the results), please download<br/>the zip file.</p><p>I&apos;ll put up a poll.</p><p>Thanks for participating!!</p><p>JdL</p><p>[contents of barricades.txt:]<br/>This .zip file contains two tunings of a portion of &quot;Les Barricades<br/>Mysterieuses&quot; by FranÂ‡ois Couperin, sequenced by Jeff Scott.</p><p>   barricades_s.mid<br/>   barricades_z.mid</p><p>The letter suffixes were chosen randomly, and should not be construed<br/>to have any meaning connected to the tuning used.  Nor should the<br/>fact that &apos;s&apos; comes ahead of &apos;z&apos; in the alphabet be construed to mean<br/>anything.</p><p>The two files may be tuned identically, or may be different from each<br/>other.  If they are different, one may be 12-tET, or neither may be<br/>12-tET.</p><p>Ideally, the file you first listen to should be chosen randomly.</p><p>The piece 45 sec long.  It is perfectly permissible to listen only to a<br/>fraction of one, then a fraction of the other.</p><p>There will be a poll in which you may register your tuning preference:</p><p>   . I prefer tuning s.<br/>   . I prefer tuning z.<br/>   . I experienced no significant preference.</p><p>A General-MIDI (GM) compliant sound card or module is required to hear<br/>these files correctly.  If in doubt, listen; if notes are missing,<br/>there&apos;s a problem.</p><p>The MIDI bend range should be set to default: +/- 2 semitones.  The<br/>file gm_reset.mid should ensure this to be the case.</p></div><h3>jpehrson@...</h3><span>8/7/2001 10:17:21 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; &lt;jdl@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/919">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/919</a></p><p>Well...
