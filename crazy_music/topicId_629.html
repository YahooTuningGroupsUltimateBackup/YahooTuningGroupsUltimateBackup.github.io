As the resident Acoustic Moonie on<br/>these lists, i tend to work with few tunings. Making instruments in like<br/>doing sculpture in stone, and each tuning has to hold up to a myriad of<br/>applications or one finds one stuck with no where to go. It isn&apos;t even a<br/>matter of money, but of room, one runs out of space which is a more<br/>difficult thing than it was in Harry&apos;s day.<br/>Regardless as much as this all may appear to be a handicap, I will say<br/>that i know each of my tunings very well before i start to build: that<br/>knowing &quot;one can not turn back&quot; forces the psyche into being more<br/>discriminating. Dealing with more than one mistake, has merely added to<br/>the drama.</p><p>&quot;X. J.
