Currently, I&apos;m playing with scales that have around<br/>20 notes so they can be rounded up to a 24 note keyboard mapping.<br/>They always have enough flexibility that I can find melodies.  I<br/>could design subset scales to contain those melodies, and may do so<br/>to use a synthesizer with a 12-note octave, but haven&apos;t yet.</p><p>I think you said you use a MIDI wind controller.  That must affect<br/>what scales you look at.  What&apos;s the largest convenient number of<br/>notes to an octave?</p><p>The best melodic scale I&apos;ve found must be one at<br/>&lt;<a href="http://x31eq.com/blues.htm">http://x31eq.com/blues.htm</a>&gt;.  Here are some cut and<br/>pasted cents values:</p><p>0 133.6 182.4 386.3 449.3 498.0 653.2<br/>680.4 835.6 884.4 947.3 1151.2 1200</p><p>The 7 note scale was designed to be like some &quot;blues scales&quot; people<br/>were throwing around on The Big List (TBL) but 7-limit rather than 11-<br/>limit.  As I was working it out, I played along on my schismic fourth<br/>mapping.  So I got instant feedback, but that also means it rests on<br/>all the mathematical ideas of schismic temperament.</p><p>There are MIDI files, but I remember them not being very good.</p><p>&gt; What I enjoy are some small scale steps, that I can use as passing<br/>&gt; tones with a primary mode I&apos;m composing with.</p><p>Ah, but you&apos;ve also written in 13-equal, which doesn&apos;t have such<br/>steps!  I think I understand you here, in that a variety of step<br/>sizes makes it easy to find interesting melodies.  But you can always<br/>find good tunes in the small-numbered ETs if you work at it hard<br/>enough.</p><p>Okay, there will be scales with too few notes per octave, or with<br/>those notes all bunched together so they aren&apos;t useful melodically.<br/>But common sense tells you not to worry about them.</p><p>&gt; I have uploaded a new piece to our files section as a demonstration<br/>&gt; of what I mean (Golden Mean). The title is &quot;Two Golden Flutes&quot;, and<br/>&gt; uses the following scale based on the Golden Mean:<br/>&gt;</p><p>&lt;tuning snipped&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; This scale has exactly 3 step sizes:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; 46.427<br/>&gt; 75.120<br/>&gt; 121.546<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; And while the primary mode is and octatonic subset, I use the small<br/>&gt; 46.427 cents intervals frequently as passing tones.</p><p>I always try to tune up a scale before I comment on it, and this<br/>arrived too late last night to do so.</p><p>&gt; Of course, whether I&apos;m making JI, Phi, ETs (frequently stretched<br/>&gt; ones!), the logic for these methods comes into play. Sometimes the<br/>&gt; music requires a certain scale - depending on the timbres, and<br/>&gt; sometimes I&apos;ll create music with the scale qualities directly in<br/>mind<br/>&gt; and choose my timbres accordingly.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hope this example will be a good demo of what I&apos;m getting at - but<br/>&gt; there&apos;s always the chance that it will just cause confusion, since<br/>&gt; I&apos;m not all that great at describing the ineffable things that<br/>happen<br/>&gt; in music when tuning, timbre and rhythm comes together in the mix -<br/>&gt; so I can only speak generally, and give a scale and an example.</p><p>I&apos;m no good at judging a scale by music other people write in it.<br/>This piece sounds good, but I don&apos;t know how it relates to the<br/>numbers you list above.  Even small step-sizes aren&apos;t something I<br/>listen out for.  I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll find them when they&apos;re under my<br/>fingers.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3><a id=533 href="#533">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>7/18/2001 6:35:12 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;Graham Breed&quot; &lt;graham@m...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/crazy_music/topicId_518.html#532">/crazy_music/topicId_518.html#532</a></p><p>I think, in general, Graham makes a good point about melodies...</p><p>i.e. it seems that melodies can be effectively be made from *any*<br/>scale.</p><p>I even managed to make melodies from &quot;hexanies&quot; although, I must<br/>admit, it was a stretch and they were very &quot;angular&quot;<br/>very &quot;Schoenbergian...&quot;</p><p>Perhaps Jacky is subliminally suggesting that the scales with melodic<br/>properties that *he* considers optimal are simply those that fit with<br/>his current or envisioned compositional style.

Sketches are ok here by me.

I recorded them all in one<br/>morning, so there&apos;d be a way for people to get the character of the<br/>scales without having to tune them up.  I thought simple<br/>improvisations would be better than ascending/descending scales for<br/>that.  Last time I heard them they sounded really inept, so I haven&apos;t<br/>dared listen again.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Ah, but you&apos;ve also written in 13-equal, which doesn&apos;t have such<br/>&gt; &gt; steps!

I will explore it more on your recommendation. 7 tET is<br/>&gt; interesting to me - I&apos;ve noodled a bit with this and it&apos;s sweet.</p><p>I don&apos;t know that I&apos;d *recommend* them because they don&apos;t currently<br/>interest me.  But it&apos;s certainly possible to get good music out of<br/>them.  7-equal doesn&apos;t suit me at all, although the pentatonic<br/>subsets are interesting (but the equivalents from a neutral-third MOS<br/>more so).  14-equal is much more promising, and I will get round to<br/>it one day.</p><p>                        Graham</p></div><h3><a id=614 href="#614">ðŸ”—</a>BVAL@...</h3><span>7/20/2001 10:29:51 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jacky,</p><p>I&apos;ve been able to download a few of your mp3s from the CM list.</p><p>Your personality comes through in your music, the yearning for<br/>&apos;freedom&apos;, &apos;joy&apos;, &apos;sharing&apos;, and some humor too.</p><p>You get these really nice sort of &apos;waterfall&apos; melodic lines<br/>happenning, much more gestural than specifically<br/>melodic or harmonic. There is something in there like a hike<br/>I took in Oregon (very green, green, green and watery), or<br/>at Watkins Glen in upstate NY (where the trail actually does<br/>go through a few dozen waterfalls).</p><p>After giving the Golden Flutes a spin, and thinking of the<br/>&quot;stacked cell&quot; thing I&apos;d noticed, I got a better idea of what you<br/>mean by non-octave scales (at least I got a better idea of what<br/>I think it means to me).</p><p>I do something similar in 12 and look forward to exploring the<br/>idea more in microtonal situations. For instance, in 12 I&apos;ll<br/>sometimes use an endless pentatonic</p><p>&#x9;C Eb F Ab Bb Dd Eg Gb etc....</p><p>or endless Lydian</p><p>&#x9;C D E F# G A B C# D E F# G# etc...</p><p>or endless Lydian arpeggio (chord of the #fifteenth)</p><p>&#x9;C E G B D F# A C# E G# etc...</p><p>In a microtonal setting, I anticipated doing this with some<br/>structures that &apos;fold up&apos; too fast in 12, (whole tones, major thirds,<br/>minor thirds as I &apos;grocked&apos; the structure in your scale) as well<br/>as exploring new structures that do (or don&apos;t) fold up in new<br/>ways.</p><p>When I was twiddling with seven equal, one of the prettier<br/>things that came out was just arpeggiating on the &apos;thirds&apos; or<br/>&apos;fourths&apos; of the scale, since it would climc across a number of<br/>octaves in a &apos;strange&apos; manner, while sounding its idea of<br/>&apos;harmoniousnous&apos; the whole time.</p><p>You seem to approach it as if the octave isn&apos;t there whereas<br/>the way I see it (and the way I thought of mapping your scale<br/>to 79) is that the octave just doesn&apos;t happen to be a part of<br/>the musical structure, although it may be part of another<br/>structure that the musical structure is &apos;draped&apos; over (like<br/>the sheet draped over another object, corners and some<br/>surfaces are apparent in the drapery, but the drapery also has<br/>its own shape and folds).</p><p>Thanks Jacky!</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
