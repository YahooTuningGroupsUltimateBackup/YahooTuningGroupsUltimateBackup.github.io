Both curves used 11<br/>partials and intervals in the range of 1/1 to 2/1, with 1/1 equal to<br/>G 392. The curves are scaled so the dissonance peak equals 1.0 for<br/>both, so I could compare relative dissonance. The black curve was<br/>generated with all 11 partials having unit amplitude, and the red<br/>curve was generated using partials scaled by 1/n, that is, the<br/>fundamental has amplitude 1, the first overtone has amplitude 1/2,<br/>etc.</p><p>The red curve (scaled partials) is *overall* less dissonant than the<br/>black curve. And there are really prominent consonances only at 1/1,<br/>3/2 and 2/1 on the red curve. There are two secondary consonances at<br/>4/3 and 5/3, and two more lesser consonances at 5/4 and 7/4, but<br/>that&apos;s about it. There&apos;s no hint of the consonant possibilites of<br/>more complex ratios that can be seen on the black curve.</p><p>I think this red curve represents the way the bulk of non-musical and<br/>semi-musical listeners hear intervals. This makes even more sense<br/>when you take into consideration two other facts. Most conventional<br/>instruments have spectra with amplitudes that decay with frequency,<br/>like the spectrum that generated the red curve, and one&apos;s high-<br/>frequency sensitivity decays with age.</p><p>The black curve more closely represents the consonances in the One-<br/>Footed Bride, which clearly *Partch* was able to hear. I suspect most<br/>musically-trained people, at least the younger ones, would most<br/>likely be able to hear these as well. The other conclusions I draw<br/>from these curves:</p><p>1. I should use musical sources rich in harmonics to get the most out<br/>of Monophony. That isn&apos;t a problem with electronic instruments,<br/>although I do need to stay under the Nyquist limit to avoid aliasing.<br/>The &quot;buzz&quot; unit in CSound or SAOL can do this. Curiously enough, it<br/>is the buzz unit that is the driver for many simulations of the human<br/>voice.</p><p>2. The Chromelodeon and reed organs (harmoniums) in general may have<br/>more harmonically rich spectra than other instruments, since Partch<br/>was able to hear his intervals very clearly on the Chromelodeon.</p><p>3. Microtonal music using conventional instruments, even if they are<br/>modified to use just ratios, is likely to sound &quot;pleasant but weird&quot;<br/>to typical audiences. Indeed, that was my reaction to Bill Sethares&apos;<br/>compositions on _Xentonality_, Easley Blackwood&apos;s microtonal etudes<br/>and Wendy Carlos&apos; alternative scales: pleasant but weird. So I&apos;m<br/>beginning to think that there is a *natural* limit to the potential<br/>audience for microtonality in addition to the more obvious economic<br/>ones.</p><p>That doesn&apos;t deter me from continuing down this path, since I&apos;m not<br/>in this for the money, and I doubt very seriously if a century from<br/>now, my name will be ranked up there with Partch, Xenakis, Lou<br/>Harrison or any other well-known avant garde composers. But I think<br/>it is another reason why today&apos;s composers, young and old alike,<br/>compose mostly in 12-TET for conventional instruments and ensembles --<br/> the audiences can&apos;t hear the difference.<br/>--<br/>M.

Maybe with the addendum that if they<br/>can, it apparantly doesn&apos;t matter much. Many people, even on this<br/>list, have said that all the intonational accuracy and tweaking of<br/>microtonal scalar and harmonic materials matter not if the content<br/>that they are in service of is lacking.</p><p>As for Partch, I know *for a fact* that a large part of the audience,<br/>when I used to perform his music, couldn&apos;t give a shit about &quot;43<br/>tones to the octave&quot; or anything else; it was the music written in<br/>that system, the instrumental resources, and all the extra-musical<br/>elements that made for an affecting experience.</p><p>And as for *you*, I am emminantly fascinated by your approach to<br/>this, coming as it does from such a different angle, and I very much<br/>look forward to some of the interim, as well as final, results.</p><p>Damn, I sure am glad someone invented the comma (punctuation, not<br/>shoe)...</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Jon</p></div><h3><a id=171 href="#171">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>6/17/2001 6:10:57 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;Ed Borasky&quot; &lt;znmeb@a...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="/crazy_music/topicId_168.html#168">/crazy_music/topicId_168.html#168</a></p><p>&gt; 3.
