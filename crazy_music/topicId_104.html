(Robert Walker and I did some<br/>&gt; work together on these types of uniquely or maximally compact subsets<br/>&gt; as well, and I think Robert had a post and music examples that are<br/>&gt; still in the tank relating to these. Hi Robert...)</p><p>Yes, I&apos;ve still got the draft of it which I accidentally posted to TL<br/>before it was ready, and also somewhere, some additions / corrections to<br/>it.</p><p>Maybe I can post it here and c.c. to main list?<br/>It has a fractal tune ex, so it is practical.</p><p>I&apos;ll need to get back into the way of thinking about it.</p><p>Happened just before the flood of 72-tet posts to TL, at which point I<br/>pretty much stopped posting there regularly, as I couldn&apos;t keep up with<br/>all the digests, and mightn&apos;t have found any replies for a while.</p><p>I still haven&apos;t looked through all the titles of all the digests, just<br/>look at a few now and again - get as many digests from the various<br/>microtonal groups I belong to as I get individual e-mails! In fact,<br/>looking at my inbox recently, I think the digests outnumber the individual<br/>e-mails. Some days I look through most of the topics lists, and sometimes<br/>I don&apos;t get round to doing that at all.</p><p>I suppose we just have to accept that the microtonal scene has grown<br/>to the extent one can no longer easily keep in touch with everything that<br/>is happening in TL and its off-shoots.</p><p>I&apos;ve added a tune in your diatonic scale to my tunes page. I wrote it<br/>this evening.</p><p>A kind of sad / optimistic lento.</p><p><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tunes/tunes.htm">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tunes/tunes.htm</a></p><p>Do you have any pieces you&apos;ve done in this diatonic scale? I&apos;d like to<br/>hear them!</p><p>I&apos;ve also improvised in it and enjoyed doing so. :-)</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=107 href="#107">ðŸ”—</a>JSZANTO@...</h3><span>6/5/2001 8:07:23 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dan,</p><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., &quot;D.Stearns&quot; &lt;STEARNS@C...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; The handful of mp3s of mine that are around were done by John<br/>&gt; Starrett.
