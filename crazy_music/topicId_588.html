You can see a lighthouse to the north painted<br/>in an exotic pattern. It is overcast and a bit chilly<br/>as a storm gathers at sea. It progresses and you watch<br/>it, entranced. Lightning scampers across the horizon.<br/>The air ionizes and smells sweet. From time to time you<br/>wonder about getting back but you know you belong here<br/>at this moment. Puffs of wind tease you as rain flirts<br/>down occasionally, withdrawing whenever you start to<br/>retreat.</p><p>Piano tuned according to method of Reperio.</p><p>Apologies for the low fidelity 96kbps mp3 encoding;<br/>this web account has file size limitations.</p><p>Storm.mp3 (4&apos;05.0&quot;, 2,937,799 bytes)<br/>(c) 19 July 2001 by X.

Improv?</p><p>Do you have a list of the tuning of the notes in cents from 1/1, e.g.:<br/>&#x9;100,100,100,100,100...<br/>would be 12-tET.  I saw reperio.html but that doesn&apos;t do it for me...  Or<br/>are the successive notes actually 120,218,207,183 etc?</p><p>Question... Is that a real piano physically tuned; or an electronic<br/>instrument?  The outdoorsy sound effects are added, or was it a physical<br/>instrument &amp; mic?</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div><h3><a id=609 href="#609">ðŸ”—</a>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2001 4:35:53 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff wrote:</p><p>&gt; Storm.mp3 (4&apos;05.0&quot;, 2,937,799 bytes)<br/>&gt; (c) 19 July 2001 by X.

This isn&apos;t as good as Sweet Kuvasz, but not much<br/>is, so even hate mail about how your music isn&apos;t improving wouldn&apos;t<br/>seethe in a particularly enjoyable way.</p><p>Oh, yes, holy.mp3 is a sawtooth wave.  I could give them up any time<br/>I want, honest.  Any ideas about the timbre for the broken talisman?</p><p>                       Graham</p></div>
