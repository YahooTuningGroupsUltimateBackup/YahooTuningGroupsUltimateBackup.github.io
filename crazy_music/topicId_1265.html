Yes. Silence here could hint that everyone&apos;s off working xenharmonic wonders, or<br/>it could imply that people weren&apos;t going to do anything but talk anyway and now have<br/>resumed their dreary lives.  From the looks of it these are equally probable.</p><p>Regarding instrument design. I had a Bart Hopkin book, lost it.  Very sad. Was kind of<br/>hoping the internet was a good place to exchange ideas and get help building<br/>instruments.  Obviously not the point of this list, but maybe out there somewhere.<br/>And do you know where I could find ethnic instruments at obscenely low prices?<br/>(Lower than Lark in the Morning?)</p><p>Regarding more &quot;unimportant&quot; stuff like notation. I am straddling your world and that<br/>of the classical institutions.  I hope to lure them in this direction, and to do so must<br/>speak their language, which also happens to be mine. Or something like that. I&apos;ll<br/>report back in a month regarding my success getting college string players (and<br/>musical sawists) to hit 11-limit intervals.  And you can judge from hearing.</p><p>Questions for Brian McLaren (and whomever else):</p><p>1) Is it more important for microtonal music to get the greatest exposure possible, or<br/>for microtonal music makers to make as much money as possible? The middle<br/>ground, of course, is having a website that gives away some but not all.  Enough for<br/>those looking just to get some microtonality in their ear ASAP (which is a good thing,<br/>right?); enough to convince someone that a CD is worth buying.  But not enough to<br/>cheapen the CD or whatever.  Like XJ&apos;s or Sethares&apos;.</p><p>2) Is the Internet any good at all?  How does the Internet compare with libraries for<br/>microtonal education?  From my experience: my library has sufficent introductory<br/>texts to get someone thinking (Partch, Moreno, etc.), and as far as CDs go: 1<br/>Wyschnegradsky, 1 Ezra Sims, a few compilation CDs with quartertone pianos and<br/>harpsichords, a few Kronos CDs with some Partch and Johnston...that&apos;s it.  Online, I<br/>find enough theory to kill a man, FREE retuning software so I can hear things for<br/>myself, an applet that bends timbres to scales, applets allowing me to play a tonality<br/>diamond, a bosquanet lattice, etc., and 11+ hours of free music in various ET, JI, and<br/>non-octave scales. On top of that the Internet is open 24 hours daily and does not<br/>charge me $20 when I am one day late returning CDs.</p><p>3) Is it a contradiction both to talk and do?  You have talked plenty; yet you claim you<br/>do. Obviously there is some overlap.  For me, talk is play, music making is work.  I<br/>confess I have been neglecting work too much of late; therefore I retire from talking<br/>until I have produced something I am happy with.  Goodbye.</p></div><h3>Pete McRae &#x3C;peteysan@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2004 11:12:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p><a href="http://www.shakuhachi.com">www.shakuhachi.com</a>   Monty makes amazing instruments, and seems to have all the Bart Hopkin books in stock, if you want a replacement.</p><p>&gt;Was kind of<br/>&gt;hoping the internet was a good place to exchange ideas and get help &gt;building instruments.</p><p>Partch took an adult education woodworking class to build his first Kithara, as you probably know.

I built myself a replica of a harmonic canon<br/>correcting Partch&apos;s grossly incompetent design and it works and sounds<br/>great. You can great a whole lot of microtonal music even with such<br/>simple and easy-to-build acoustic instruments.<br/>Bill Wesley in San Diego may be the current king of home-made<br/>xenharmonc instruments, though Tom Nunn in San Frqancisco is no slouch<br/>either.<br/>Richard Waters continues to produce impressive metal-sculpture<br/>instruments, as do the Baschet brothers in France.<br/>As mentioned, virtually none of these people have any presence online.<br/>They all inhabit meatspace, not cyberspace.</p></div><h3>X. J. Scott &#x3C;xjscott@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/27/2004 3:22:44 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Pete,</p><p>&gt; I say, To hell with recorded music, go visit these people if you can, play<br/>&gt; with them, have coffee, tacos, and more endless actual paper sheets of scales<br/>&gt; and formulae--BUT...you got them from out of someone&apos;s very own file cabinets,<br/>&gt; so they&apos;re permeated with the air of that person&apos;s home, and they personally<br/>&gt; explained to you what and why and coughed in your ear.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I won&apos;t ever forget the afternoon I spent at Ivor&apos;s house, and it&apos;s not<br/>&gt; cluttering my &apos;hard-drive&apos; in the least...</p><p>Wonderful advice. Real, live interaction with others is the best way to<br/>quickly learn and establish lifelong and productive relationships.</p><p>On the CD issue, I&apos;d recommend Beauty in the Beast since it&apos;s a seminal work<br/>and a good one that most everyone has. I think it is back in production too<br/>- it was out of print for a while. After that, I&apos;d probably just want to<br/>have a few CDs of music from various cultures as a minimum.</p><p>For most of us there were no albums of microtonal music practically<br/>available so we learned on our own and that was maybe even a help instead of<br/>a hindrance.</p><p>I don&apos;t know if everyone is familiar with Jacob Barton&apos;s work, but I&apos;ve had<br/>the privledge of hearing some of his xenharmonic compositions and I find<br/>them superlative. I can&apos;t think of anyone that could really teach him a<br/>great deal about microtonal composition; he&apos;s doing great already especially<br/>considering his young age. This is still a pioneering field where each may<br/>find his own way, so that&apos;s ok. His lifelong passion for wind instruments is<br/>something that would be a shame to abandon or neglect, but rather integrate.<br/>I do hope to hear more of his work since what he has done so far is<br/>intricately crafted and enjoyable.</p><p>It&apos;s an interesting perspective that composition is work and talk is play.<br/>This seems a pretty healthy view and has the built in temperance of life<br/>balance. Creation and communication/relationships are both important.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
