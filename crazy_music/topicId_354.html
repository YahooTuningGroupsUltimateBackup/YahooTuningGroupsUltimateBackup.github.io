And, I don&apos;t really _care_ if you believe things that I think<br/>are silly: it doesn&apos;t prevent me from doing the work I value in music.<br/>My place is musical history does not depend upon your approval, nor does<br/>yours depend upon mine.</p><p>I have pledged not to bandy about nasty words on this list, and I intend<br/>to keep that pledge.  Would you please do the same?  If you want to<br/>butt heads, let&apos;s do it on tuning-challenges (where, indeed, a post from<br/>me already awaits you, if you&apos;re interested).</p><p>Thanks, and good luck with your music!</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=839 href="#839">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2001 5:04:33 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[mclaren wrote:]<br/>&gt;Of course John deLaubenfels&apos; program of retuning 12-equal<br/>&gt;compositions to 5-limit JI by redistributing the warped<br/>&gt;out of tune melodic pitches in various elaborate ways had<br/>&gt;been tried in the 19th century.<br/>&gt;   The entire program had been tried, and it failed:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   &quot;Today the elaborate and ingenious attempts of Perronet<br/>&gt;Thompson, Bosanquet and others to devise new keyboards, with<br/>&gt;many more pipes to the octave, are historical curiosities, mere<br/>&gt;museum specimens. And one reason why they failed was that theorists<br/>&gt;left the properties of the human ear out of account.&quot; [Lloyd, L.S.,<br/>&gt;&quot;Just Intonation Misconceived,&quot; Music and Letters, Vol. 23, No. 1,<br/>&gt;1943, pg. 133]</p><p>Mclaren, do you have _any_ idea what I do???  Have you ever listened<br/>to just _one_ of my tunings?  The tango, for example, which is in<br/>this group&apos;s file section, under the JdL directory.</p><p>I don&apos;t think that what I do has been tried before, for the reason that<br/>computers to do the tradeoff calculations didn&apos;t exist for a long time,<br/>and when they became affordable, it took a few years for someone to<br/>bumble along and do it.</p><p>It has nothing to do with keyboards.  Each pitch class has a<br/>continuously modifiable tuning (within the limits of resolution in MIDI<br/>and the playback module), which the program calculates on the fly.</p><p>As to your assertion that I am beginning to &quot;wiggle and squirm&quot; because<br/>I&apos;m asking for actual MIDI sequences (of which there are thousands,<br/>available for free, across a wide spectrum of genres, on <a href="http://prs.net">prs.net</a> and<br/>other locations), all I can think is that you are afraid for a test to<br/>take place.  It is absolutely not necessary to demand that _new_<br/>sequences be created just to satisfy a reasonable pick of pieces.</p><p>I gave you a chance to pick the pieces; now I&apos;m giving that choice to<br/>others.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
