The working title is &quot;When<br/>Harry Met Iannis&quot;. I&apos;m using Xenakis&apos; stochastic composition techniques,<br/>limited to pitches from the &quot;Partch System&quot; -- 11-limit JI with 1/1 = G392,<br/>the 43-degree scale, Otonalities and Utonalities, intervals of power,<br/>emotion, suspense and approach, etc. What I&apos;m trying to do is define all<br/>these concepts from _Genesis of a Music_ as functions / subroutines /<br/>tables, then have the algorithmic composition work at a high level in the<br/>space thus defined.</p><p>I looked again at the Prent Rogers website. He is using the Partch scale and<br/>sample-based CSound instruments. I think some of his music is created using<br/>algorithmic composition, but that wasn&apos;t clear from the web page. I&apos;m using<br/>physical models in SAOL rather than sample-based CSound instruments, and the<br/>&quot;score&quot; will be generated live in SAOL rather than with a macro preprocessor<br/>like Prent Rogers.</p><p>I had originally planned to do the offline planning work -- table<br/>generation, etc. -- in Perl, but since Derive can output C code and SAOL is<br/>very much like C, it&apos;s just as easy or easier for me to do it in Derive. The<br/>only tricky part is going to be that the Xenakis&apos; methods are heavily<br/>matrix-oriented and SAOL only allows one-dimensional arrays.

What is interesting is that the One-Footed Bride includes all of<br/>these as consonances, but it *also* includes their *complements*: 12/7, 8/5,<br/>10/7 and 8/7 in addition to the ones listed. These last four *don&apos;t* show as<br/>consonances on the Sethares curve. And there&apos;s nary a 9 or 11 to be found<br/>amongst the Sethares consonances.

Thus, his curve has an otonal bias.<br/>Partch&apos;s does not - it is strictly a dyadic interval measure, which<br/>exhibits the dualistic (otonal/utonal) properties that are fundamental<br/>to Partch&apos;s theories.</p><p>IMO, the harmonic entropy curve is much closer to what you&apos;re trying<br/>to do.  Sethares&apos;s curves are implemented with larger collections<br/>of pitches in mind (triads, tetrads, pentads, hexads, etc.).</p><p>BTW, as you should be aware, I&apos;m interested in implementing a<br/>number of Partch&apos;s theoretical procedures in JustMusic.

I renamed the files and added<br/>gridlines to the 11-partial plot. 10/9, 9/8 and 8/7 now take their rightful<br/>place between 1/1 and 7/6, 7/5 and 10/7 are both represented now with<br/>roughly equal dissonance scores, 11/9 is there, looking slightly less<br/>dissonant than its neighbor 6/5, and quite a few more of the 43 degrees of<br/>the Partch scale are now located at consonances.</p><p>As to the differences between these curves and the harmonic entropy curves,<br/>my conjecture is that for purely harmonic spectra, aside from the fact that<br/>the consonances in the HE curves are round rather than pointed, for most<br/>practical purposes the curves will be the same if one tweaks the parameters<br/>correctly. I personally prefer the pointed consonances to the rounded ones.</p><p>Incidentally, when I used partials with amplitudes equal to 1/n rather than<br/>1, the curves were nowhere near as dramatic. Since the Sethares theory is<br/>supposedly based on psychoacoustics, I question whether the &quot;average<br/>untrained ear&quot; perceives consonance and dissonance the way the harmonic<br/>entropy curve and the unit-amplitude Sethares curve show, or more the way<br/>the 1/n scaled amplitude curve shows.</p><p>Clearly we musical folk can hear these things, but can our more naive<br/>listeners? The relative smoothness of the curve for harmonic sounds with<br/>descending-amplitude partials might explain why the masses have little<br/>trouble enjoying 12-TET music on conventional instruments, despite the<br/>theory that says the equal tempered major third, for example, is &quot;woefully<br/>out of tune&quot;. I&apos;m going to plot the two curves on the same graph and upload<br/>the picture a little later.</p><p>One other note: I haven&apos;t said much about Xenakis in this discussion, and<br/>his theories and techniques share equal footing with those of Partch in this<br/>work. In passing, though, I would like to note that there is a section in<br/>_Formalized Music_ about the evolution of music from the Ancient Greek<br/>tetrachords that I think is highly relevant. I doubt if there is anything in<br/>it that the folks here haven&apos;t already seen, but it was one of the things<br/>that triggered my interest in combining Xenakis and Partch.<br/>--<br/>M.

Thus, his curve has an otonal bias.<br/>&gt; Partch&apos;s does not - it is strictly a dyadic interval measure, which<br/>&gt; exhibits the dualistic (otonal/utonal) properties that are fundamental<br/>&gt; to Partch&apos;s theories.</p><p>Well, as the title of Sethares&apos; book is _Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale_, I<br/>think his goals are somewhat broader than that, and indeed, broader than<br/>mine at the moment. My goal is to produce a piece and the tools to create<br/>the piece. I don&apos;t see the &quot;otonal bias&quot; in the Sethares curves. The bias I<br/>*do* see there is that the Sethares equations depend, as does the underlying<br/>theory, on the absolute frequencies at which the notes are played. The<br/>harmonic entropy curves, IIRC, are purely based on ratios. My curves were<br/>generated with 1/1 equal to Partch&apos;s G 392. Since my piece will use the<br/>Partch scale, I intend to use purely harmonic timbres to maximize the<br/>consonances, and it will probably be centered at G392. And I certainly<br/>intend to use both Otonalities and Utonalities.</p><p>&gt; IMO, the harmonic entropy curve is much closer to what you&apos;re trying<br/>&gt; to do.  Sethares&apos;s curves are implemented with larger collections<br/>&gt; of pitches in mind (triads, tetrads, pentads, hexads, etc.).</p><p>My intention is to use all of these (although there is only one hexad in<br/>each tonality).</p><p>&gt; BTW, as you should be aware, I&apos;m interested in implementing a<br/>&gt; number of Partch&apos;s theoretical procedures in JustMusic.  I just<br/>&gt; posted something to that group last week about creating a window<br/>&gt; to display his &quot;Field of Attraction&quot;:<br/>&gt; <a href="/justmusic/topicId_unknown.html#144">/justmusic/topicId_unknown.html#144</a></p><p>Once I get my code working and my piece in construction, I&apos;ll contribute it<br/>to JustMusic. It will most likely be in C, since &quot;sfront&quot; is written in C<br/>and creates output files in C and Derive can write C code. The Field Of<br/>Attraction is one element I will be using.</p></div><h3><a id=165 href="#165">ðŸ”—</a>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/17/2000 1:22:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>&gt; From: M.
