By 14th-century conventions, this beautiful<br/>cadence might tend to be less conclusive than one with ascending<br/>semitones, like the first example of my earlier post:</p><p> C#5  D5<br/> G#4  A4<br/> E4   D4</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/17tet001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/17tet001.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Any of these cadences brings us to the stable goal of a complete 2:3:4<br/>sonority (or actually the tempered approximation) on D4-A4-D5, and I<br/>would say that the augmented sixth variety can lend an air of mystery<br/>or &quot;Impressionism.&quot; A neat feature of this variety is that it has both<br/>ascending and descending semitone motions at the same time.</p><p>Mary, your generosity moves me to add something that should go without<br/>saying, but feels good to say anyway. While I happen to approach these<br/>progressions from a neo-Gothic viewpoint, they are part of the general<br/>resources of 17-tET, there for the taking and sharing. If the shoe<br/>fits the musical moment, why not wear it?</p><p>Most appreciatively, with love and peace to all,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
