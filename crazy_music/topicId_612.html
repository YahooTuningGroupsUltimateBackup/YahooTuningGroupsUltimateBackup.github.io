Smell the latte. On the internet no<br/>&gt; one is ever convinced of anything, they&apos;re all<br/>&gt; kooks and cranks and flakes looking for converts<br/>&gt; for their musical cult religions. Very few<br/>&gt; people on the internet care about discussing<br/>&gt; *anything* -- for most of these kooks and cranks<br/>&gt; and flakes, it&apos;s nothing but an eternal on-line<br/>&gt; jihad on behalf of their cult guru (Schoenberg,<br/>&gt; Partch, Pythagoras, Rameau, whoever).</p><p>There is a lot of kookery, but the internet as it was originally, a<br/>medium for researchers to share data and information, still exists.<br/>Witness such groups as sci.math.research, sci.physics.research,<br/>the <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov">xxx.lanl.gov</a> preprint archives, numerous expository pages on<br/>string theory general relativity, etc. There is a lot of really top<br/>notch scholarship out there, although the signal to noise ratio is<br/>very low. Actually, this group is a little like the xxx preprint<br/>archives. Preliminary work is submitted for review and comment, ideas<br/>are discussed, and sometimes, yes, people are convinced.</p><p>&gt;     And THIS is the brain of the planet?<br/>&gt;     No, the internet isn&apos;t the brain of the planet...<br/>&gt; it&apos;s another part of the planet, at the opposite<br/>&gt; end of the body.</p><p>It depends on where you look. Besides looking for new and interesting<br/>music, I mostly use the internet for research, and for me, there are<br/>great resources. You just have to be discriminating. Unfortunately, if<br/>you don&apos;t already know something about a subject, it is easy to be<br/>decieved.</p><p>&gt; ---------<br/>&gt; --mclaren</p><p>John Starrett</p></div>
