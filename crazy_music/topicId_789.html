Hope it will be of further help to<br/>&gt; you in your research.</p><p>Jacky, I converted that spectrogram back to audio data<br/>and it is saying &quot;You ate the devil.&quot; or some such...<br/>it was so heavily processed, I could hardly tell.<br/>Thus, I have to conclude you made it as some sort of<br/>prank. Besides, nudibranches don&apos;t have shells, dude!!</p><p>I rather appreciated your first post which containing<br/>useful data on mollusks but I really mollusk object to<br/>this silly prank of yours!</p><p>&gt; May I inquire as to what this &quot;model&quot; you refer to is about<br/>&gt; with regard to Mollusks? This is an extremely interesting<br/>&gt; topic to me! Curious to know what you are up to.</p><p>You will be fascinated by what I have come up with. I<br/>know it sounds incredible, but Nudibranches are the KEY<br/>to understanding how we percieve music and the data<br/>from the simulations will put to bed a number of absurd<br/>lies about music peception that have been propagated<br/>through some of these tuning forums.</p><p>More to come -- I will prepare a synopsis of my<br/>research and post it later.</p><p>&gt; Thanks, and glad to be of help,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Jacky Ligon</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
