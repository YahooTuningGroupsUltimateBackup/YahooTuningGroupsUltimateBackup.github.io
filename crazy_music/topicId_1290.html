I like 5 tet because the<br/>fingering is really easy (just 1,3 1,3 all the way up), it sounds good and there are some<br/>nice sounding chords as well. We&apos;re going to make the amps too, and some electric<br/>percussion with piezo transducers.<br/><a href="http://www.runoffgroove.com/ruby.html">http://www.runoffgroove.com/ruby.html</a>   <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ubertar/amp">www.geocities.com/ubertar/amp</a></p><p>I&apos;m really psyched to hear what these kids will come up with. I&apos;m hoping to have them<br/>record a cd by the end of the school year.</p><p>I made a series of electric guitars recently that are each tuned to a different equal tuning.<br/>I&apos;m planning on recording a cd featuring them but have to finish another cd first as well as<br/>other projects, but hopefully I&apos;ll get to that soon.</p></div><h3><a id=1292 href="#1292">ðŸ”—</a>X.

I suppose the</p><p>yeah that happened to me i kinda listen to a lot of heavy deathy<br/>metal and no one seems to hear what the musicans are trying to<br/>express i guess most people here would avoid that kinda music like<br/>the plague reagardless.  but personally there are so many diffrent<br/>forms of metal that it seems to be the only style of music with any<br/>createive freedom left. and that what i don&apos;t like with music<br/>schools ect they tend to destory the ability to create music and<br/>replace it with the ablity to mimic something thats been done a<br/>million times before..  cost me a good drummer but hey ill find<br/>another sooner or later</p><p>&gt; counterargument would be that exposing students to all the<br/>possibilities at the beginning<br/>&gt; would lead to chaos, but what&apos;s so bad about a little chaos every<br/>now and then?
