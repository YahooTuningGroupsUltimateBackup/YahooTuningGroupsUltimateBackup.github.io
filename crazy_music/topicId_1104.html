I&apos;ve no reason to believe I&apos;m being moderated, and<br/>it seems to have more or less cleared up now. Only seemed to affect<br/>me, and wasn&apos;t at this end as my other e-mails to the states<br/>were going through okay. Also other Europe e-mails to tuning<br/>were going through okay as one could check by the sent date.</p><p>So seems most likely, a temporary glitch at Yahoo that only affected<br/>me for some reason. Perhaps this just happens from time to time.</p><p>Not much chance of finding out the details, as they are very<br/>slow indeed to respond to help enquiries - not surprising for<br/>a free service so widely used.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
