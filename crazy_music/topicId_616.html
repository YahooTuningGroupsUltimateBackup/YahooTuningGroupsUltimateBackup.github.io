I<br/>am especially sick of the posts from McLaren, who seems simply incapable of<br/>civil behavior and won&apos;t stay on-topic.</p><p>If anyone makes a new group that follows something like Margo&apos;s proposed<br/>charter as posted on the Tuning-Challenges list, and it&apos;s moderated, I&apos;ll<br/>join.  Maybe one of you will drop me a line if that ever happens.</p><p>Until then, I am unsubscribing from this list.</p><p>Ciao,</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
