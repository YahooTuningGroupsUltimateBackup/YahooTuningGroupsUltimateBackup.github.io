It&apos;s the *change* in the reflected<br/>sound that they respond to.  They create the sound mass<br/>so that there is a certain level of background noise<br/>and if it changes, then they know that something has<br/>come near.</p><p>Be careful calling it &quot;Monz&apos;s theory&quot;... as I said,<br/>I got it from someone else, and have never read about<br/>it anywhere.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
