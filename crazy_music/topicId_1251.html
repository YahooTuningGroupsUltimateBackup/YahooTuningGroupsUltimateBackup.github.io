An<br/>understanding of the use of white space and also negative foregrounds is<br/>just as important in painting as it is in music.</p><p>There are times to be silent, there are times to make music, and there are<br/>times to not make music but not be silent either.</p><p>-------</p><p>Some thoughts to ponder:</p><p>&quot;In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence<br/>of our friends.&quot; -- Martin Luther King, Jr.</p><p>&quot;Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.&quot;<br/>-- Martin Luther King, Jr.</p><p>&quot;In Germany they came first for the Communists, and I didn&apos;t speak up<br/>because I wasn&apos;t a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I didn&apos;t<br/>speak up because I wasn&apos;t a Jew. Then they came for the trade unionists, and<br/>I didn&apos;t speak up because I wasn&apos;t a trade unionist. Then they came for the<br/>Catholics, and I didn&apos;t speak up because I was a Protestant. Then they came<br/>for me, and by that time no one was left to speak up.&quot; -- Martin Niemoller</p><p>&quot;Lying is done with words and also with silence.&quot; -- Adrienne Rich</p><p>&quot;No person is your friend who demands your silence, or denies your right to<br/>grow.&quot; -- Alice Walker</p><p>&quot;Silence is the virtue of fools.&quot; -- Sir Francis Bacon</p></div>
