A superstition is a belief, usually expressed in<br/>definitive terms, for which there is no verifiable, factual<br/>basis.&quot; -- [Postman, Neil,  &quot;Conscientious Objections,&quot;<br/>Vitnage Books, New York: 1988, pp. 94-95]</p><p>For ten long years the Alternative Wanking List has acted as<br/>a superstition machine. It has churned out a seemingly<br/>endless series of beliefs, expressed in definitive terms,<br/>for which  no one has shown any verifiable factual basis.</p><p>The most fundamental superstition peddled by the Alternative<br/>Wanking List is the belief that math has some connection<br/>with music.</p><p>What evidence would suffice to falsify that hypothesis?</p><p>Elementary logic informs us that there exist only two<br/>possibilities. Either (A) Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot;<br/>Smith does not believe that math has a connection with<br/>music, or (B) Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith does<br/>believe that math has a connection.</p><p>If he does not believe that math has any connection with<br/>music, then what is the point of all the math Gene &quot;Woolly-<br/>Headed Numerology&quot; Smith&apos;s mathematical posts about music?</p><p>Logically, if Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith doesn&apos;t<br/>believe math has a connection with music, then all his<br/>mathematical posts on the ATL are pointless and off-topic,<br/>and further mathematical posts by Gene Smith should be<br/>deleted as meaningless and unrelated to the stated purpose of<br/>the disucssion group.</p><p>On the other hand, if Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith<br/>does believe that math has a connection with music, then<br/>there must be some hard evidence to falsify that hypothesis<br/>-- so what is it? Where is it?</p><p>Tell us what evidence you would require to disprove the<br/>belief that math has a connection with music,  Gene &quot;Woolly-<br/>Headed Numerology&quot; Smith.</p><p>Is your hypothesis falsifiable?</p><p>Prove it.  Show us how to falsify the hypothesis.</p><p>-------------------------<br/>While Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith is fumbling and<br/>stumbling and bumbling and bungling around in a desperately<br/>failed attempt to provide us with a credible answer to that<br/>question, let&apos;s zero in on a  recent post by Smith.</p><p>In   message 53061 of  the Alternative Lying List, Gene<br/>&quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith claims:</p><p>Message 53079  |   Previous |  Next  [ Up Thread ] &#x9;<br/>Message Index &#x9;<br/>  Msg #<br/>From:  &quot;Gene Ward Smith&quot; &lt;gwsmith@s...&gt;<br/>Date:  Tue Apr 6, 2004  8:46 am<br/>Subject:  Six more {2,3,7} Fokker blocks</p><p>&quot;These are, up to transposition, all the Fokker blocks with<br/>64/63 and 6561/6272 as commas.&quot;</p><p>[1 28/27 9/8 7/6 81/64 21/16 112/81 3/2 14/9 27/16 7/4<br/>49/27]<br/>[1 28/27 9/8 7/6 9/7 4/3 81/56 3/2 14/9 27/16 16/9 27/14]<br/>[1 28/27 9/8 7/6 81/64 21/16 112/81 3/2 14/9 27/16 7/4<br/>243/128]<br/>[1 28/27 9/8 7/6 81/64 4/3 112/81 3/2 14/9 27/16 7/4 27/14]<br/>[1 54/49 8/7 32/27 9/7 4/3 81/56 32/21 81/49 12/7 16/9<br/>27/14]<br/>[1 28/27 9/8 32/27 9/7 4/3 81/56 3/2 14/9 12/7 16/9 27/14]<br/>------------------</p><p>A. D. Fokker&apos;s periodicity blocks boil down to points and<br/>distances in ratio space. It&apos;s simple and easy to prove this<br/>by looking at Fokker&apos;s original paper on the subject.</p><p>Since Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith has subjected us<br/>to a deluge of numbers lasting many years, we would like to<br/>have some proof that we are not being subjected to a display<br/>of vacuous numerology.</p><p>Where is the hard evidence that shows that the points and<br/>distances of Fokker periodicity blocks are actually audible<br/>in real music in the real world?</p><p>Where are the listening tests published in peer-reviewed<br/>scientific journals which prove that listeners can hear<br/>points and distances in ratio space (which is what Fokker<br/>periodicity blocks boil down to)?</p><p>Show us the proof, Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith.</p><p>Where is it?</p><p>Let us see the hard evidence, of the kind we would demand in<br/>a murder trial, or a scientific experiment.  Show it to us.<br/>----------------------<br/>And while Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith is<br/>frantically thrashing and flailing in a doomed attempt to<br/>give us a credible answer to that question, let us focus on<br/>one last simple question.</p><p>In the website <a href="http://www.xenharmony.org">www.xenharmony.org</a> the first words we<br/>encounter under the topic &quot;theory&quot; are:</p><p>&quot;For p an odd prime, the intervals of the p-limit Np may be<br/>taken as the set of  all frequency ratios which are positive<br/>rational numbers whose factorization  involves only primes<br/>less than or equal to p. If q is such a ratio, it may be<br/>written in factored form as</p><p>q = 2^e2 3^e3 ... p^ep</p><p>where e2, e3, ... ep are integer exponents. We may write<br/>this in factored form as a row vector of the exponents, or<br/>monzo:</p><p>[e2, e3, ..., ep]&quot;</p><p>What is the hard eivdence showing that these row vectors of<br/>exponents are audible? Can we hear this stuff?  Or is it all<br/>just numerological bullshit with no connection to observable<br/>reality, like the calculations of astrology?</p><p>Let us see the proof that these row vectors of exponents are<br/>audible.<br/>Show it to us. Where is it?<br/>=======================<br/>Bear in mind that this current post, filled with critical<br/>skeptical thinking and embodying the fundamental basis of<br/>rational inquiry which underlies modern Western<br/>civilization, is brought to you in defiance of a blanket ban<br/>of all my posts by the so-called &quot;moderators&quot; of the<br/>Alternative Lying List.<br/>Note well what is going on here, ladies and gentlemen.<br/>The skeptical critical thinking which I constantly bring to<br/>bear is the foundation of modern Western society.  The<br/>constant demand for hard evidence (&quot;Where is the proof?<br/>Show it to us. Where is it?&quot;)  is what separates the modern<br/>Western world from the medieval realm of mindless superstition.<br/>Skeptical critical thinking is what separates science from astrology<br/>or psychic surgery.<br/>Yet it is precisely this skeptical critical thinking which<br/>has been systematically censored from the Alternative Wanking List.<br/>It is precisely because I so relentlessly demand hard<br/>evidence that my posts have been permanently banned from the<br/>ATL.<br/>What does a reasonable person conclude from these facts?<br/>---------<br/>--mclaren</p></div>
