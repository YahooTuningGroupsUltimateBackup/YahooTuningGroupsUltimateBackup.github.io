Haven&apos;t seen any in Oxford, but UK<br/>is a large place,...</p><p>Actually I based it on memories of a hurdy gurdy player I heard in the street on a visit to Paris a<br/>good few years ago.</p><p>Yes, I plan to keep adding to the page. In fact, just added something to it now, a movement somewhat<br/>in style of C.P.E. Bach and J.C. Bach, with a bit of a surprise ending. It&apos;s in quarter comma<br/>meantone (wolf D# to Bb).<br/><a href="http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tunes/tunes.htm">http://members.nbci.com/tune_smithy/tunes/tunes.htm</a></p><p>The ear training quiz should work, yes. Show a couple of arpeggio windows, then click on the tied<br/>quaver button in the main window to show the Scale / Arpeggio config window (alternatively, Ctrl +<br/>click on the play button for either of the arp. windows). Look at bottom right of the Scale /<br/>Arpeggio config window (above the play button), and you should see a &quot;Randomize for quiz&quot; button.</p><p>Click on that and it will play one of the arpeggios chosen at random, at random transposition in the<br/>scale.</p><p>If you don&apos;t see the button, it means there&apos;s a bug somewhere which I&apos;ll have to fix.</p><p>Quick summary, if it is a bug: try first File | Save As | bug.ini to save all the settings to the<br/>file bug.ini, then File | REset check boxes etc, and see if that fixes it. If it does, I&apos;ll want to<br/>see the bug.ini file. You can open bug.ini again to get back to your previous settings for all the<br/>check boxes etc.</p><p>Just seen your post to the TL. Yes, you are welcome to add direct link to my 17-tet midi clip to<br/>your page.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
