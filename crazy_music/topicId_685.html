It can be used to model things in the real world,<br/>and it gives helps us build things like airplanes, TVs, and<br/>computers.  Thus, it is a tool.  The fact that models are<br/>never perfect, or that humans can apply models incorrectly<br/>doesn&apos;t change this.</p><p>&gt;     The most obvious example of this is the Banach-Tarski<br/>&gt; Theorem.</p><p>The theorem is correct.  The paradox came about when somebody<br/>forgot that it assumes matter is infinitely divisible.  Real<br/>matter is not infinitely divisible.  Yet, the theorem has<br/>useful application in areas such as cryptography.</p><p>&gt; However, the most vivid recent example is the economic work<br/>&gt; leading to the Nobel Prize awarded Merton and Scholes for their<br/>&gt; Balck-Merton-Scholes options pricing equation.</p><p>I&apos;m not familiar with this, but it sounds like the model they<br/>were using didn&apos;t take into account that pricing is an<br/>iterative process involving feedback, as you say.</p><p>&gt;      Math is not a tool. It is a fabrication of the human mind,<br/>&gt; as Cohen&apos;s 1964 proof of the invalidity of hte Zermelo-Fraenkel<br/>&gt; theorem under certain conditions showed so clearly.</p><p>It is a fabrication of the human mind, and it can be a tool.<br/>As a tool, it can be used correctly or incorrectly.</p><p>&gt;         Math is as useless in explaining music as it is useless in<br/>&gt; trying to explain or predict the hemlines of women&apos;s dresses, or<br/>&gt; the hot new form of pop music in 5 years.</p><p>Math itself will never explain anything.  It doesn&apos;t attempt to.</p><p>&gt;          just study the dizzying spiral into incoherence followed<br/>&gt; by Milton Babbitt and Pierre Boulez and their pseudo-scientific<br/>&gt; epigones,</p><p>I long ago concluded that both of these guys were spouting useless<br/>nonsense.</p><p>-Carl</p></div>
