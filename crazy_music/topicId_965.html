This is far easier than my first thoughts about what<br/>&gt; &gt; you were sayiang. Just a matter of assigning a scale / mode<br/>&gt; &gt; to one of the channels as the root channel, working out the<br/>&gt; &gt; position relative to 1/1 in usual way, then multiply all the<br/>&gt; &gt; notes played by the resulting value.  That would do the<br/>&gt; &gt; tonality diamond just as it is - play the control note<br/>&gt; &gt; and note on the main keyboard, and you&apos;ll hear the product.</p><p>&gt; Right.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Then for e.g. mean-tone modulation of j.i. scale, I suppose<br/>&gt; &gt; one will want e.g. the A of the main keyboard to still sound<br/>&gt; &gt; an A whatever the root of the j.i. scale is, e.g. if root<br/>&gt; &gt; key pressed is the F, you play the A as a 5/4 above the meantone F.<br/>&gt; &gt; That would require all of another couple of lines of code or<br/>&gt; &gt; something!</p><p>&gt; I don&apos;t think so -- it&apos;s still just mulitplication.</p><p>Extra lines are so that it is played as an A as 5/4 above the F when<br/>F key is pressed in the root channel and A in the main channel.</p><p>If you had the same scheme as for the tonality diamond,<br/>you&apos;d press an F in the root channel and an E in the main<br/>channel to get an A at 5/4 above the F (this assumes one did it<br/>so that C played sim. in both channels sounds a C,<br/>then C + E = E, C# + E = F 5/4 above C#, D + E = F# 5/4 above D,<br/>and so on).</p><p>....</p><p>&gt; There&apos;s more than too many good ideas out there to code...<br/>&gt; anyone beats me to it, and I&apos;ll send him flowers.</p><p>That&apos;s true.

No score entry software I know of even<br/>&gt; claims to support this behavior.</p><p>Ah, this last you can do with midi relaying, to reasonable first<br/>approx. I use it all the time, using NoteworthyComposer (which<br/>happens to be the score editor I use), but it will work with any.</p><p>Just add a note to the score saying what mapping you use, which<br/>can be any mapping of midi notes of the stave to pitches that<br/>you like. That&apos;s for oneself, so that you will know what mapping to use in<br/>future, by reading the score.</p><p>Then relay it with that mapping. I use Hubi&apos;s loopback, a free software<br/>driver that relays midi out of one prog. to midi in of another. I think<br/>there is another driver that does the same thing. Or one could just add<br/>cable round from midi out to midi in of soundcard; I expect that would<br/>work too, but less convenient. (The FTS Midi In help page gives url for<br/>Hubi&apos;s loopback and says how it is installed, if anyone wants to know,<br/>or I could repeat it here; come to think of it, maybe I&apos;ll add note about<br/>all this to the tunes web page).</p><p>If you look at the scores for most of the pieces on my tunes page, then you&apos;ll<br/>see that they are done this way.</p><p><a href="http://robertinventor.tripod.com/tunes/tunes.htm">http://robertinventor.tripod.com/tunes/tunes.htm</a><br/>Tunes page is moving here as I found netfirms don&apos;t allow zips / .exe<br/>/ files over 1 Mb for banner supported sites.</p><p>You&apos;ll see they are just 12-tet ordinary type scores. I made them in NWC,<br/>just as one would for any score, and added the midi relay note to the score<br/>(I put them in a lyric line), then I relay them using the mapping<br/>shown.</p><p>So I can play them any time just by setting up the mapping<br/>in FTS and playing them in NWC. In fact one could also save them<br/>as 12-tet midi files and relay them with the mapping from those too.</p><p>I&apos;m surprised how few seem to use this technique. Mats Oljare does,<br/>using Graham Breed&apos;s program for midi relaying in his case.</p><p>In use, it is just like a normal score editor. After editing to add<br/>a note or phrase, or changes etc, you click the play button and hear<br/>it played in the usual way, and because of the midi relaying,<br/>you hear it with the correct re-mapped pitches for the lines of the stave.</p><p>I often do it so that repeats of the scale are shown as octaves in the score,<br/>so if it is say, 6 notes pad the scale out with one extra note to make it<br/>a 7 note scale, and relay it from successive white notes.</p><p>If say 11 notes, then do it as a 12 note scale with last note duplicated,<br/>and relay it from successive midi notes. If more than 12, then one can<br/>use two octaves for each repeat.</p><p>If non octave scale, may do it so that the non octave repeat is shown<br/>as &quot;octaves&quot; on the score.</p><p>Or sometimes, I just do it so successive white notes map to notes of the<br/>scale - so that playing white notes on keyboard is like playing it<br/>on a harp. That could be useful if the score is going to be read by<br/>a harpist with a retuned harp.</p><p>It is only a first approx because a proper microtonal score editor<br/>would let one vary the number of lines in the stave and things like<br/>that, and use microtonal accidentals and so forth. However,<br/>not too bad, because you can hitch into all the facilities of<br/>the existing score editor for everything else except the pitches,<br/>such as respecting dynamics / tempi / flow direction on playback.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Well, I have been thinking that when I code this, may be an idea<br/>&gt; &gt; to make sure one can have add three or more manuals too, each<br/>&gt; &gt; with it&apos;s own scale, so best not want to hard code the number 2<br/>&gt; &gt; into it.</p><p>&gt; Yes, absolutely.  Especially if it is to be extended to score<br/>&gt; entry, where control staffs may abound!</p><p>&gt; I should say that the idea of multiple, nested control staffs<br/>&gt; is due to Denny Genovese, circa 1997.</p><p>Well, I suppose it could be useful if someone was using root control staffs<br/>in a score editor, which one could do if it was set up like this<br/>by midi relaying through FTS as in the way described. Just<br/>add note to the score to say which of the staffs are the root control staffs,<br/>and which scales they are moving the root by, and set up the midi<br/>relaying accordingly.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Come to think of it, that also fits in with multiple scales ideas<br/>&gt; &gt; assigned to channels - because one could just comma shift the<br/>&gt; &gt; keyboards, but more generally, one would do it so that one can<br/>&gt; &gt; have any scale / mode mapping to each.
