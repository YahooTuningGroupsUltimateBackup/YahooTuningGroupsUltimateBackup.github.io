Listeners just don&apos;t seem to have much trouble hearing the<br/>&gt; 9-equal 133 1/3-cent interval as a recognizable &quot;semitone,&quot; nor in<br/>&gt; hearing even such compressed intervals as the 19-equal 63.15-cent<br/>&gt; interval as a recognizable &quot;semitone&quot; under the right musical<br/>&gt; conditions.</p><p>Hi Brian,</p><p>I was going to say something about 19-EDO when I first responded<br/>to Margo&apos;s post about 28:27.</p><p>In my _19-tone Samba_, I use a chord progression in which the<br/>~63-cent 19-equal &quot;semitone&quot; features prominently, The C#--&gt;C<br/>and B--&gt;Bb in the inner voices are both ~63 cents.</p><p>You can hear the mp3 and read about it at:<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/19tet/19samba.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/19tet/19samba.htm</a></p><p>(I believe you were actually one of the first people to hear<br/>this, because I wrote it at the Sonic Arts Gallery in 1998,<br/>around the time you were visiting.)</p><p>I found it interesting that my ears accept these small<br/>~63-cent semitones as functional plain &apos;ol semitones.<br/>I almost don&apos;t notice how small they are.  One of the<br/>mystifying things about 19-EDO, and one reason why I like<br/>it so much.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
