I just want to get e-mails<br/>&gt; about updates, beta versions, etc.</p><p>Okay, I wonder, maybe the others will feel the same, as that<br/>was the description of the listbot one.</p><p>I can do it so that only the owner can post. Have to move<br/>from listbot as they are closing down their free service.</p><p>Indeed, done so: Announcement/Newsletter (Moderators can post<br/>messages)</p><p>You may want to wait until I&apos;ve reposted the old messages,<br/>or I could add you to the e-mails list to be sent invitation<br/>to join.</p><p>If anyone wants a discussion type group as well, I can do<br/>a separate one for that.</p><p>&gt; &gt;I&apos;ll prob. include it anyway if it is only going to be a few lines<br/>&gt; &gt;and a tick box. Could perhaps use it for exploring lattices too e.g.<br/>&gt; &gt;successive white keys of one keyboard go up 5/4, of another,<br/>&gt; &gt;3/2, etc. Or whatever,... Just a thought, don&apos;t know if that<br/>&gt; &gt;will be useful to do.</p><p>&gt; Def.</p><p>Okay, will do.</p><p>&gt; But this also destroys something else the 12-tet composer is<br/>&gt; used to seeing... the chords of the diatonic scale looking the<br/>&gt; same anywhere on the staff!!</p><p>True.</p><p>&gt; Having successive scale notes mapped to successive staff positions<br/>&gt; is very important to me as a composer... plenty enough to give up<br/>&gt; the location of my octaves.</p><p>Fine. Anyway it is something one can decide when one starts work on<br/>the piece, and isn&apos;t inherent in the method one way or the other.<br/>I can see the point.</p><p>Perhaps I&apos;m approaching this more from performer perspective<br/>- I like to be able to easily read the score and try to play<br/>a part on some instrument or indeed on retuned keyboard, and<br/>I find that easier if the octaves of score are in the place<br/>I expect them. Just habit of course and one could prob. learn<br/>not to expect that, and get used to various spacings for the<br/>&quot;octave&quot;.</p><p>&gt; &gt; Already downloaded a couple of the pdfs from anaphoria<br/>&gt; &gt; to puzzle over!</p><p>&gt; That list was in order... Wilson&apos;s stuff is the last stuff you&apos;d<br/>&gt; want to read on the topic.</p><p>Okay fine. However, as web addresses, were the first ones I went to!<br/>Thanks again.</p><p>Robert</p></div>
