(I have all except the early ones).</p><p>I could also get it to generate a list of the e-mail addresses of all those<br/>who posted, since the complete e-mail addresses are shown in the digests,<br/>and then we could mail to them all and ask if they are happy for their posts to<br/>be re-posted, which would also be a way of letting everyone know about the<br/>new group (as some of the members don&apos;t belong to the tuning list).</p><p>I haven&apos;t quite figured out how to program to send an e-mail with the<br/>original author of the post as the apparent originator of the<br/>e-mail, so the re-posted messages would all have to show up<br/>under my name as author, but would be shown as forwarded messages</p><p>Like this:</p><p>In messages listings:</p><p>Author: Robert Walker<br/>Subject: FW: Re: Wooden frets?! - David J.

If you go over that<br/>number, then Yahoo&apos;s detection system for auto-responding<br/>goes into effect.</p><p>Yahoo&apos;s problem here is the &quot;I am on vacation&quot; type message<br/>that some people set as an automatic response to an incoming<br/>e-mail. Suppose also they are on individual e-mail subscription.<br/>Their p.c. gets an e-mail from a Yahoo group, replies with the<br/>&quot;I am on vacation&quot; response, that gets relayed back to them<br/>as a post from the group, their p.c. replies to that saying<br/>&quot;I am on vacation&quot; again, ...</p><p>So, would upload at rate of one message every 30 seconds, say,<br/>then 450 messages would take getting on for four hours.</p><p>Maybe more - e.g. if my ISP disconnects (as it can) and I have<br/>to reconnect.</p><p>I could warn you about it in advance, and we could all switch to no<br/>e-mail mode, (or get Jeff to do it for us) while it happened.</p><p>However, that seems an awkward solution.</p><p>A better idea, if we want to do this, might be to do it the other way round<br/>- I&apos;d ask Jeff to make another group, say, new_crazy_music<br/>then before anyone joins it, I&apos;d forward all the posts from PMG to it.</p><p>When that was all done, I&apos;d let you know, and then Jeff can rename crazy_music<br/>to crazy_music_was, and then rename the new_crazy_music to crazy_music.</p><p>Then we all rejoin crazy_music.</p><p>Then finally, I can repost all the messages from crazy_music_was to crazy_music,<br/>and there we are, all the posts from PMG in chronological order, followed by<br/>the ones from crazy_music.</p><p>Anyway, no idea whether this the thing to do, it&apos;s something to discuss, but<br/>it may be of interest to know that it can be done if we do decide on it.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=36 href="#36">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2001 5:33:22 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kraig!</p><p>&gt;  Yes i am so happy that all of Brian&apos;s messages were saved and that we can invite him here also.<br/>Now isn&apos;t that nice and friendly</p><p>We can leave out all his messages if that&apos;s the consensus, as I imagine it might<br/>be; just not repost them.</p><p>N.B. I wonder if you know, I removed the digests from tuning_gossip. Haven&apos;t actually<br/>read them, and was told that they weren&apos;t really that great things to propogate,<br/>plus consideration that there is no implied permission to be able to repost<br/>messages in this way, since the p.m. archives weren&apos;t open to the public, though<br/>membership was.</p><p>I&apos;m sorry about what I did; I think now that perhaps it was unwise.</p><p>If we did go ahead with this, I think one would need to ask everyone else involved<br/>if they were happy for their posts to be reposted, and maybe just leave out all<br/>his posts - as far as I know they were all off topic anyway for the main focus<br/>of what the list was about.</p><p>Another possibility would be to use my program to make an archive out of all the<br/>digests, and circulate the zip to anyone who wants it who used to belong to<br/>the PMG.</p><p>I&apos;m told some of the material he posted just possibly might be libelous,<br/>so not too keen to be involved in propogating it, so I&apos;d leave his posts<br/>out of the zip too, just to be on the safe side.</p><p>It&apos;s one thing to provide a place where someone can speak freely.
