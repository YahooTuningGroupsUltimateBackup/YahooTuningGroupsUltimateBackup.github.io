Yet the exact same musical<br/>confidence game continues, today--right now. Robert Morris&apos; music<br/>theory article &quot;Compositional Spaces and Other Territories,&quot; from<br/>Perspectives of New Music, Vol. 39, 1995, pp.  329-358,<br/>perpetuates the exact same kind of 1950s meaningless pseudo-<br/>scientific jargon and the exact same sort of technical-sounding<br/>yet musically empty quasi-mathematical gibberish...the same tired<br/>old musical con job practiced by Karlheinz Stockhausen in the<br/>1950s, by John Cage in the 1960s, by Pierre Boulez in the 1970.<br/>It&apos;s merely been brushed off, polished up and trotted out to dupe<br/>yet another generation of gullible young composers and naive<br/>music student dupes.<br/>   In his 1995 article, Morris writes:<br/>   &quot;A closer look at the realization reveals a functional<br/>distinction between notes of long and short duration. Long notes,<br/>sustained by at least one of the participating instruments, are<br/>circled in the underlying design to show that each aggregate<br/>projects its own ordered hexachord.  The inside aggregates<br/>(numbers  2 and 3) project transformations of the first hexachord<br/>of  the generating row; the long notes in the outside aggregates<br/>project hexachords related to one another by T sub 1 1 but not to<br/>the hexachords of the P row. If this were an excerpt from an<br/>actual piece, these Q hexachords might be a reference to some<br/>other hexachord in the word or even some other piece of music.&quot;<br/>[Morris, Robert, op cit, 1995]</p><p>   Empirical tests of listeners&apos; reponses prove (as usual) that<br/>such jabberwocky has nothing to do with the piece of music as<br/>heard by listeners.</p><p>   &quot;Working on the basis of Allen Forte&apos;s very influential<br/>application of set theory to music (1973), Robert Morris has<br/>developed a computational &grave;rationale for the selection of sets<br/>that insure predictable degrees of aural similitude&apos; (Morris<br/>1980: 446), and this has been tested empirically by Cheryl<br/>Bruner. Her conclusion is that Morris&apos;s system does not succeed<br/>in its aim, because &grave;the perception of similarity among<br/>contemporary pitch structures seems to be tied to the context in<br/>which the structures are presented.&apos; (1984: 38.) Or to put it<br/>another way, formal classifications of pitch-class context do not<br/>suffice to specify the context within which musical sounds are<br/>heard as similar or dissimilar, coherent or incoherent.&quot; [Cook,<br/>Nicholas. Music, Imagination, and Culture. Clarendon Press:<br/>Oxford, 1990, pg. 234]</p><p>   Robert Morris&apos; 1995 article offers us a magnificent case study<br/>of incoherence, double-talk and obscurantism. What is an<br/>&quot;aggregate&quot;?  How does it &quot;project&quot; its own &quot;underlying<br/>hexachord&quot;?  How can one &quot;project&quot; a transformation?<br/>In analytic and projective geometry, the term &quot;projection&quot; has<br/>a specific meaning, but it is not used in its accustomed<br/>mathematical sense in Morris&apos; article.  Instead, Morris&apos; use of<br/>the term &quot;projection&quot; has no discoverable connection with<br/>mathematics, physics or geometry. What are &quot;inside aggregrates&quot;<br/>as opposed to &quot;outside aggregates&quot;?  What are they inside of?<br/>What are they outside of? Morris do not bother to define any of<br/>these terms before he tosses them into his verbal sewage-spill.<br/>In particular, the phrase &quot;the long notes of the outside<br/>aggregates project hexachords related to one another by T sub 1 1<br/>but not to the hexachords of the P row&quot; stands out as an<br/>apotheosis of unintelligibility.   Is there any point in trying<br/>to decipher mathematical terms which are not used mathematically?<br/>Is there any sense in trying to unravel pseudo-scientific jargon<br/>whose sole purpose is to  render the meaning (if any) opaque?<br/>   How much of an egg do you have to eat before you realize it&apos;s<br/>rotten?<br/>------<br/>   Modernist ideology in music qualifies as a superstition because<br/>the prime tenets of musical moderism constantly flout the evidence<br/>provided by science about physical acoustics and the physiology<br/>of the human ear.<br/>   Serialism uses too many modal tones--12 in all. It violates<br/>Miller&apos;s number &quot;seven plus or minus two&quot;--the basic bit rate<br/>which limits the capacity of humans to absorb audible<br/>information. Total serialism compounds the violation of human<br/>perceptual capacity:</p><p>   &quot;Immediate memory for digits, letters of the alphabet and<br/>words was investigated extensively in Wundt&apos;s laboratory at<br/>Leipzig at the end of the nineteenth century. If you were to hear<br/>a string of letters read to you just once at a rate of 2 letters<br/>per second, how many items would you recall? Wundt (1905), like<br/>many later workers, found the number of items that could be<br/>recalled in the correct order, the span of immediate memory, to<br/>be about 6 &apos;single impressions.&apos; The repeated findings in a<br/>variety of studies that people could recall between 5 and 9<br/>items, whether the items were letters, digits, or words, led<br/>Miller (1956) to argue than the span of immediate memory was,<br/>typically, 7 plus or minus 2.&quot; [Smyth, Mary M., Alan F. Collins,<br/>Peter E. Morris and Philip Levy. Cognition in Action. 2nd ed.,<br/>Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers: Howe, 1995, pg. 156]</p><p>   Atonal modernist music, by favoring vertical intervals which<br/>fall within 1/4 of the critical bandwidth , produces unavoidable<br/>audible roughness, which again creates innate human responses<br/>which cannot be argued out of existence or changed by Pavolvian<br/>musical conditioning. The disregard for the evidence of<br/>psychoacoustics, cognitive psychology, physical acoustics and the<br/>physiology of the ear is near-universal among modernist<br/>composers like Stockhausen.  So why should we expect Stockhausen  and his ilk to offer apprporiate humane responses to the stimuli  of the real world, when they have never been willing to give approriate humane reponses to their grindingly dissonant<br/>and dehumanized musical stimuli?  Listento &quot;Kreuzspiel&quot; or &quot;Gruppen.&quot;  You decide.<br/>-----<br/>   Joseph Pehrson has commented that Stockhausen&apos;s early<br/>electronic works prove interesting. That&apos;s certainly one opinion.<br/>For my part, Stockhausen&apos;s shorter electronic compositions from<br/>the 1950s remain tolerable -- &quot;Studie I&quot; and &quot;Studie II&quot; and<br/>&quot;Kontakte&quot; (the 1956 tape version of Kontake, not the later<br/>acoustic version).<br/>   However, even these early electronic compositions eventually<br/>become wearing. I hear no audible organization in any of<br/>Stockhausen&apos;s pre-1970 compositions, whether acoustic or<br/>electronic. The electronic pieces sound novel and provide some<br/>moemntarily diverting timbres, but the general incoherence soons<br/>grows unutterably wearisome.  Despite all the yapping about how<br/>Stockhausen&apos;s early electronic pieces are &quot;masterpieces,&quot; they<br/>don&apos;t hold a candle to genuine early electronic masterpieces like<br/>Ussachevsky &amp; Luening&apos;s &quot;Sonic Contours&quot; or &quot;Moonflight&quot; or<br/>&quot;Invocation,&quot; or for that matter Dockstader&apos;s really tremendous<br/>electronic compositions &quot;Quatermass&quot; and &quot;Luna Park,&quot;  or Pierre<br/>Schaefer&apos;s &quot;Etude Aux Chemins de Fer.&quot;<br/>    Overall, the French electronic composers completely blow the<br/>German electronic composers out of the water. In retrospect,<br/>after 50 years of history, there&apos;s just no question that Scheafer<br/>and Henry created electronic music with infinitely more emotional<br/>power and musical coherence than the random-sounding incoherent<br/>bloops and bleeps churned out by Stockhausen and his Darmstadt<br/>buddies.<br/>    By the way, you can buy Tod Dockstader&apos;s electronic music as<br/>well as the superb CD &quot;Pioneers of Electronic Music&quot; with plenty<br/>of early 1950s Ussachevsky &amp; Luening, as well as the complete<br/>electronic music of Pierre Schaefer, at <a href="http://www.cdemusic.org">www.cdemusic.org</a>.  I<br/>highly recommend all these pieces.<br/>    As for Karlheinz Stockhausen&apos;s megalomania, that&apos;s another<br/>issue. Post-Beethoven German composers have all suffered from<br/>increasing megalomania as a group: whether you look at Wagner or<br/>Reger or Schoenberg or Stockhausen, these campers have all got<br/>some serious Froot Loops in their little musical bowls. This<br/>history of increasing megalmaniacal craziness on the part of<br/>late 19th century-early 20th century German composers seems to trace back to the invividous influence of the Prussian midnset on the<br/>Germanic character proper. In large part, this peculiarly<br/>Germanic pathology results  from the philosophical influence of<br/>Friedrich Herder by way of Fichte into Hegel and thence (in a<br/>sinister example of cultural chromosome-jumping) to the Ivy League<br/>crypto-fascists who espoused  &quot;scientific racism&quot; in America as<br/>the perverted basis of modern  American mass education.<br/>    More about that latter in a subsequent post -- ditto its<br/>depraved effects on the modern American unviersity, in particular<br/>the modern American college music department.<br/>-----<br/>    One final point: not many people are aware that Karlheinz<br/>Stockhausen suffered a mental breakdown in 1970. When he emerged from (shall we say, to put it politely) his &quot;rest,&quot;  his<br/>music changed radically. Suddenly Karlheinz started producing<br/>hippy-dippy-type &quot;happenings&quot; like &quot;Sirius&quot; and &quot;Sternklang&quot; and<br/>&quot;Kurzwellen.&quot;  The interested modern music fan may find it<br/>informative to trace the connection twixt the ever-more-<br/>convoluted and theoretically incoherent hypercomplexity of<br/>Stockhausen&apos;s 1950s modernist compositions and his fate in 1970.<br/>Whole tomes could be written about this connection.<br/>    One highly placed IRCAMista remarked to me some years back:<br/>&quot;Don&apos;t tell anyone, but I think he&apos;s [Stockhausen is] out of his<br/>mind.&quot;<br/>     A fitting epitaph for the dead fanatical musical ideology of<br/>Schoenberg, Boulez, Babbitt, Stockhausen, et al.  From now on,<br/>let&apos;s check the Germans for box cutters before they board the<br/>airplane called &quot;modern music.&quot;<br/>---------<br/>     As for 55-equal -- you might find it amusing to note that 55<br/>equal, called &quot;the musician&apos;s tuning,&quot; was championed loudly by<br/>Telemann and Sorge and others during the 18th century. 12 out of<br/>55 equal received wide praise among the elite musicians of<br/>Central Germany.  55 got plenty of press probably because its<br/>step-size approximates the syntonic comma (81/80) pretty well.<br/>Around the same time 51 equal also got some good reviews, since<br/>51 equal approximates the size of the Pythagorean comma pretty<br/>well.<br/>    As a compromise twixt 51 and 55, 53-equal got considerable<br/>attention from Sauveur and von Janko and others. 53 equal still<br/>gets lots of adulation from fanatical 5-limit JI ideologues<br/>nowadays.  Of course, real composers in the real world recognize<br/>that all of these tunings are simply heard as &quot;a whole buncha<br/>small intervals&quot; by listeners and practicing composers alike.<br/>Once you get past about 29 equal, hands-on experience composing<br/>in these equal temperaments shows that there&apos;s no significant<br/>audible musical difference between (say) 51 as opposed to 55 or<br/>53, or 60 as opposed to 65.<br/>    Not many people have done anything with the full chromatic<br/>set of 55 equal, or for that matter other nearby chromatic sets<br/>like 60 equal or 65 equal. 72 has proven much more popular,<br/>probably since it&apos;s relatively easy to get 72 by rolling a bunch<br/>of harps next to one another (James Tenney) or pianos (Carrillo)<br/>etc.<br/>   Robert Walker deserves praise for epxloring a relatively<br/>exotic tuning system. How about trying some of the more notable<br/>and beautiful but lesser-used equal divisions of the octave,<br/>Robert?  For example, 9 equal?  Or 15 equal?  Or 10 equal?  Or 21<br/>equal?<br/>---------<br/>  One last issue -- LIME by Lipppold Haaken incorporates<br/>microtonal accidentals. WHen you pair the LIME notation program<br/>witht he FB-01, you get the ONLY *true* microtonal musical<br/>notation in existence. LIME will actually send microtonal pitches<br/>to the FB-01!<br/>  Why not try getting in touch with Lippold, Robert, and see if<br/>you can get him to hook your FTS into LIME in some way?<br/>  Shouldn&apos;t be that hard. And if you and Lippold can do that,<br/>you&apos;d have a truly awesome microtonal notation program *that*<br/>*actually* *sends* *microtonal* *pitches* *to* *the*<br/>*sythesizer*!!!<br/>---------<br/>--mclaren</p></div><h3><a id=1121 href="#1121">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>10/5/2001 8:38:54 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., xed@e... wrote:</p><p><a href="/crazy_music/topicId_1120.html#1120">/crazy_music/topicId_1120.html#1120</a></p><p>Many thanks to Brian McLaren for his fascinating essay on Stockhausen<br/>and &quot;traditional&quot; musical modernism.

However, the relationship of this modernist art<br/>and &quot;sensational&quot; visual art was also not entirely clear to me.

With that in mind, I thought 35, 55, and 77 would all be<br/>good places to go exploring as they have interesting embedded<br/>ets. Tuning up and listenning to some of these didn&apos;t quite<br/>light my fire, oh well... (the comment from Brian, when I<br/>talked about some et or other was &quot;its too bad its prime&quot;.
