Who is Miller Puckette,<br/>and where does he come from?<br/>   Puckette helped produce the algorithmic graphic<br/>software application MAX. At present MAX enjoys<br/>very wide popularity among college music students,<br/>as well as among new music composers who use<br/>technology. MAX runs only on Macintosh computers,<br/>and the current version of MAX runs only on Power<br/>Macs. (An older version of MAX exists but you<br/>cannot buy it, nor does the company support it.)<br/>   Puckette comes out of the IRCAM/CCRMA<br/>computer music environment. However, he appears<br/>to have rebelled against the compile/listen paradigm<br/>of computer music. That older mode of making<br/>computer music required composers to painstakingly<br/>type in many thousands of numerical parameters,<br/>submit the batch job to a minicomputer, then wait<br/>for hours or days while the job compiled, then<br/>(only much later) listen to the resulting audio output,<br/>make changes to the numerical score, and do the<br/>whole shmear over again.<br/>   Like many other computer musicians of his<br/>generation, Puckette quickly tired of the compile/listen<br/>cycle because he found the extreme length of time<br/>twixt writing the numerical score and hearing the<br/>output counterintuitive and difficult to deal with.<br/>Puckette belongs to the second generation of computer<br/>music composers.  The first generation (Max Mathews,<br/>John Chowning, Paul Lansky, et al.) grew up with<br/>large mainframe computers and assembly code<br/>scores. To the first generation of computer musicians,<br/>being able to type english-like numbers and letters into<br/>a score represented a huge breakthrough in usability,<br/>even if it meant having to wait weeks in order to hear<br/>the compiled audio output.<br/>   The second generation of computer musicians (Puckette,<br/>Barry Vercoe, Barry Truax, et al.) grew up with faster<br/>smaller minicomputers which could sometimes run simple<br/>numerical scores in real time (viz., Barry Truax&apos;s PDP-10-based<br/>system in Toronto Canada). This taste of real-time audio output<br/>led many of the second generation computer musicians to<br/>search for ways to produce real-time output using MIDI<br/>(MIDI appeared in 1983, and the minicomputer-based<br/>computer music systems became common in the late 1970s).<br/>This led to applications like Miller Puckette&apos;s MAX.<br/>    MAX does not generate or leave behind a written musical<br/>score. Instead, you hook together graphical modules on<br/>a Macintosh computer screen and then set the thing going.<br/>The MAX application will then do its thing in real time.<br/>Recently, an add-on for MAX has appeared. This add-on<br/>can perform digital audio operations on incoming sounds<br/>if the Power Mac is fast enough. The digital audio operations<br/>include Fourier analysis/resynthesis, digital reverb, digital<br/>echo, spectral operations like spectral inversion, and so on.<br/>All of these operations can be performed in real time on<br/>sounds as they come into the Power Mac, and all these<br/>digital audio operations are directed by a MAX graphical<br/>&quot;score&quot; which consists of various digital audio software<br/>modules plugged into one another.<br/>   At present, Puckette is a faculty member at UCSD. The<br/> UCSD music department has one of the worst reputations<br/>of any in the United States. (Many have said THE worst.)<br/>   The UCSD computer music department is a vast sinkhole<br/>for tax money that turned out to be largely wasted. F. R. Moore<br/>was hired from Bell Labs in 1979 to create (from scratch) a<br/>huge computer music system. He produced a total mess. Unlike<br/>Max Mathews&apos; MUSIC V or Barry Vercoe&apos;s Csound, Moore&apos;s<br/>Cmusic is such a badly botched programming job that it never went<br/>anywhere. (A digital thalidomide child.) Consisting of many hundreds<br/>of scattered files, cmusic  runs slowly, does what it does poorly, and<br/>requires enormously greater computer resources to do the<br/>same things that Vercoe&apos;s Csound does with much less RAM<br/>and processor power. Also, Moore&apos;s Cmusic does not run<br/>on Windows or Mac machines -- only UNIX/LINUX, _unlike_<br/>Vercoe&apos;s Csound.<br/>    The UCSD music department remains infamous nationwide as<br/>an altar at which composers and students alike are required<br/>to abase themselves to the European so-called &quot;avant<br/>garde&quot; of the 1930s-1950s. (How the 70-year-old ideas and<br/>music of dead European composers can be considered &quot;avant<br/>garde&quot; today, no one has succeeded in explaining.) The UCSD<br/>music department offers an intensely mathematical music curriculum,<br/>stressing math over talent, logic and diagrams and number-lists<br/>over intuition, and Euroschlock musical ideology over passion.<br/>   Concerts of UCSD music represent the most ideologically<br/>narrow form of modern music, with no discernible melodies<br/>and no perceptible rhythmic pulse and no functional harmonies<br/>and no audible organization.  In short, the UCSD music department<br/>seems stuck in time in the year 1950, like one of those chrononauts<br/>in a science fiction story whose time machine breaks down and<br/>leaves him stranded in the past.<br/>   ---<br/>   Given this context, what can we conclude about<br/>Miller Puckette&apos;s discussion of so-called &quot;new music&quot;?</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>    Miller Puckette appears to subscribe to the &quot;crisis theory&quot; of<br/>modern music. According to this belief system, 20th century (and<br/>early 21st century music) suffers from a catastrophic systemic<br/>problem. This alleged &quot;crisis&quot; supposedly affects all new music.<br/>The alleged &quot;crisis&quot; is supposedly worsening, leading to some<br/>final (but unspecified) musical cataclysm.  The alleged &quot;crisis&quot; in<br/>new music arises from supposed historical processes operating<br/>primarily in Europe during the 20th century. The alleged &quot;crisis&quot;<br/>in new music supposedly threatens the very existence of all new<br/>music everywhere, and the continued survival of all composers<br/>of so-called &quot;new music.&quot;<br/>    Puckette&apos;s &quot;crisis theory&quot; belief system reveals itself in<br/>passages<br/>such as:  &quot;To ask, &grave;Who cares if you listen,&apos; is to open and peer<br/>inside the forbidden closet. The skeleton inside has twelve ribs.<br/>Run a mallet down them to hear the sound of 20th century academic<br/>music in the USA.&quot;</p><p>   Is Puckette&apos;s &quot;crisis theory&quot; of modern music accurate?<br/>   Does a &quot;crisis theory&quot; describe the actual history of 20th<br/>century music?<br/>   Let&apos;s look at the facts:<br/>   Miller Puckette&apos;s belief system appears to be a rehash of a<br/>European belief system first offered in the very early 20th century.<br/>Indeed,  a long line of (mostly European) modernist ideologues have<br/>purveyed this &quot;crisis theory&quot; of modern music. Starting with the<br/>Viennese kook, who ran around screaming &quot;The end of tonality<br/>is coming! The end of tonality is coming!&quot; and proceeding to the<br/>Darmstadt kook (who suffered a mental breakdown in 1970<br/>requiring prolonged institutionalization) and on to the Princeton kook<br/>(who has admitted publicly that his set-theory efforts to place modern<br/>music on a &quot;scientific basis&quot; failed, and whose pitch class<br/>set concoctions have been so widely criticized for their<br/>intellectual shoddiness as well as their musical incoherence) and<br/>thence to the Parisian kook who founded IRCAM (for scathing<br/>reviews of the Parisian&apos;s kook&apos;s musical output see variously<br/>The Musical Times, London, 1960, and The New York Times,<br/>1991), each of these musical cranks marched up and down<br/>the street carrying placards which read THE END OF TONALITY<br/>IS COMING.<br/>   In the case of the Parisian kook, for example, we may<br/>cite the notorious 1950 article in which he declared &quot;Any<br/>composer who does not recognize the absolute necessity of<br/>the twelve-tone method is USELESS!&quot;  In the case of the<br/>Princeton kook, Miller Puckette has already cited the<br/>infamous article &quot;Who Cares If You Listen?&quot; (which would<br/>seem to require no further comment)...and in the case of<br/>the Darmstadt kook we may cite commentary from sources<br/>as varied as James Backus and Leonard B. Meyer which<br/>unanimously characterizes the Darmstadt kook&apos;s writings on<br/>music as &quot;meaningless jargon&quot; which &quot;uses the terminology<br/>of science but without its customary scientific meaning,&quot; (Backus,<br/>PNM, 1963) &quot;vacuous fustian,&quot; (Meyer,  &quot;Music, the Arts, and<br/>Ideas,&quot; 1956) and so on.<br/>    From this evidence, what may we conclude?<br/>    The simplest and most obvious conclusion is that  the<br/>so-called &quot;crisis theory&quot; of modern music is actually<br/>nothing more than an apocalyptic cult. Like all doomsday<br/>cults, this one proclaims &quot;THE END OF [fill in the blank]<br/>IS COMING!&quot;  (Here, the blank gets filled in with &quot;TONAL MUSIC.&quot;<br/>Elsewhere, the blank gets variously filled in with &quot;THE WORLD,&quot;<br/>&quot;THE WHITE RACE,&quot; &quot;THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY<br/>SYSTEM,&quot; etc., etc. ) Like all doomsday cults, the &quot;crisis theory&quot;<br/>of modern music makes predictions which uniformly fail to<br/>come true. For example, the followers of the Viennese<br/>kook have written &quot;Little children and mailmen<br/>will whistle our tunes&quot; -- Anton Webern, 1939, while followers<br/>of the Princeton kook have written &quot;The older or tonal<br/>system is no longer used by serious composers, having<br/>been replaced or superseded by the newer or serial<br/>system.&quot; -- Charles Wuorinen, Simple Composition, 1979,<br/>and the Parisian kook has written &quot;The composer&apos;s intuition<br/>is no longer sufficient to create music which is historically<br/>compelling; today the scientist and the engineer must<br/>collaborate with the composer...&quot; -- IRCAM press release,<br/>1977.<br/>    In each case, every one of these proclamations has failed<br/>to come true.  Contrary to the doomsday claims of the<br/>Viennese kook, the end of tonality stubbornly refused to arrive<br/>as scheduled, and subsequent generations of composers have<br/>not only abandoned serial rows as a viable compositional<br/>method but they have also largely given up listening to<br/>or even trying to defend the music of the Viennese kook<br/>and his immediate circle.(See &quot;Music of the 20th Century,&quot;<br/>New York Times, Dec. 2001, for a blistering 21st<br/>century reappraisal of the Viennese kook. &quot;Critics have<br/>exhausted every term in the lexicon of faint praise. Why<br/>don&apos;t they just admit they can&apos;t stand to listen to it?&quot; - ibid.)<br/>   Contrary to the apocalyptic claims of the Princeton<br/>kook and his followers, pitch-class set theory has been<br/>abandoned by younger composers as an unworkable<br/>scheme which generates insufferably boring music with<br/>no perceptible audible organization.<br/>   And contrary to the proclamations of the Parisian kook,<br/>the vast majority of composers continue to merrily compose<br/>exciting and vividly memorable music without feeling any need<br/>whatever to collaborate with scientists or engineers.<br/>Moreover, French scholars like Sorbonne Professor Laurent<br/>Fichet have gone so far as to inconveniently debunk such<br/>allegedly &quot;scientific&quot; musical schemes as those purveyed<br/>by the Parisian kook who founded IRCAM, showing them to<br/>be nothing more than abject pseudoscience on the<br/>level of Dianetics or ufology or cold fusion. [See &quot;Scientific<br/>Theories of Music In the 19th and 20th Century,&quot; Laurent<br/>Fichet, Paris, Librarie V. Brin, 1996.]<br/>   More -- contrary to the apocalyptic claims of the Parisisan<br/>kook, no major serious composer has ever emerged from<br/>IRCAM, and the overwhelming majority of the most widely<br/>applauded computer music has emerged (and continues<br/>to emergy, even today, in 2002) from venues *other* than<br/>IRCAM. (As for example the computer music of<br/>Richard Karpen, the computer music of William<br/>Scottstaedt, the computer music of John Chowning,<br/>the computer music of James Dashow, et al., none<br/>of them IRCAM denizens.) IRCAM&apos;s darling,  the<br/>composer Phillipe Manoury, has been roundly denigrated<br/>by just about every music critic and his musical output<br/>is justly regarded by the international new music<br/>community as trivial and musically meritricious. Indeed,<br/>the situation at IRCAM has become so dire that<br/>when the French Minister of the Interior went so far<br/>as to ask the Parisian kook to justify his annual IRCAM<br/>budget, the Parisian kook found himself required<br/>to pull political strings to force the French interior<br/>minister&apos;s resignation.  Needless to say, the Parisian<br/>kook got boxed into this exigency because he knew he<br/>could not justify IRCAM&apos;s budget, and thus had to<br/>shoot the messenger instead of fixing the problem.<br/>(See &quot;Rationalizing Music,&quot; 1995, for the full details<br/>of this scandal, among many other scandals afflicting IRCAM<br/>and the Parisian kook. The latest and most delicious scandal<br/>to erupt around the Parisian kook reportedly involved his arrest<br/>by Swiss police for terrorism in late 2001. Apparently the Parisian<br/>kook made a bomb threat against one of the many critics who<br/>wrote a savagely negative review of his music lo those many<br/>moons ago, and his bomb threat remained in his police jacket.)<br/>   Notice that in each and every case, the dire predictions of the<br/>apocalyptic musical cult failed to come true.<br/>   As with all doomsday cults, this failure of reality to converge<br/>with the cult ideology left the &quot;crisis theory&quot; cult in disarray.<br/>This in turn required drastic convulsions in order<br/>to re-write history and rearrange the numerology and the<br/>ideology in order to make the failed predictions appear to<br/>conform with the apocalyptic cult belief system.  This is also<br/>typical of doomsday cults. (For a detailed list of failed<br/>doomsday predictions made by cult leaders, and the subsequent<br/>doublethink and doubletalk required to make the failed predictions<br/>seem retroactively credible, see the appendix of James Randi&apos;s<br/>&quot;Encyclopedia of the Occult,&quot; 1996.)<br/>    The particular intellectual gyrations indulged in by the &quot;crisis<br/>theory&quot;<br/>cult of modern music include the usual dodges and doublethink<br/>scams familiar from ufology or Dianetics -- for example, the old<br/>warhorse &quot;make the prediction unfalsifiable.&quot;  In ufology, this<br/>dodge is used when the ufologist finds himself confronted by<br/>evidence that the UFO didn&apos;t show up on radar. &quot;Oh, well,<br/>the UFO has a force field which prevents it from showing up<br/>on radar,&quot; the ufologist replies, thus rendering his prediction<br/>of a UFO landing unfalsifiable (viz., no human technology<br/>can detect it). In the case of the &quot;crisis theory&quot; cult of modern<br/>music,<br/>the attempt to make unfasifiable the prediction that &quot;Tonality has<br/>ended!&quot;<br/>typically runs along the lines of &quot;Oh, well, tonality actually HAS<br/>ended,<br/>it&apos;s just that our backward-looking stodgy audiences don&apos;t<br/>realize it and won&apos;t accept it.&quot; (Once again, the event allegedly<br/>occurred, but no one can detect that it occurred.)<br/>   Other dodges used in a futile effort to to salvage the failed<br/>doomsday predictions<br/>made by the &quot;crisis theory&quot; cult of modern music include the ad hoc<br/>objection -- also known as decoupling cause and effect. In<br/>ufology, this scam typically pops up when the ufologist encounters<br/>proof that no one saw a UFO abudcting anyone on the predicted<br/>night. &quot;Oh, well, aliens _did_ abduct someone -- they just didn&apos;t<br/>do it with a UFO.&quot;  In the &quot;crisis theory&quot; doomsday cult of modern<br/>music,<br/>this ad hoc objection (AKA decoupling of cause and effect)<br/>takes the form of the specious claim, &quot;Oh, well, all modern<br/>composers actually DO use atonal serial methods of composition,<br/>they just call them by different names like &grave;algorithmic<br/>composition&apos; and &grave;computer music.&apos;&quot; (In other words, cause and<br/>effect are decoupled by redefining whatever *actually* happened<br/>as the alleged result of the cause which failed to produce what<br/>the cult leader predicted it would produce.)<br/>   Other dodges used in a futile attempt to salvage the failed<br/>doomsday<br/>predictions of the &quot;crisis theory&quot; of modern music involve<br/>the familiar &quot;post hoc propter hoc&quot; fallacy (i.e., if a dog barks<br/>during a thunderstorm, the dog&apos;s barking caused the thunderstorm).<br/>In ufology this logical fallacy takes the form &quot;UFO abductions<br/>must be real, since so many people report them,&quot; while in<br/>the &quot;crisis theory&quot; cult of modern music this logical fallacy<br/>appears in the guise of &quot;The end of tonality must be real,<br/>since so many music professors and so many modern composers<br/>produce atonal music.&quot; (the logical fallacy arises from the failure<br/>to recognize that the thunderstorm might cause the dog&apos;s barking<br/>rather than the other way round -- likewise, the possibilty that music<br/>professors composing lotsa atonal music might cause the profs to claim<br/>that tonality has ended, rather than the other way round.. &quot;Post<br/>hoc propter hoc.&quot;  Correlation is not causation, as any grade<br/>school logic textbook informs us.)<br/>   Further scams and junkthink con jobs which prop up the<br/>failed predictions of the &quot;crisis theory&quot; of modern music include<br/>the false antinomy (&quot;We must either have a police state or<br/>total anarchy!&quot; No, there exists a large middle ground between<br/>the two wild extremes) -- in so-called &quot;modern&quot; music this<br/>takes the form of &quot;We must either have [fill in the blank<br/>according to the decade -- serial rows, pitch class set theory,<br/>IRCAM pseudosciece] or trivial Muzak kitsch!&quot;  Also popular<br/>is the self-fulfilling historicist prediction a la Georg F. Hegel and<br/>Karl Marx and the American social Darwinists of the early 1900s,<br/>to wit, &quot;We are approaching an historically inevitable inflexion<br/>point in human evolution in which UFOs will land and take<br/>us all away to the stars, and the proof is the ever-growing<br/>number of UFO cult members!&quot;  In the &quot;crisis theory&quot; doomsday<br/>cult of modern music, this delusion takes the form of &quot;We<br/>are approaching an historically inevitable inflexion point<br/>in musical evolution in which total pitch-class set atonality<br/>will encompass all music everywhere on earth, and the<br/>proof is the ever-growing number of music professors<br/>and college music students who use pitch-class set<br/>atonal music theory!&quot;  (The logical fallacy here derives from<br/>the failure to realize that if the process is historically<br/>necessary, there is no need for anyone to work to<br/>produce the desired end -- but the argument depends<br/>precisely on the fact that so many cultists are frantically<br/>working to produce the claimed effect. Occam&apos;s Razor<br/>assures us that the simpler explanation is that we are<br/>dealing with a cult whose only supporting evidence for its<br/>predictions is the frenzied activity of the cult members.)<br/>   ---<br/>   In short, we can see from even this brief overview<br/>that Miller Puckette&apos;s &quot;crisis theory&quot; of modern<br/>music is an apocalyptic cult fantasy which, like all<br/>doomsday cult belief systems, fails to conform with<br/>reality.<br/>   Consequently most of the alleged &quot;problems&quot; Puckette<br/>describes boil down to gyrations and convulsions and intellectual<br/>flip-flops and mental spasms resulting from failed attempts to<br/>get the apocalyptic cult belief system to conform with<br/>reality.  The alleged &quot;problems&quot; largely disappear if<br/>we abandon the failed apocalyptic musical belief system.<br/>    For example, an objective historical survey of<br/>20th century music fails to reveal signs of any alleged<br/>&quot;crisis.&quot;  While the Viennese kook whipped himself into<br/>convulsions in an effort to solve a purported &quot;crisis&quot;<br/>in modern music which does not appear to exist,<br/>other composers who lived around the same time<br/>merrily wrote bushels of  excellent music sans<br/>convulsions..seemingly unaware of any alleged<br/>&quot;crisis.&quot;<br/>   Such composers living &amp; working around the time of<br/>the Viennese kook include Ralph Vaughan Williams,<br/>today one of the most popular of 20th century<br/>composers. Williams did not need to indulge in<br/>theoretical or ideological spasms in order to<br/>produce &quot;Variations On A Theme Of Thomas<br/>Tallis&quot; in 1907 (compare with the Viennese kook&apos;s<br/>&quot;Five Orchestral Pieces&quot; in 1905).  &quot;Tallis&quot; is<br/>widely beloved by modern audiences and is<br/>frequently programmed in the modern<br/>symphonic repertoire. By contrast, the Viennese<br/>kook&apos;s musical output almost never appears<br/>in 21st century symphonic programs, and is still<br/>widely despised by modern audiences (despite<br/>failed doomsday cult predictions that subsequent<br/>generations would embrace the music of the<br/>Viennese kook with fervent adoration. Compare<br/>with cult predictions that &quot;the cult guru will return<br/>to life,&quot; viz., hollow earth cult leader Cyrus Teed,<br/>whose corpse had to be confiscated by Florida<br/>cops as a health hazard circa 1930 because Teed&apos;s<br/>cult followers expected him to return from death.<br/>See &quot;Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science&quot;<br/>1956, by Martin Gardner for more on the Teed hollow<br/>Earth cult, also &quot;Kooks&quot; by Donna Kossey,<br/>Feral Press, 1995. Then compare the cult<br/>followers&apos; behavior with that of the followers<br/>of the End of Tonality cult established by the<br/>Viennese kook.)<br/>   From an objective standpoint, the only difference<br/>would appear to be that Vaughan Williams had<br/>musical talent, while the Viennese kook did not.<br/>(To give him credit, the Viennese kook _did_ manage<br/>to come up with an unusually inventive scam for<br/>covering up his lack of musical talent. Like the<br/>accomplishment of Maurizio Ponzi, that _was_ an<br/>achievement...in a manner of speaking.)<br/>   Other talented composers who led long and productive<br/>lives without the need for ideological convulsions<br/>induced by apocalyptic historicist fantasies<br/>include Janacek, Prokofiev, Hindemith, Bartok,<br/>Ravel, and Stravinsky. None of these composers<br/>appears to have predicted the imminent &quot;end of&quot;<br/>anything (either tonality, or anything else). They<br/>simply composed a lot of very good music<br/>sans ideological spasms.<br/>   Looking at the period from 1950 to 1999,<br/>we note a veritable explosion of superb modern<br/>composers including Iannis Xenakis, Krysztof<br/>Pendercki, Conlon Nacarrow, Jean-Claude<br/>Risset, John Chowning, William Schottstaedt,<br/>Paul Lansky, Larry Polansky, and many many<br/>others. None of these composers appears to<br/>have felt the need to indulge in an apocalyptic<br/>musical belief system.  Once again, they merely<br/>composed lots of superb music, sans ideological<br/>paroxysms.<br/>   From this viewpoint, we find ourselves in a position<br/>to ask a simple question. To wit: did any kind of<br/>alleged &quot;crisis&quot; actually occur in 20th century<br/>music?  Or did we simply witness a handful of<br/>kooks who wound themselves into ideological<br/>knots, and whose music (along with their failed<br/>apocalyptic musical predictions) has fallen by<br/>the wayside, as typically happens with the<br/>ideological output of apocalyptic cults?<br/>   --<br/>   From this perspective, we may regard either with<br/>serene amusement or quiet disdain such proclamations<br/>by Miller Puckette as &quot;Stand back: twentieth century<br/>art music is falling under its own weight.&quot;  This typical<br/>doomsday prediction depends on the redefinition<br/>of the words &quot;twentieth century art music&quot; to mean<br/>&quot;music produced by followers of apocalyptic musical<br/>cults of the 20th century.&quot; Apparently none of the many<br/>serious composers who produce music outside the<br/>university are composers, and apparently their music<br/>is not music. Such are the miracles of Newspeak, as<br/>George Orwell called it (a form of invented jargon whose<br/>words often have a meaning the reverse of their normal<br/>sense in ordinary English. In Newspeak, for instance,<br/>&quot;free thought&quot; is redefined as &quot;thoughtcrime.&quot;)<br/>   Once we understand that Miller Puckette is speaking<br/>a form of invented jargon in which customary English-<br/>language words have been redefined according to a<br/>doomsday cult&apos;s lexicon, we can easily decrypt<br/>Puckette&apos;s writings by building a simple glossary. The<br/>KKK called such a glossary &quot;The Kloran.&quot; The Kloran<br/>told KKK members how to speak and how to use<br/>the jargon of their cult. (Apparently there was a children&apos;s<br/>Kloran, a women&apos;s Kloran, and a men&apos;s Kloran. There also<br/>apparently exists a KKK songbook!) Once we construct a simple<br/>musical Kloran, we will find ourselves in a postiion<br/>to clearly understand Miller Puckette&apos;s jargon.<br/>   This leads us to a straightforward translation<br/>of Puckette&apos;s article:</p><p>   GLOSSARY:</p><p>   &quot;Twentieth century art music&quot;

 -- all those who do not belong<br/>   to the apocalyptic musical doomsday cult are not musicians,<br/>   they are not composers, they are even human, and in fact<br/>   they are both enemies of history and traitors to all mankind (this<br/>   is quite familiar from the Stalinist show trials of the 1930s, the<br/>   Pol Pot interrogations in Cambodia in the 1970s, the Taliban<br/>   executions of the 1990s, etc.)</p><p> &quot;the rules are an essential kind of mental chewing gum, without<br/>which the<br/>  composer can not walk&quot;

Because he uses computers and does not<br/>produce a standard musical score (as required by the dead European<br/>doomsday cult gurus), Puckette finds himself on the outer fringe of<br/>the modernist musical doomsday cult -- and he would evidently<br/>prefer to be the Grand Dragon, or at the very least an Imperial<br/>Wizard.<br/>   In order to remove himself from the outer fringe of the modernist<br/>musical doosmday cult to a position nearer its central burning cross,<br/>Puckette finds it necessary to redefine some of the terms of the<br/>modernist<br/>musical Kloran. Most of these redefinitions follow the pattern of the<br/>usual<br/>KKK power struggles -- namely, arguments over the amounts of<br/>cash coming into the Klan (never enough) and the recruitment of new<br/>Klan members (we need a better quality of cross-burner in our<br/>organization, these yohos are too stupid).<br/>   In the 1980s David Duke won such a KKK power struggle by<br/>recasting the Ku Klux Klan as a neo-conservative organization<br/>to appeal to younger voters disaffected with liberal tax-and-spend<br/>policies. David Duke invented code phrases like &quot;we oppose racial<br/>quotas&quot; (which roughly translated means &quot;kill all the niggers on the<br/>Great Day of the Rope&quot;), thus changing the details of the Kloran<br/>while preserving its overall goals and ideology.<br/>   Miller Puckette appears to be proposing to add some new<br/>terminology to the modernist musical Kloran in the time-honored<br/>manner of David Duke. Thus he proposes such novel terminology<br/>as &quot;more relevant to the situation&quot; -- almost exactly the same<br/>language employed by David Duke in his Ku Klux Klan power<br/>grab.  In this case, Miller Puckette&apos;s phrase appears to mean<br/>something like &quot;new ways to yank money out of parents&apos; wallets<br/>for the privilege of enrolling their children in a musical doomsday<br/>cult.&quot;  Presumably this results from the growing use of credit<br/>cards for college tuitiion, inasmuch as credit card charges can<br/>be inconveniently cancelled in the event of fraud. (Parents have<br/>also begun to file lawsuits against colleges for breach of promise,<br/>creating similar threats to the cult&apos;s survival. It is interesting to<br/>note that family members of  KKK lynching victims have recently begun<br/>using a similar strategy of targeted lawsuits to impoverish KKK<br/>chapters across the United States.)<br/>   Such stock code phrases as &quot;an irresistably corrupting influence<br/>on our music&quot; echo David Duke&apos;s code words about the<br/>&quot;collapse of traditional values.&quot;  In both cases this seems<br/>to mean &quot;keeping the uppity niggers in their place.&quot;<br/>In Miller Puckette&apos;s case, the uppity musical niggers would<br/>appear to be the 270-plus million Americans who pay 51<br/>billion dollars in annual taxes to support American state universities<br/>(through direct grants) and all private American universities<br/>(indirectly,<br/>through tax breaks on the investment profits from their 15-billion-<br/>dollar<br/>and 20-billion-dollar and 30-billion-dollar Harvard and Yale and<br/>Princeton endowments).<br/>----------<br/>--mclaren</p></div>
