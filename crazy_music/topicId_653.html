Somehow I think we&apos;d mutually<br/>&gt; agree that this music is very beautiful to the ear, yet defies much<br/>&gt; of what mathematics might have to say about it. Imagine if the<br/>&gt; tunings of the Gamelan were constructed in the laboratory of the<br/>&gt; microtonal theorist. Do we think they would find them worthy to go<br/>&gt; one set forward and commit to actually creating an ensemble of bronze<br/>&gt; instruments in these tunings or would the microtonal theorist discard<br/>&gt; the shimmering quality and beating of the new found tunings, because<br/>&gt; they didn&apos;t &quot;look good&quot; on the lattice? Don&apos;t think they are thinking<br/>&gt; in this manner in Bali!  ;  )</p><p>As someone whose main tuning used over the last few years is one version<br/>of Erv Wilson&apos;s Meta Slendro. A tuning method he will disclose in el<br/>paso, which can beat more than anything you can imagine. (you can see<br/>the review from the Microfest in the times in this regard). On top of<br/>this i have now 3 vibraphones in this tuning, a set of Meru bass bars, a<br/>pump organ, two small marimbas,  two kotos and a hammer dulcimer. I am<br/>doing just what you are describing but not in Bronze.<br/>    So you can see that in the proper hands, one can use math and not<br/>apply some arbitrary JI or ET somewhere it doesn&apos;t belong. It seems just<br/>as feasible that one could misuse any approach including a non one.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even though I have did some experimentation/recording with matching<br/>&gt; tuning to timbre, and have had some interesting results with this,<br/>&gt; some of my reservations about this echo back to what I said in the<br/>&gt; beginning of this thread, about timbre [acoustic especially, and the<br/>&gt; better sounding electronic timbres] not being static, but<br/>&gt; continuously variable. Each moment it is the same - but different.<br/>&gt; Using FFT to analyze sound samples of Gongs being stroked in various<br/>&gt; places and velocities has revealed to me that depending upon where<br/>&gt; and how hard the gong is stricken, it will bring out totally new<br/>&gt; partials, while some are found in all samples. A great example of<br/>&gt; something that is almost living in you hands as you play it. Same<br/>&gt; thing with my frame drums. A tak and a dum under from the same drum<br/>&gt; under FFT will reveal very different partial structures, while some<br/>&gt; common partials remain. I think many timbres are this way -<br/>&gt; especially the inharmonic ones, so the point is that I feel at best<br/>&gt; all we can hope for is to find some best mean when we think of<br/>&gt; matching tuning to timbre. Perhaps when it is achieved with<br/>&gt; resynthesis, then a match for all timbres can be found - but I think<br/>&gt; generally speaking it is a very complex undertaking to think of ways<br/>&gt; to bring ensembles of timbres into a similar spectrum tuning, where<br/>&gt; resynthesis is not being used. So in a major way, I think what you<br/>&gt; have said in the past about the importance of tuning by the perceived<br/>&gt; fundamentals must be a good rule of thumb for making many kinds of<br/>&gt; timbres work with a given tuning - this has also been my experience<br/>&gt; too, because I know that the music sound good when I play inharmonic<br/>&gt; timbres on stretched or compressed tunings, and in this instance, the<br/>&gt; tuning is not matched to the timbre spectrum. All this is hugely<br/>&gt; interesting stuff to me - just how both of these things seem to be<br/>&gt; valid possibilities. Certainly Bill has did some incredible music<br/>&gt; with this, which I&apos;m in total admiration and awe of.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Rebab is cool!</p><p>I have constantly drawn back to Gagaku which has it&apos;s origin in<br/>Afghanistan, of which the civilization from which it came is gone<br/>without a trace. This is according to Chinese and Japanese sources.<br/>(This area is also where all ceremonial magic has been traced by<br/>anthropologist BTW)<br/>    Anyway here we have more than one tuning going on. Pythagorean in<br/>the strings. With each of the wind groups having their own particular<br/>intonational approaches. Notice how the flutes move almost is a very<br/>tight little clusters.<br/>Subharmonics like scales on the oboe. Basically we have parallel tunings<br/>having a similar structure. To do such a thing today or in the future is<br/>going to require much more work on all our part!

His work<br/>hasn&apos;t been rigorously peer-reviewed, and even if it had, such a<br/>result does not (nor does Bill claim that it does) amount to a<br/>proof that gamelan tunings are chosen to minimize beating.
