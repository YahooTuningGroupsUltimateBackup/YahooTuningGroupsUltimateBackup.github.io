It&apos;s clear that disrupting brain chemistry or<br/>structure changes<br/>consciousness in some way, but not how normal consciousness arises from brain<br/>chemistry and structure.</p><p>&gt;I don&apos;t think timescale is critical again if you are thinking about<br/>&gt;implicate order and vertical information, but that is off the top of<br/>&gt;my head.</p><p>Bohm&apos;s implicate order interpretation of QM makes exactly the same<br/>quantitative predictions<br/>as the conventional Copenhagen one, but, IIRC, it still has unobservable<br/>quantities or<br/>entities. Because of this, most QM&apos;s don&apos;t find it very useful.</p><p>Tegmark&apos;s point is that any quantum superpositions are far too<br/>evanescent to have any<br/>influence on the behavior of neurons, which are classical, or<br/>perception. However, he<br/>thinks that ensembles of neurons, if I understand him, may have a<br/>collective<br/>behavior he calls &quot;hyperclassical.&quot; This is another form of<br/>unpredictability, though classical in origin.</p><p>&gt;Since we are moving to Tucson I plan on attending the Tucson<br/>&gt;Conference in Consciousness next year</p><p>Tuscon is quite near both El Paso, TX and Pomona,CA. Hope you can<br/>attend either or both microtonal conferences (El Paso in Nov 2001),<br/>Pomona-Claremont in 2002).</p><p>&gt; I think harmonic studies using microtubular  preparations might be fascinating,<br/>&gt;somewhat akin to the sound plate studies that have been done.</p><p>Are you refering to Hans Jenny&apos;s work here?  A former student, Whilst<br/>Phew, lent me<br/>his book a couple of years ago. Chladni figures?</p><p>--John</p><p>--John</p></div>
