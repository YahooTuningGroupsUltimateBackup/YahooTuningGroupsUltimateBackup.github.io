Academic music, or just academic<br/>&gt; &gt; music at UCSD (where I believe Puckette is based)?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;ll post the link to the whole article later -- he<br/>&gt; speaks on behalf of american academic/university music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; unlistenable music. To compare our music to that of<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; north India by asking which is the more complex is<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; simply ludicrous.&quot; -- Miller Puckette<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Who asks this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s a rhetorical device -- he means to say that it is<br/>&gt; self-evident that North Indian music is more complex<br/>&gt; than American academic music.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; He brings this up in the context that an apparent goal<br/>&gt; of academic music is ever increasing level of<br/>&gt; complexity &amp; that the complexity pursued is of an<br/>&gt; structural and theoretical nature, rather than musical.<br/>&gt; He points out that North Indian music is more complex<br/>&gt; and yet is still musical and listenable, whereas<br/>&gt; American academic music is unmusical and unlistenable,<br/>&gt; as is evidenced by the lack of interest of audiences<br/>&gt; for western music outside of those who have been<br/>&gt; conditioned through the grist mill of academia. This<br/>&gt; contrasts with the far more sophisticated and complex<br/>&gt; North Indian music which finds wide and appreciative<br/>&gt; audiences.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; awarded Ph.D. degrees, although art historians or<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; theorists are; their output is not works of art but<br/>&gt; &gt;&gt; scholarly prose.&quot; --  Miller Puckette, 1999<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm . . . .
