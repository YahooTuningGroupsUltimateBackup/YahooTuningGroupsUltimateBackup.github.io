Moreover, Joe Monzo must provide at least<br/>&gt; 3 scientific results for each one I have cited, since<br/>&gt; the rule of thumb is that once reproducible experiments<br/>&gt; have been published, it takes a *whole* lot of contrary<br/>&gt; scientific evidence to discredit &apos;em.<br/>&gt;     Likewise, Joe Monzo must provide countering citations<br/>&gt; from music history and philosophy to disprove my citations<br/>&gt; showing the intellectual bankruptcy of Schoenberg&apos;s ideas.</p><p>I &quot;must&quot;, just because Brian says I &quot;must&quot;?  Not.</p><p>Sorry, not interested in attempting to disprove your citations<br/>from the scientific literature which show that Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>theory is invalid.  Much more interested in acheiving a proper<br/>understanding of my cult hero&apos;s &quot;incoherent writings&quot;, and in<br/>the analytically and compositionally useful ideas which I get<br/>out of that endeavor, which are many.</p><p>&gt;     Until Joe Monzo resopnds in this fashion with hard<br/>&gt; evidence, instead of meaningless quotes from the sacred<br/>&gt; texts of his cult guru, I will not respond except with<br/>&gt; a copy of this post.</p><p>Gee, now *that&apos;s* not a waste of other people&apos;s bandwidth.</p><p>&gt;     PREDICTION: Like a creationist unable to resopnd<br/>&gt; to criticisms of his cult beliefs except by quotes<br/>&gt; from the Bible, Joe Monzo will never respond to<br/>&gt; the direct evidence I have cited against Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; claims except with more citations from Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; own writings.</p><p>Well, that&apos;s a pretty easy prediction to make, since I&apos;ve<br/>already stated such plainly.</p><p>&gt;     Sadly, that by Joe Monzo response is meaningless -- for you<br/>&gt; cannot prove or disprove a belief system solely<br/>&gt; from inside that belief system. You must always<br/>&gt; test any belief system with evidence from *outside*<br/>&gt; the belief system.</p><p>If other people did not understand or had misconceptions<br/>about Schoenberg&apos;s theory, especially if it was because<br/>of *mclaren&apos;s* obfuscations of it and errors in describing<br/>it, then happily, my posts are not meaningless.</p><p>Fortunately, as I keep stating and mclaren keeps ignoring,<br/>I am not trying to prove anything, except that Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>harmonic theory is a rich field worthy of much study.</p><p>&gt;     Joe Monzo&apos;s persistent refusal to do this marks<br/>&gt; him as a kook and a member of a fanatical musical<br/>&gt; cult.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>My own opinion is that my &quot;persistent refusal to do this&quot;<br/>marks me as a composer and music-theorist and not as a<br/>scientist, which is a situation I&apos;ll happily accept.</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
