Of course, real composers in the real world recognize<br/>&gt; that all of these tunings are simply heard as &quot;a whole buncha<br/>&gt; small intervals&quot; by listeners and practicing composers alike.<br/>&gt; Once you get past about 29 equal, hands-on experience composing<br/>&gt; in these equal temperaments shows that there&apos;s no significant<br/>&gt; audible musical difference between (say) 51 as opposed to 55 or<br/>&gt; 53, or 60 as opposed to 65.</p><p>Actually, I&apos;m not sure about this part of what you say.</p><p>I find when I improvise in a temperament the improvisation seems<br/>to be much influenced by the temperament, even if difference<br/>in the tuning itself may be subtle to hear, somehow not enough<br/>to explain the difference.</p><p>So one could perhaps use improvisation itself as a way to pick up<br/>on the nuances of the temperament. Or if using an acoustic rather<br/>than keyboard istrument, try playing along with a tuning while<br/>improvising, and see if the way one plays is affected by the<br/>temperament.</p><p>Retuning an already improvised piece in various ways and trying<br/>to pick up on the tunign in that way may not work so well, particularly<br/>if one tries hard to listen to it (and so engage the analytical<br/>mind strongly) to try to hear what it is. For one thing,<br/>the piece already will have some of the inspriation of the<br/>tuning it was comosed in, some kind of expectation of how<br/>chord progressions work, so one may hear notes as just slightly<br/>retuned from that and not notice that, rather than in the<br/>new tuning. Then also, one is talking about something fairly<br/>subtle, (but possibly strong in its effect too, just subtle<br/>in the sense that we aren&apos;t used to picking up on it).</p><p>We are brought up in our musical culture that doesn&apos;t have a<br/>particularly live tradition of sensitivity to temperaments,<br/>so perhaps this is something that the analytical mind will<br/>easily miss out on.</p><p>It&apos;s a thought anyway.</p><p>Here is what I&apos;m planning to say about 55-tet (after comment from Paul<br/>on MMM, and mentioning a web site I found in a search of the<br/>tuning list archive)</p><p>&quot;<br/>55-tet twelve tone scale is a close approximation to sixth comma<br/>meantone. Origins seem to be from Tosi in 1723. Each step of<br/>55-tet is very close to a syntonic comma. This makes a twelve tone<br/>scale consisiting of two sizes of semitone, one of five, and one<br/>of four approximate syntonic commas. Leopold Mozart (Wolfgang Mozart&apos;s<br/>father) was in favour of this system and wrote a couple of scales to be used<br/>as excerices for it. Teleman advocated it for this same reason.</p><p>Here is a site by an author who strongly advocates use of sixth<br/>comma meantone for baroque music:</p><p><a href="http://www-midischool.cwru.edu/Duffin/Vallotti/56K/page4.html">http://www-midischool.cwru.edu/Duffin/Vallotti/56K/page4.html</a></p><p>On page 4 he mentions that the tritone sounds particularly good<br/>in sixth comma meantone, being at the most optimal position in<br/>a certain sense, and this links in with the improvisations -</p><p>I remember noticing that the one from B to F sounded particularly<br/>nice and enjoyed using it.<br/>&quot;</p><p>(N.b. accidentally posted this to MMM first - sorry).</p><p>Robert</p></div>
