Jacky, I guess I forget that you are not so far<br/>from the beach there. I had no idea you were so<br/>knowledgable in this field. Imagine my surprise to<br/>check my email and find such comprehensive and<br/>useful data right there waiting for me.</p><p>I&apos;m going to try to integrate what you told me and make<br/>up some test inputs for a model I am working on and see<br/>what I can come up with.</p><p>Thanks! This is a great group!</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
