If I had the means<br/>to do so, I&apos;d use something better.  For now, I&apos;m stuck with GM and<br/>all its flaws.</p><p>[mclaren:]<br/>&gt;it&apos;s time for me to reveal that yet another member of this discussion<br/>&gt;group (who shan&apos;t be named) has also voiced hi/r disgust with 5-limit<br/>&gt;adaptive retuning.</p><p>Yes, some don&apos;t like it, and that&apos;s absolutely fine with me.  I&apos;m not<br/>out to take over the world, only explore some options.  Negative<br/>feedback is actually more valuable than positive, as it often suggests<br/>refinements I might make.</p><p>&gt;Since these psychoacoustic experiments were performed way back in 1986,<br/>&gt;it stands to reason that the JI moonies have never heard of them.  An<br/>&gt;old story. The JI moonies espouse a set of 2500-year-old musical fairy<br/>&gt;tales, so no one should find it surprising that they&apos;ve never heard of<br/>&gt;listening experiments conducted 15 years ago.</p><p>I will freely admit that I&apos;m shockingly ignorant.  I worked with<br/>adaptive tuning in a complete vacuum for years, and am still playing<br/>catch-up.  But the Mathews/Pierce/Roberts study would seem to suggest<br/>that some of us are &quot;JI moonies&quot; by nature, no?</p><p>&gt;With 4 members of this discussion group now speaking out against<br/>&gt;deLaubenfels&apos; procedure...</p><p>Oh, I&apos;m sure there are more than four who don&apos;t like it.  I _do_ want<br/>to get as clear a picture as possible of the like/dislike ratio, but<br/>I&apos;m content, ultimately, with pleasing only myself.  To have<br/>experienced, as I have, that some others are also delighted, is a<br/>wonderful bonus.</p><p>I accept your challenge for a &quot;double-blind&quot; listening test.  Shall I<br/>pick the piece?  Robert Walker&apos;s sequence of a C.P.E. Bach flute<br/>(recorder?) sonata might be nice.  Or a piano work by Mozart.  Do you<br/>have any preference?</p><p>(Just to pick a minor quibble: this will actually be a &quot;single-blind&quot;<br/>test, will it not, since I will know which is which...)</p><p>&gt;Is there any musical utility for adaptive retuning?</p><p>&gt;That probably depends on what the adaptive retuning is retuning to, and<br/>&gt;retuning from. For example, there&apos;s no reason I can see why John<br/>&gt;deLaubenfels has to restrict his adaptive retuning algorithm to 5- or<br/>&gt;7-limit JI. What would happen if deLaubenfels tried, say, 31-limit JI,<br/>&gt;or 43-limit JI, or 17-limit JI, or 23-limit JI?</p><p>I agree, but there&apos;s a problem, one I have not been able to overcome so<br/>far: when the input is 12-tET, serious ambiguities arise even for<br/>7-limit, and become crippling at 13-limit and above.  Perhaps there&apos;s<br/>a way around this that I haven&apos;t thought of, so suggestions are welcome.</p><p>&gt;Other issues involve the possibility of adaptively retuning 12-equal<br/>&gt;(or other non-12 ETs!) into some other non-12 tuning.  This might offer<br/>&gt;real musical possibilties. In a Proceedings of a 1911 musicological<br/>&gt;congress I obtained recently on interlibrary loan, Melchior Sachs used<br/>&gt;a 19-equal harmonium to play 19-tone versions of Bach and Chopin<br/>&gt;compositions back in 1911.</p><p>&gt;John deLaubenfels&apos; general procedure might offer some very real musical<br/>&gt;possibilities if John would expand the retuning capabilities to go from<br/>&gt;any ET to any other ET, and from any JI limit to any other JI limit.</p><p>All excellent ideas.  Just a question of finding the time to program<br/>them.</p><p>&gt;The idea of trying to get all the major and minor triads beatless and<br/>&gt;5-limit was tried back in the 19th century.</p><p>Yes, but without the tools available today to distribute out commas,<br/>etc.  Let&apos;s begin anew and see what falls out.</p><p>Please let me know if you have any thoughts on a piece for the blind<br/>challenge, and I&apos;ll try to get it posted this weekend.  Natch, it has<br/>to be something that I can get ahold of an actual GM sequence of, and<br/>that I agree is appropriate (i.e., no serial pieces ;-&gt; ).</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=619 href="#619">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/20/2001 3:44:35 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>brilliant!</p><p>&quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt;  But the Mathews/Pierce/Roberts study would seem to suggest<br/>&gt; that some of us are &quot;JI moonies&quot; by nature, no?<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
