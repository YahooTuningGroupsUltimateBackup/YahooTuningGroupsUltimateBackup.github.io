Bear in mind that Dante Rosati has told<br/>the lie that the superb microtonal composer Jacky Ligon is a &quot;slow<br/>brain&quot; because Jacky refuses to parrot the provably false<br/>superstitions gibbered on the ATL -- provably false superstitions like<br/>&quot;small integer ratios produce acoustically smooth musical intervals,<br/>while large integer ratios produce acoustically rough musical<br/>intervals.&quot;<br/>Jacky knows that such foolish acoustic superstitions are provably<br/>false. Therefore Dante Rosati had to lie about Jacky Ligon and smear<br/>Jacky Ligon and assassinate Jacky Ligon&apos;s character and throw shit at<br/>Jacky Ligon until some of it sticks.<br/>Not content with telling one lie, Dante Rosati has heaped more ordure<br/>on his own reputation by describing me as &quot;mentally deranged.&quot;<br/>Okay, Dante Rosati, here&apos;s your chance to prove you&apos;re not a liar.<br/>All you have to do is produce 3 (three) notarized copies of different<br/>IQ tests to prove that Jacky Ligon is mentally retarded. A sub-70 IQ<br/>score should do.<br/>Produce the evidence in hard numbers from Spearman&apos;s g, Dante Rosati,<br/>or stand revealed as a liar and a character assassin.<br/>Next, Dante Rosati, all you need to is provide us with notarized<br/>copies of at least 1 (one) report by a psychiatrist certifying that I<br/>suffer from mental illness, and at least one (1) notarized copy of a<br/>court proceeding declaring me mentally incompetent by reason of mental<br/>illness.<br/>If you speak the truth, Dante Rosati, you should have no problem<br/>finding such documents.<br/>Come on, Dante Rosati. Provide us with the proof of your statements or<br/>stand revealed as a liar and a character assassin.<br/>Jacky Ligon is one of the nicest guys in the world and one hell of a<br/>microtonal composer, but even he described Dante Rosati as &quot;a liar&quot;<br/>and &quot;an asshole.&quot;  Dante Rosati typifies the kind of people who infest<br/>the Alternative Lying List -- people with no facts, no evidence, no<br/>logic, just hysterical name-calling.<br/>Naturally, Dante Rosati has produced nothing worth mentioning in<br/>microtonality -- no scholarship of any significance, no music of any<br/>significance (his one CD is genuinely pathetic), no mathematical music<br/>theory of any significance... Nothing but crazed lies and hysterical<br/>name-calling.<br/>Of course, Dante Rosati (who has told lie after lie in public) is not<br/>the only example of such pathology from the ATL.  We now have the<br/>Three Stooges of microtonality -- Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot;<br/>Smith and Jonathan &quot;Can&apos;t Stop Lying&quot; Szanto, and Dante &quot;Call Everyone<br/>Names Until They Stop Annoying Me With the Facts&quot; Rosati.

From this point on,  Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed<br/>Numerology&quot; Smith can only hope to be known (when someone googles him)<br/>as &quot;that character assassin who told all those crazed lies online.&quot;<br/>From now on,  Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith&apos;s only claim to<br/>notoriety is as a person who indulges in hysterical name-calling to<br/>cover up his lack of facts and lack of logic and lack of rational<br/>arguments.</p><p>It is accordingly unnecessary to respond further to Gene<br/>&quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith&apos;s latest post.  All that remains to<br/>be said is -- shame on you, Mark Nowitsky. For shame! Making a proven<br/>liar and character assassin like Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed Numerology&quot; Smith<br/>a moderator on the ATL was a shameful act. Shame on you, Mark<br/>Nowitsky. You should be ashamed of yourself. For shame. For shame!</p><p>&quot;&grave;What It Takes To Be a Leader&apos; was one of the first issues [General<br/>H. Norman] Schwarzkopf addressed.

Shame on Mark Nowitsky for picking someone with such moral<br/>character as Gene Smith to be a moderator.

I can prove with hard facts, by your<br/>own words, that you have lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and<br/>lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and lied<br/>online.<br/>Jonathan Szanto has lied and lied and lied and lied and lied. Among<br/>other lies, Szanto has accused the entire membership of the<br/>Alternative Lying List of being &quot;cognitively challenged.&quot; Then when I<br/>met him at the 2001 MicroFest, Jonathan Szanto lied some more about<br/>having told those lies. &quot;I never said that,&quot; Szanto yelped. &quot;I never<br/>said any of that!&quot;<br/>Then Szanto lied about having claimed he never told lies.<br/>Jonathan Szanto tells lies online. Jonathan Szanto tells lies in<br/>person. Jonathan Szanto lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and<br/>lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies<br/>and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies and lies.<br/>If anything but lies come out of Jonathan Szanto&apos;s mouth, I haven&apos;t<br/>heard about it.<br/>Mind you, I don&apos;t say it&apos;s _impossible_ that Jonathan Szanto has told<br/>the truth at some time. I&apos;ve just never been there when it happened.<br/>The basic principle motivating Jonathan Szanto appears to be the need<br/>to degrade and brutalize and humiliate anyone who dares compose<br/>microtonal music. To this end, Szanto seems willing to tell any lie,<br/>no matter how absurd...to cover himself with ordure, no matter how<br/>vile, as long as his victim gets slimed too.<br/>Jonathan Szanto qualifies as the Roy Cohn of microtonality -- a hated<br/>figure despised by the victims of his lies, infamous for his attacks<br/>on others on the ATL...attacks disguised as mealy-mouthed &quot;concern&quot;<br/>for his victims.<br/>Like a rapist who sternly lectures his virgin victim about her moral<br/>laxity in having sex before raping her, Jonathan Szanto pretends to<br/>concern about the victims of his verbal muggings even while telling<br/>the most ludicrous lies imaginable.<br/>Jonathan Szanto composes no microtonal music and performs no<br/>microtonal music. As someone who whose proven and documented<br/>dishonesty can only be described as &quot;pathological,&quot; and as a person<br/>who composes no microtonal music and has released no CDs of microtonal<br/>music and gives no concerts of microtonal music, Szanto has no<br/>qualifications for discussing microtonality.<br/>Szanto&apos;s whole goal in life appears to be to tear down everyone else<br/>to fit his secret image of himself. Motivated in equal parts by<br/>apparent hate and envy, Szanto proves unable to release any CDs of<br/>microtonal music and has performed no microtonal music since 1987.<br/>You tell me. Is this a microtonalist?<br/>Or a pathological liar obsessively compelled to rip and tear at his<br/>betters like a paraiah dog dying of rabies who tries to rip the throat<br/>out of every healthy person he comes across?<br/>If Jonathan Szanto has composed so much microtonal music, let us hear<br/>it. Show us the great big stack of CDs he&apos;s produced full of<br/>microtonal music. Come on, Szanto. Let us see &apos;em.<br/>Szanto has produced nothing because all he can do is lie and lie and<br/>lie and lie and lie about microtonalists who DO produce microtonal<br/>music.<br/>If you&apos;ve performed so much microtonal music over the last 15 years,<br/>Szanto, let us see it. Show us the great big stack of CDs of<br/>microtonal music you&apos;ve performed.<br/>Come on, Szanto. Let us see &apos;em.<br/>Szanto has performed no microtonal music over the last 15 years<br/>because all he can do is lie and lie and lie and lie and lie about<br/>microtonal performers who DO perform microtonal music.<br/>Szanto is the poster boy for everything that has gone so horribly,<br/>terribly, monstrously wrong with the ATL.<br/>Jonathan Szanto has released no CDs of microtonal music that he has<br/>composed.<br/>Jonathan Szanto has performed no microtonal music since 1987.<br/>When he encounters a microtonal composer, Jonathan Szanto does nothing<br/>but ridicule and denigrate and ruthlessly rip and tear, clawing with<br/>savage pathological dishonesty, until he verbally flays and<br/>disembowels anyone who *does* compose or perform microtonal music.<br/>Jonathan Szanto has the same relation toward microtonal music that the<br/>Hillside Strangler had to women.<br/>Hermann Goering was reported to have said &quot;When I hear the word<br/>&grave;culture,&apos; I reach for my revolver.&quot;<br/>For Jonathan Szanto, the motto seems to be: &quot;When I hear the word<br/>&grave;composer,&apos; I reach for my revolver.&quot;<br/>Sue away, Szanto. I&apos;ll win with a directed judgment inside 5 minutes<br/>when the judge gets a printout of all the lies you&apos;ve told online.<br/>Then I&apos;ll countersue and take your house and take your car and take<br/>your bank account and take your furniture and take your musical<br/>instruments and county marshals will be standing outside your front<br/>door pasting up notices UNDER LIEN -- NOTICE OF PUBLIC AUCTION.<br/>The truth is a complete and total defense against charges of libel,<br/>Jonathan Szanto.<br/>And since I&apos;m telling the plain and simple truth when I state that you<br/>have lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and lied and lied in<br/>public, I have no fear of any legal action whatever.<br/>------<br/>Since as far as I can tell Jonathan Szanto has done essentially<br/>nothing for microtonal music but lie and lie and lie and lie online<br/>about the people who create it as well as tell lie after lie after lie<br/>after lie after lie after lie in person, nothing he says should be<br/>believed. In fact, Szanto offers a reliable source of information --<br/>if Szanto says it, the opposite must be true.<br/>Therefore when Jonathan Szanto tells Jacob Barton that:</p><p>&quot;For anyone finding their muse, and realizing that your muse happens<br/>to live down a different road in a different town in a different...<br/>you get the picture: it isn&apos;t going to be either easy or<br/>straight-forward,&quot;</p><p>Since Szanto said it, we know that this is a lie. As we would expect:<br/>essentially nothing comes out of Jonathan Szanto&apos;s mouth but lies, so<br/>naturally this is an obvious lie.<br/>In fact, getting involved with microtonal music is simple and easy.<br/>Microtonality is one of the &quot;hot&quot; topics in new music right now, and<br/>it&apos;s extremely popular on campus. Moreover, digital tuning devices<br/>have made it a snap to tune acoustic microtonal instruments. I helped<br/>Jonathan Glasier produce a set of 5-equal (240 cent per step)<br/>percussion instruments built from wood, glass and magnesium bars for<br/>the Exploratorium and it was so easy to tune those instruments you<br/>couldn&apos;t believe it. We used an old Stroboconn tuner -- much better<br/>digital tuners are available, but Jonathan used that one because, what<br/>the heck,  we had it around. And yet we were able to crank out that<br/>5-tone equal set of percussion instruments within a week.<br/>So Jonathan Szanto is of course lying when he claims there&apos;s anything<br/>difficult about making microtonal instruments. The reason Jonathan<br/>Szanto has to tell this lie is that otherwise, if you realized how<br/>simple and easy it is to handcraft microtonal acoustic instruments,<br/>Jacob, you&apos;d be in danger of producing microtonal music.<br/>And since Jonathan Szanto composes no microtonal music and performs no<br/>microtonal music, he has to tell lies to insure that no one else does.<br/>Sadly for Jonathan Szanto, plenty of people now produce microtonal<br/>music because it&apos;s soooooo easy and so much fun.<br/>If you prefer the all-electronic route, e-mail Jeff Scott. Jeff is one<br/>of the very finest practitioners of microtonal composition using<br/>softsynths (judging by his downloadable MP3s, anyway). Jeff is also a<br/>polymath.  That means &quot;someone who is expert in many different<br/>fields.&quot; It&apos;s rare indeed to encounter someone who is not only a<br/>superb musician, as Jeff Scott is, but also a world-class computer<br/>programmer and all-around digital hardware designer. Jeff designed the<br/>first PCI soundcard for the IBM personal computer, incidentally. So if<br/>softsynths are your game, you couldn&apos;t do better than consult with<br/>Jeff Scott.<br/>Speaking of softsynths, an awful lot of &apos;em are microtunable now. Not<br/>all -- but a lot, and more are becoming microtunable very day. The<br/>ranks of microtunable softsynths include VirSyn Cube 1.5 (a Fourier<br/>additive resynthesis softsynth), Crono-X, Angelina, Rhino, VAZ<br/>modular, Pro 53 (a software re-creation of the Prophet 5 but fully<br/>retunable), and many others. Reason is also microtunable though as I<br/>understand it not quite as easily as these others.<br/>The great thing about softsynths, and what makes &apos;em so easy to use,<br/>is that many of &apos;em can directly read SCALA .TUN files. This makes it<br/>effortless to set up a tuning and import it into the softsynth.<br/>So, as usual, Jonathan Szanto is telling yet another lie when he<br/>claims that it&apos;s &quot;difficult&quot; to get involved with microtonality. It&apos;s<br/>never been easier.<br/>Kiddo, I could tell you war stories... How about the time when I<br/>started composing microtonal music back in 1986 using the Upward<br/>Concepts alternative operating system for the Ensoniq Mirage. At that<br/>time, the Mirage was the ONLY commercially available synthesizer able<br/>to do full microtuning -- meaning, not just &quot;12 out of,&quot; which is<br/>worthless.<br/>Get this: I had to write a PASCAL program to convert the tuning I<br/>wanted into a set of tuning units (1024 per octave) and then I had to<br/> write another program to convert those into hexadecimal values.<br/>(That&apos;s base 16 numbers running from 1 through 9 and A,B,C,D,E,F.)<br/>Then I had to painstakingly punch each of those 128 hexadecimal<br/>2-digit numbers into the Mirage&apos;s two-digit display one at a time<br/>using a friggin&apos; keypad, and finally store &apos;em to floppy disk.<br/>Make a mistake?<br/>Whoops...do it all over again.<br/>Boy, you want to talk about difficult...?<br/>Yeesh. T*H*A*T was difficult.<br/>Microtuning nowadays is a snap. So as usual Jonathan Szanto has proved<br/>most informative -- as usual, what came out of his mouth was the exact<br/>opposite of the documented facts. Microtonality is simple and easy and<br/>fun. There&apos;s nothing to it. Easy to tune, easy to build acoustic<br/>instruments or use softsynths, easy to compose and record the music<br/>courtesy of digital audio recorders and sequencers/DXi/VSTi hosts.<br/>If Szanto&apos;s statement concerns the purported conceptual or emotional<br/>difficulty in swimming against the tide to compose microtonal music,<br/>once again Szanto is lying. Nowadays the tide on campus IS microtonal<br/>music. It&apos;s the hot new thing. Microtonality for today&apos;s adventurous<br/>young music students is about like prepared pianos in the<br/>1950s...everyone wants to do it. It&apos;s chic. It&apos;s hot. It&apos;s &quot;now.&quot; Very<br/>different from the 1980s when I started composing microtonal music.<br/>Back then, hardly anyone knew or cared what a non-12 tuning was. You<br/>mentioned &quot;17 tones per octave&quot; and people mumbled &quot;But aren&apos;t there<br/>12?&quot;  You mentioned 37-limit just intonation people muttered, &quot;Limit?<br/>Why would you want to limit your music..?&quot; Different story nowadays.<br/>Today, virtually every young composition students seems to feel<br/>compelled to turn out at least one microtonal piece just to capture<br/>some of the brio and elan of the cutting edge. So naturally Jonathan<br/>Szanto&apos;s statement systematically contradicts the facts, as always.<br/>SOP for Jonathan &quot;All Lies, All The Time&quot; Szanto.</p><p>Jonathan Szanto&apos;s next lie is:<br/>&quot;I happen to revere those who seize motivation and ideas and then go<br/>do something.&quot;<br/>Naturally the opposite is true. Jonathan Szanto has a long record of<br/>smearing and sliming anyone who composes microtonal music. Szanto&apos;s<br/>apparent goal is to ridicule and shred and rip and tear at anyone who<br/>does what he can&apos;t -- namely, compose and perform microtonal music and<br/>do first-rate microtonal scholarship.</p><p>Jonathan Szanto continues with his lies by claiming &quot;The best you can<br/>do is scan the horizon, be it real-world or virtual, gather as much<br/>information as you can, and go forward. DO NOT waste time if an<br/>avenue seems unproductive, and you have to trust your instincts on<br/>this.&quot;</p><p>Once again, an obvious lie. Jacob Barton&apos;s instincts led him to the<br/>Alternative Lying List -- and as we have seen from the pathetic<br/>specimens of humanity who crawled out of that cesspool to indulge in<br/>hysterical name-calling, trusting your instincts didn&apos;t work.<br/>Instead, trust your ears, Jacob.<br/>Ask Jonathan Szanto to send you at least five (5) of his CDs of<br/>microtonal music. When he can&apos;t, you&apos;ll know Szanto composes no<br/>microtonal music and performs no microtonal music and therefore you<br/>should believe nothing Szanto says.<br/>This is why I suggested that you listen to actual CDs of microtonal<br/>music instead of wasting your time with people like the insectile<br/>denizens of the ATL who do essentially nothing for microtonality but<br/>lie and lie and lie about the people who compose it, like Jonathan<br/>Szanto, and the proven liar and character assassin Gene &quot;Woolly-Headed<br/>Numerology&quot; Smith.</p><p>True to form, Jonathan Szanto continues telling lie after lie after<br/>lie in public by claiming not to remember one of his more recent lies.<br/>  The Jonathan Szanto specialty is not only telling lies, but then<br/>telling the lie that he never told the lie. In this case, the new lie<br/>Jonathan Szanto is telling is the implication that he never told the<br/>lie I cited when I pointed out</p><p>&quot;Szanto has immeasurably contributed to microtonality with posts like<br/>his recent comment &grave;It sounds like a root canal without anesthetic.&apos;<br/>Yes, you can always count on Jonathan Szanto to contribute to<br/>microtonality with invaluable passages like that one.&quot;</p><p>Szanto responded with the usual lie (by implication) that he never<br/>said what he actually did say:</p><p>&quot;I have no idea where that attribution goes, but if Brian would like<br/>to cite it...&quot;</p><p>[Here is the source of Szanto&apos;s quote.

Standard operating procedure for<br/>Jonathan &quot;Can&apos;t Tell the Truth To Save His Life&quot; Szanto. First Szanto<br/>lies, next he lies by implication about having told the lie.  We find<br/>this kind of behavior among pathological liars as a matter of course.<br/>The pathological liar not only cannot tell the truth about ordinary<br/>everyday matters, the pathological liar finds himself irresistibly<br/>compelled to lie about having lied...and then lie about having lied<br/>about having lied...and so on. An endless fractal regression of lies,<br/>lie upon lie upon lie.<br/>Typical behavior for Jonathan Szanto.<br/>Second, read the full text of meta music post 6907 by Szanto. Notice<br/>the smarmy faux-concern Szanto applies like balm to a torture victim<br/>whose genitals he&apos;s slowly scraping off with a rusty cheesegrater. In<br/>the sinister manner of one of the Inquisition torturers, Jonathan<br/>&quot;Just Gotta Lie&quot; Szanto enhances the torture, making it even _worse_<br/>by pretending to feel a phoney empathy for Gene even while attacking<br/>him. The Inquisition torturers loved to do this. They consoled their<br/>victims by telling them it was all being done for their good, out of<br/>love, in the name of the God of Love, as they cranked the rack and the<br/>victim&apos;s spine separated and blood spurted from their ears and eyes<br/>and mouth. That&apos;s another Jonathan Szanto speciality -- pretend to be<br/>deeply concerned about the victim of his pathological lies, even as<br/>the cranks the rack more and more brutally.<br/>The third point to be aware of is that Jonathan Szanto&apos;s description<br/>of Gene Smith&apos;s composition is a provable lie. Download Gene&apos;s<br/>composition in question. You can hear for yourself that it is NOT<br/>&quot;like a root canal with no anaesthesia...&quot;<br/>To see how obvious Jonathan Szanto&apos;s lie is, compare Gene&apos;s<br/>composition with a musical composition that actually is &quot;like a root<br/>canal with no anaesthesia.&quot; If you can find a CD of it, put on Lou<br/>Reed&apos;s &quot;Metal Machine Music.&quot; I think it&apos;s fair to say that just about<br/>everyone would agree that Lou Reed&apos;s &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; fits the<br/>definition of sounding &quot;like a root canal with no anaesthsia.&quot; (There<br/>are certain other compositions by the pop group Napalm Death that I<br/>could cite, but they&apos;re not so widely available.)<br/>The composition Gene wrote in this case, ripped to shreds and brutally<br/>savaged and sadistically ravaged with over-the-top verbal attacks by<br/>Jonathan &quot;If At First You Don&apos;t Succeed, Lie and Lie Again&quot; Szanto, is<br/>not even remotely like a &quot;a root canal without anaesthesia&quot; to my<br/>ears. And I think it&apos;s fair to say that essentially no reasonable<br/>human being could possibly call Gene&apos;s composition (brutally hacked to<br/>tatters with a verbal chainsaw by Jonathan &quot;Just Gotta Lie&quot; Szanto) &quot;a<br/>root canal without anaesthesia.&quot; So Szanto is just plain lying -- SOP<br/>for Jonathan Szanto, who seems compelled to lie and lie and lie and<br/>lie and lie, and then when he gets caught in a lie, lie by implication<br/>again, lie by innuendo, lie with Nixonian persistence and<br/>G.W.-Bush-like ardor, long past the point where everyone has realized<br/>there are no goddamn WMDs, and the goddamn tax cuts do NOT benefit the<br/>middle class, and it&apos;s all just lie after lie after lie, and yet the<br/>lies STILL keep coming.<br/>The lies keep coming...and coming...and coming. Insanely, without<br/>point, the lies keep coming from Szanto.  Just like the lies from the<br/>Bush white house. They keep coming...long after everyone KNOWS they&apos;re<br/>all lies...like the Energizer bunny, the lies just keep coming...and<br/>coming...and coming.<br/>The fourth and final point to be aware of is the sheer envenomed<br/>sadism hidden inside Jonathan Szanto&apos;s berserk verbal attack on Gene<br/>Smith. Y&apos;know, I really have to feel sorry for people like Gene when<br/>they become the victims of online predators like Jonathan Szanto. Yes,<br/>Smith has done more than his share of name-calling and hysterical<br/>invective...but even Gene Smith doesn&apos;t begin to compare with Jonathan<br/>Szanto for sheer depth of cruelty and breadth of verbal brutality.<br/>Watching Jonathan Szanto rip a microtonal composer apart is like<br/>watching the chainsaw scene in the Al Pacino remake of &quot;Scarface.&quot;<br/>It&apos;s so horrible you just want to hide your face.  You cringe. You<br/>feel nauseous. Vomit rises in your throat. You have to put your head<br/>between your knees...it&apos;s like watching a vivisection of a live<br/>animal, or a gang-rape of an infant.<br/>At least Gene is upfront about his verbal attacks. You know when Gene<br/>is coming at you with a meat hook. By contrast, Jonathan Szanto<br/>inhabits a special realm of thuggery, a truly unique pantheon of<br/>loathsomely venomous reptiles whose only joy in life seems to be to<br/>rip others to shreds and tear apart their life&apos;s work and with unholy<br/>sadistic glee brutalize and viciously verbally sodomize anyone and<br/>anything that smacks of creativity and imagination and<br/>excellence...all the while pretending to be the victim&apos;s best friend<br/>and closest buddy while wreaking his verbal carnage.<br/>We occasionally come across these kinds of human beings, who seem to<br/>have been born with a blank spot where a conscience should be. The<br/>teacher who ridicules a student for stuttering in front of the fifth<br/>grade class and takes unholy glee when the student later commits<br/>suicide... The boss who waits until Christmas eve to fire a pregnant<br/>woman whose husband just left her... The prison guard who watches a<br/>prisoner getting beaten up and then kills the _victim_ of the attack<br/>with a shotgun blast in the chest to stop the fight... (All taken from<br/>newspaper articles; all factual.)<br/>Yes, we&apos;ve all read about these kind of unspeakable atrocities carried<br/>out by stone-cold sociopaths. But it&apos;s seldom we encounter such<br/>specimens of human pathology in actual everyday life.<br/>Study Jonathan Szanto&apos;s behavior, ladies and gentlemen, and note it<br/>well. If you ever encounter someone who talks and acts like Jonathan<br/>Szanto on a lonely desert road when your car has broken down...<br/>RUN!</p></div><h3><a id=1275 href="#1275">ðŸ”—</a>Dante Rosati &#x3C;dante@...&#x3E;</h3><span>3/28/2004 2:44:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;Naturally, Dante Rosati has produced nothing worth mentioning in<br/>&gt;microtonality -- no scholarship of any significance, no music of any<br/>&gt;significance (his one CD is genuinely pathetic).</p><p>I dont have a CD you prolix baboon.</p></div>
