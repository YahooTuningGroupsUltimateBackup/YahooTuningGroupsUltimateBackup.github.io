I believe this is a good<br/>suggestion, so I will continue.</p><p>First off, as I have mentioned previously, are the practicioners of<br/>quarter-tone practice.  It&apos;s important to separate this set of<br/>performers from our new &quot;dedicated&quot; microtonalists, since they are an<br/>entirely different group of professionals, for the most part.</p><p>The &quot;quarter-toners&quot; actually consist of a rather large set, in fact,<br/>*MOST* young professionals today... I would say under the age of 30,<br/>CAN and DO ROUTINELY play quarter-tones as part of their<br/>technical &quot;arsenal.&quot;  This is only natural, since there are *very<br/>few* contemporary composers who have never written a single quarter<br/>tone in their works...</p><p>I say, of course, &quot;contemporary&quot; composers... and I&apos;m not including<br/>the so-called &quot;derriere garde&quot;  (there really *is* such a group!) who<br/>ape the 19th Century in this category...</p><p>Most performers, woodwind players especially, have fingering charts<br/>for quarter-tones, or they can get them.  Same with brass players.</p><p>When we get to *other* xenharmonics, however, there is more of a<br/>problem.</p><p>There are some individuals, actually some who are good friends of<br/>mine (!) who insist that woodwind players can play *any* xenharmonics.</p><p>I&apos;m a little skeptical by nature, and this skepticism extends to this<br/>previous statement.  I believe there is a verifiable reason why Lou<br/>Harrison in his _Piano Concerto_ for instance, restricts himself to<br/>trombones in the brass part, and includes no woodwinds.</p><p>It&apos;s not necessarily that Harrison has a &quot;special relationship&quot; with<br/>the trombone... only that they are *guaranteed* to be able to play<br/>xenharmonics...</p><p>I&apos;m not saying that increasing the ability of woodwind and brass<br/>players to do a variety of xenharmonics is not desirable (Wow...<br/>that&apos;s a great &quot;academic&quot; sentence -- it has *at least* TWO<br/>negatives) but merely that it is not accurately attainable among<br/>current, practicing, professional players who are not microtonal<br/>specialists.</p><p>Now as to notation:</p><p>What to do....?  Well, continuing my skepticism, I really doubt the<br/>ability of the majority of players to play within the accuracy of a<br/>cent... HOWEVER, the &quot;cents system&quot; as advocated by Johnny Reinhard<br/>and others, *does* make &quot;sense&quot; in the notation of xenharmonics.</p><p>I have a slight disagreement with Johnny that *multiple* notations of<br/>the same pitch are necessary.  (He believes because some people are<br/>familiar with certain cents indications for certain intervals, this<br/>is preferable.)  Since I have a somewhat systematic dogged streak in<br/>xenharmonics (let&apos;s call it &quot;swoop doggie dog&quot;) I believe it is only<br/>necessary to notate quartertones plus and minus 25 cents from the<br/>most proximate.  When one gets to 26 cents, the notation really<br/>should be a 24 cent deviation from the other, &quot;nearer&quot; quarter-<br/>tone...  Well, that&apos;s my *personal* bias...</p><p>In any case, the notation of quartertones plus and minus cents seems<br/>an entirely practical way to go.</p><p>HOWEVER, do to my constant education of my many friends on the<br/>Internet tuning forums, I have recently become infatuated with the<br/>Ezra Sims, Joe Maneri, Boston Clam Chowder and Red Sneaker Soup, New<br/>England Conservatory way of doing things:  72-tET.</p><p>It seems like a *very* practical ET for performance.  My recent<br/>studies have shown me that this ET not only contains 12-equal, but<br/>QUARTERTONES... and then only a few necessary &quot;adjustments.&quot;</p><p>As I have mentioned, most young contemporary players can play<br/>quartertones and (hopefully) they can play 12-tET ( :) ) so already<br/>there is a fundamental basis in 72-tET that players can &quot;latch onto&quot;<br/>as a reference...</p><p>So what needs to be learned?  Well, basically the 1/6th of a whole<br/>tone and the 1/12th of a whole tone.  As I have been shown, players<br/>can &quot;practice&quot; the 1/12th tone by playing a beatless major third...<br/>the syntonic comma in action.  Likewise, the 1/6 of a tone can be<br/>practiced through the septimal comma... the just &quot;blues&quot; minor 7th,<br/>as constrasted with 12-tET.</p><p>So, there are only two intervals to be learned throughout the entire<br/>range... the 1/6 whole tone and the 1/12 whole tone.</p><p>72-tET has embodied in it MANY subsets that have an extrordinary<br/>relationship to JI, if one is interested in that direction.  Or, if<br/>one wishes not to be too mesmerized with &quot;Moonieism&quot; one can try<br/>other possibilities with the scale that use other characteristics<br/>than the concordances.</p><p>Although the Sims notation is a bit, er, &quot;peculiar&quot; it is rather<br/>established in some quarters, at least with 20 years of history, and<br/>I would advocate going with this performance practice.</p><p>So, essentially, several PRACTICAL, LEARNABLE systems for<br/>xenharmonics *do* exist, and I believe it is *essential* that these<br/>be stressed with professional performers as, let us say, contrasted<br/>with a system of notation such as Ben Johnston&apos;s which is rather<br/>confounding to the performers and is ultimately, I believe,<br/>a &quot;turnoff...&quot;  (I&apos;m casting no aspersions on Ben Johnston&apos;s music...<br/>only on practical questions of his notation)</p><p>___________ ________ ________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
