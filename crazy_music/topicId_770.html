If we<br/>&gt;restrict ourselves to pieces for which MIDI files are available on<br/>&gt;the web, that&apos;s tantamount to severe observational selection. Only<br/>&gt;the simplest and least rhythmically and polyphonically and<br/>&gt;charomatically complex pieces of music are likely to be available on<br/>&gt;the web. At a guess, there are probably 8 bezillion versions of &quot;Fuer<br/>&gt;Elise&quot; and zero versions of the &quot;Grosse Fugue&quot; available on the web.</p><p>&gt;Well, that&apos;s not my concern. You asked me to pick pieces to<br/>&gt;retune. I picked &apos;em.</p><p>Perhaps you missed my post of July 20, in which I said:</p><p>[JdL:]<br/>&gt;&gt;Please let me know if you have any thoughts on a piece for the blind<br/>&gt;&gt;challenge, and I&apos;ll try to get it posted this weekend.  Natch, it has<br/>&gt;&gt;to be something that I can get ahold of an actual GM sequence of, and<br/>&gt;&gt;that I agree is appropriate (i.e., no serial pieces ;-&gt; ).</p><p>[mclaren:]<br/>&gt;I don&apos;t have the time to produce MIDI files of these pieces of<br/>&gt;music. So if you want me to spend weeks or months of my precious time<br/>&gt;generateing MIDI files to test your claims which have already been<br/>&gt;knocked down by a significant body of experimental psychoacoustic<br/>&gt;evidence...ain&apos;t gonna happen.  The burden of work must go to the<br/>&gt;person who desires to prove hi/r claims are accurate in the face of<br/>&gt;large amounts of evidence to the contrary.</p><p>Perhaps I have not made myself clear.  First, the only claim I have<br/>ever made with certainty is that _I_ like my own work.  We have, of<br/>course, had many posts on this very list from others who prefer my<br/>treatments of their own and past works - I can provide exact message<br/>citations if you&apos;ve missed them.  There have also been posts from<br/>people who _don&apos;t_ like my treatments.  I think the idea of a blind<br/>test is interesting, but I don&apos;t feel a need to move heaven and earth<br/>to meet someone else&apos;s idea of how it should be done.  I am content to<br/>please myself and let history determine how well my ideas are accepted<br/>by others.  OK?</p><p>I have offered to take the time to tune any sequence I&apos;m able to that<br/>you or anybody might find.  What I get from you is one demand after<br/>another.  Quite frankly, I feel that if I jumped those hurdles, you&apos;d<br/>find some others to throw up.  Please forgive me if I lose interest in<br/>trying to satisfy you.</p><p>&gt;You asked &quot;Why not just play all of each piece?&quot; or words to that<br/>&gt;effect.</p><p>&gt;The reson for not playing all of each piece in both versions is<br/>&gt;that this will give too many cues to listeners with a bias. For<br/>&gt;example, a diatonic solo melodic line rising from c to F will<br/>&gt;instantly give away the fact that it has been retuned to 5-limit JI<br/>&gt;because of the melodic unevenness twixt C and E and F.  Someone who<br/>&gt;is biased in favor of 5-limit JI or biased against 5-limit JI will<br/>&gt;pick up these differences by A-B&apos;ing between the various versions of<br/>&gt;complete piecces of music.</p><p>You seem obsessed with the idea that people will &quot;cheat&quot; because they<br/>are &quot;biased&quot;.</p><p>&gt;To avoid the possibility that listeners will systametically do<br/>&gt;A-B comparisons between identical sections of the same differently<br/>&gt;tuned composition, the sections presented from the same composition<br/>&gt;should not overlap.</p><p>I disagree.  I take it as given that people are of good will, have no<br/>particular axe to grind other than the promotion of beauty, and can<br/>be trusted with a complete A/B comparison.</p><p>&gt;Incidentally, if all this sounds lik e alot of work, you&apos;re<br/>&gt;right. Doing a serious double-blind trial involves tons of work.<br/>&gt;That&apos;s why people who claim to have conducted &quot;listening tests&quot;<br/>&gt;usually have not done such work, and consequently their claimed<br/>&gt;results don&apos;t mean much.</p><p>&gt;Inviting a couple of friends over for beer and a listening<br/>&gt;session to various versions of &quot;Feur Elise&quot; from a MIDI file pulled<br/>&gt;down off the net is not a serious test, and no one can take the<br/>&gt;results of such a &quot;listening test&quot; seriously.</p><p>Fine, then don&apos;t!  You seem quite certain you don&apos;t/won&apos;t like what I<br/>do; that&apos;s all that&apos;s really necessary for you, right?  If some others<br/>of us &quot;drink beer&quot; and enjoy the retuned music, that&apos;s no skin off your<br/>nose.</p><p>&gt;The alternative -- namely, choosing a variety of<br/>&gt;compositions, subselecting a set at random, creating hte MIDI files,<br/>&gt;producing 2 versions of the audio files, then encoding them into MP3<br/>&gt;and subsequently getting a computer to randomly rename and scramble<br/>&gt;the files, and finally uploaing &apos;em and analyzing the listener<br/>&gt;results with ANOVA and chi-square techniques -- involves tons of work.<br/>&gt;Well, that&apos;s the experimental method. It takes a whole lot of work to<br/>&gt;remove bias and make sure that apparent differences in results are<br/>&gt;not coming from the tester&apos;s bias or the listener playing A-B<br/>&gt;listener comparison games or otherwise cheating, or from stiatistical<br/>&gt;artifacts, or from other sources of error.</p><p>&gt;Welcome to the wonderful world of the objective double-<br/>&gt;blind experimental method.  Designing a good experiment is a subject<br/>&gt;grad students take courses in. People can take years to design an<br/>&gt;conduct a solid reliable experiment.</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s not trivial. It takes a lot of work. If you&apos;re not<br/>&gt;prepared to put in that kind of work, you may want to back off on<br/>&gt;your claims.</p><p>Exactly what are you claiming I&apos;ve claimed?  Of the two of us, _you_<br/>are the one who has made categorical claims (that 12-tET is universally<br/>preferred).  I know very well that this claim of _yours_ is false, at<br/>least for many people listening to my work, but I have no particular<br/>need to prove that you&apos;re wrong.  No amount of tests could convince you<br/>otherwise in any case, given how &quot;certain&quot; you are.  Just believe<br/>whatever you want to!</p><p>&gt;As for entering the MIDI files, doesn&apos;t there exist<br/>&gt;software today which can scan in scores and produce MIDI files?<br/>&gt;MIDISCAN or something like that?</p><p>&gt;I can provide scores for each and every one of these<br/>&gt;pieces (most of &apos;em are for the piano and use only 2 staves), so if<br/>&gt;you can find someone with MIDISCAN (or whatever the software&apos;s<br/>&gt;called), creating MIDI files should not be a problem.</p><p>I don&apos;t know what exists in that regard.  There are thousands of GM<br/>sequences on <a href="http://prs.net">prs.net</a>, a lot more than &quot;Feur Elise&quot;.

For<br/>&gt; example, a diatonic solo melodic line rising from c to F will<br/>&gt; instantly give away the fact that it has been retuned to 5-limit JI<br/>&gt; because of the melodic unevenness twixt C and E and F.</p><p>Let&apos;s put aside the fact that a diatonic solo melodic line rising<br/>from C to F is already such a short snippet of music that it&apos;s far<br/>too short to demostrate many of the capabilities of John&apos;s adaptive<br/>tuning program -- so saying it&apos;s too long because it gives away too<br/>many clues is dooming this entire experiment from the start.</p><p>Let&apos;s focus on the statement itself.</p><p>Brian (I&apos;m speaking in the third person because that&apos;s how he does<br/>it) clearly doesn&apos;t know the difference between strict JI and<br/>adaptive JI (let alone adaptive tuning).</p><p>In strict JI, the whole step between C and D and the whole step<br/>between D and E will usually be audibly unequal -- one of the whole<br/>steps being 9:8 and the other being 10:9. This difference is about 21<br/>1/2 cents.</p><p>In adaptive JI, in its raw form, the sizes of these steps will<br/>usually be much closer to equal. In Vicentino&apos;s second tuning of<br/>1555, for example, they will typically be only 5 1/2 cents different.<br/>In John&apos;s program the reason is that most pieces of music involve<br/>many of the pitches in many harmonic relationships, and John&apos;s<br/>program finds a COFT -- a fixed temperament -- that best &quot;averages<br/>out&quot; these harmonic desiderata. This harmonic &quot;averaging out&quot; usually<br/>results in a melodic &quot;averaging out&quot; of the whole steps in the COFT<br/>so that each can stand for both 9:8 and 10:9 in the lattice. Finally,<br/>the process of finding the final, fully adaptive tuning involves<br/>grounding to COFT and, though it may tend to introduce larger<br/>inequalities between step sizes, these inequalities are still usually<br/>much smaller than those in strict JI.</p><p>Furthermore, John deL. has recently introduced an option in his<br/>program that, if activated, tends to equalize the melodic major<br/>seconds, and also to equalize the melodic minor seconds.</p><p>By the way, my personal view is that Brian is making this whole<br/>subject (even though he doesn&apos;t understand what the program does) 100<br/>times more complex than necessary.</p><p>Let&apos;s just focus on the psychoacoustic aspect of JI versus non-JI<br/>harmonies, since that&apos;s what Brian focused on, and let&apos;s look at one<br/>of the studies he brought up.</p><p>Matthews and Robinson found that some listeners -- call them &quot;pure&quot;<br/>listeners -- dislike deviation from just ratios, whether that&apos;s<br/>because of the beating (the most obvious explanation) or for some<br/>more mysterious reason. Other listeners like the deviation (if it&apos;s<br/>not too large) and presumably the beating that&apos;s associated with it.<br/>So clearly John&apos;s program is going to &quot;improve&quot; pieces from the point<br/>of view of the &quot;pure&quot; listeners, and not from the point of view of<br/>the &quot;rich&quot; listeners. John, and Carl Lumma, are &quot;pure&quot; listeners. So<br/>they like the results of the program. Others won&apos;t. Most of us<br/>(Joseph Pehrson, for example), can clearly hear that John&apos;s program<br/>is making the harmonies more &quot;pure&quot;, or slowing down the<br/>beating . . . without necessarily having to make an aesthetic<br/>decision about whether that&apos;s an improvement or not. So to most of<br/>us, the program &quot;works&quot; -- it does what it was made to do. A few<br/>others hear no difference.</p><p>That&apos;s all there is to it (ignoring the issue of comma shifts, which<br/>was a major obstacle in the way of making musically viable &quot;JI&quot;<br/>renditions in past centuries, but John&apos;s explicitly reduces such<br/>shifts to normally inaudible intervals -- thanks in part to my<br/>repeatedly hearing such shifts in earlier versions of the program).<br/>What&apos;s a double-blind &quot;preference&quot; experiment going to prove? Some<br/>people will prefer the reduction of beating, some people won&apos;t, and<br/>still others won&apos;t hear the difference. So the results of John&apos;s<br/>program will be &quot;preferred&quot; by the former group but not the other two<br/>groups. But we already know that!</p></div><h3><a id=807 href="#807">ðŸ”—</a>Paul Erlich &#x3C;paul@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/30/2001 6:16:23 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote,</p><p>&gt; Matthews and Robinson</p><p>Oops -- I meant Mathews and Roberts.</p></div>
