Most<br/>mathematicians I have known, including myself, were fascinated with<br/>music, listened to classical music from an early age, and were at<br/>least for parts of their younger lives performers, though many<br/>dropped out of music once the urge to be mathematicians took hold.<br/>Yet most musicians are *not* fascinated by mathematics, most don&apos;t<br/>show an early talent for math and drop it in favor of music. Of<br/>course, the same has been said of mathematics and humor and<br/>mathematics and numerous other fields.</p><p>Let&apos;s face it -- not everybody can do math. Even fewer do it well and<br/>many, myself among them, use math primarily as a tool rather than<br/>being into the deep theory for theory&apos;s own sake. The thought of<br/>devoting my life to abstract theoretical math at the same time bores<br/>and frightens me.</p><p>What I think is undeniable, though, is that mathematicians, probably<br/>starting with the Sumerians if we are to believe Joe Monzo, and<br/>certainly no later than the Golden Age of ancient Greece, put music,<br/>humor, logic, rhetoric, physics and many other subjects under their<br/>scrutiny with the aim of applying their tools. I&apos;m not at all sure we<br/>mathematicians know more about music *now* than we did in the days of<br/>Pythagoras.<br/>--<br/>M.

I can<br/>neither keep up with the posting volume nor the<br/>references.</p><p>However, for those who feel like they have to choose<br/>sides in life (Partch vs Schoenberg, math versus<br/>feelings, this tuning list versus other tuning lists),<br/>I&apos;ll just make a few points.</p><p>Where Brian blames Schoenberg for the<br/>Music School politics of sixty years after he<br/>published his theoretical offerring, I commend him<br/>trying to figure out where to go after Mahler et al<br/>blew up the major/minor system, for having helped<br/>Berg and Webern find their paths, and for directly or<br/>indirectly influencing many composers who I have enjoyed<br/>in the twentieth century. This is all besides his own<br/>music and artwork (which I don&apos;t have a great familiarity<br/>with except for Verlachte Nachte which is a fav).</p><p>We can easily see that his math was wrong regarding<br/>overtone series and 12tet etc, but this really has no<br/>impact on all the other things I mentioned.</p><p>Similarly, Brian takes some research that indicates that<br/>we still don&apos;t know how the &quot;mind&quot; works, and since it<br/>indicates that &quot;logic&quot; and &quot;emotion&quot;, &quot;small picture&quot;<br/>and &quot;big picture&quot; are processed in different parts and<br/>different ways that he has &quot;proved&quot; that &quot;math has no<br/>relationship to music&quot;. I look at the same data and see<br/>that things are much more mixed than that, the point that<br/>damaged emotional capability resulted in damaged rational<br/>capability for instance. I understand enough about math<br/>to know that the &quot;Eureka&quot; moment is in the &quot;big picture&quot;<br/>part of the brain. I understand enough about polishing<br/>a song or a painting to know that in art, there is &quot;small<br/>picture&quot; activity going on during the &quot;work&quot; phase (for<br/>instance in painting, adding something for &quot;balance&quot;. In<br/>writing a song, the decision on whether addition of a<br/>bridge, or a different harmonization, detracts from the<br/>essance or provides enough &quot;counter-example&quot; that the<br/>essance is amplified.</p><p>Brian, you posted MP3s, one of which is titled something<br/>about 37 limit JI, one is titled something about 53, and<br/>one is titled something about 1/4tone19. What is the point<br/>of these numbers and why aren&apos;t they math? Can I interchange<br/>those titles and have them equally valid?</p><p>I assume not because you were discussing issues there that<br/>can be made most clear by using numbers. You were using<br/>numbers and indeed math because it communicated something<br/>about the components that went into your creation of that<br/>sound. When Dan Stearns posts a list of cents, he is<br/>posting very clear information about a music system. I can<br/>go try it. When we say this or that ET has &quot;good fifths&quot;,<br/>you are saying something that can be expressed quite easily<br/>numerically, and if it doesn&apos;t hold in all cases, so what,<br/>we are talking about music.</p><p>Now one could say &quot;using numbers to communicate is not the<br/>same as math&quot; (though you slammed me and Dan for posting<br/>information in numerical form, as if it was math). But I<br/>think that it is a slippery slope that shows that &quot;no<br/>relation to music&quot; is a bit of an overstatement. Obviously<br/>if math can model music (as it models gravity and a lot<br/>of other things), then there is something in the way the<br/>brain and/or the universe works that has a &quot;relation&quot;.</p><p>Oh well. I did download your music and was impressed. The<br/>hardest part in all this business is getting decent timbral<br/>renderring from all this miserable technology and you&apos;ve<br/>certainly paid your dues. Its good music and it sounds that<br/>way too.</p><p>Thanks also for bringing up what could be a very interesting<br/>discussion, the difference between discursive arts and non-<br/>discursive arts. Perhaps information content decreases in<br/>the arts in the following order. Perhaps this is also the<br/>order with which mathematical modelling is attempted with<br/>greater or lesser amounts of success. Note these classes<br/>do have a fair amount of overlap, expressionist painting<br/>(NOT abstract expressionist painting) and photography are<br/>somewhat different on the information spectrum, as are<br/>John Cage and Ralph Vaughn Williams.</p><p>    music   dance<br/>   abstart visual art<br/>       poetry<br/> representative visual art<br/>       prose</p><p>Beats me, its the weekend, I should paint and play.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=398 href="#398">ðŸ”—</a>jpehrson@...</h3><span>7/14/2001 10:17:33 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., xed@e... wrote:</p><p><a href="/crazy_music/topicId_unknown.html#321">/crazy_music/topicId_unknown.html#321</a></p><p>&gt; FROM: mclaren<br/>&gt; TO : new practical microtonality group<br/>&gt; SUBJECT: Post 1 of 11 providing evidence<br/>&gt;           that mathematics has no relation<br/>&gt;           to music<br/>&gt;</p><p>This is one of the most valuable posts on music and thinking that I<br/>have ever read...  looking forward to the others.</p><p>_________ _______ _________<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div>
