I like it. It sounds like it<br/>has that medievally thing happening.&quot; How about the<br/>tuning? &quot;It sounds fine. It&apos;s a little bit different<br/>but doesn&apos;t sound weird or anything.&quot;</p><p>Chowning improv is &quot;The first part was annoying. I<br/>guess she was just playing with the tones. Dee, doo,<br/>dee, doo, dee, doo dee ... dah dum dah dum dah dum dah.<br/>Not as interesting as the first.&quot;</p><p>-------</p><p>Here are mine:</p><p>On first listen, I found the 14th to be more odd in<br/>tuning that Chowning -- the Chowning piece sounded more<br/>conventional to me.</p><p>On second listen, the tunings normalized to my ears<br/>(this is what usually happens for me). I liked the<br/>cadences in the 14th piece. All the chord progressions<br/>in both pieces I found to be striking and of great<br/>interest as they &apos;tickled&apos; my ears. I like what you are<br/>doing in these pieces.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
