Scott &#x3C;xjscott@...&#x3E;</h3><span>1/24/2002 7:33:00 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hey all,</p><p>Here are some thoughts.</p><p>If you were to add the numbers 24 and 18, how would you<br/>do it?</p><p>Or better yet, if you were teaching an beginning math<br/>student how to add two numbers -- what approach would<br/>you use?</p><p>Perhaps you would start by noting that 24 = 6 * 4<br/>and that 18 = 6 * 3. That&apos;s interesting! Both contain<br/>the number 6. Let&apos;s go further. 6 * 4 = 3*2 * 2*2 and<br/>6 * 3 = 3*2 * 3. Now both numbers have been broken into<br/>prime factorizations. That&apos;s a useful thing to be able<br/>to do. But it&apos;s getting kind of complicated looking.<br/>Let&apos;s use the caret notation to mean &apos;raised to the<br/>power of&apos;, so we have 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 3^1 * 2^3 and<br/>3 * 2 * 3 = 3 * 3 * 2 = 3^2 * 2^1.</p><p>So what we are REALLY doing is trying to add:</p><p>  3^1 * 2^3<br/>+ 3^2 * 2^1<br/>-----------<br/>  ?????????</p><p>How do we do the next step? Well, the calculator tells<br/>us that 24 + 18 = 42 and 42 is *really* 21 * 2 which is<br/>7 * 3 * 2 which is 7^1 * 3^1 * 2^1. But don&apos;t forget<br/>that 5 is between 7 and 3 and is also a prime number,<br/>so we should properly represent 42 as  7^1 * 5^0 * 3^1<br/>* 2^1.</p><p>So what we really are getting to is:</p><p>  7^0 * 5^0 * 3^1 * 2^3<br/>+ 7^0 * 5^0 * 3^2 * 2^1<br/>-----------------------<br/>  7^1 * 5^0 * 3^1 * 2^1</p><p>Hm, it&apos;s still not entirely clear how to get the sum<br/>here, perhaps we should simplify it a bit:</p><p>Now we know what the prime numbers are, so we<br/>don&apos;t really actually need to write them, we<br/>could just write the exponents and that would tell us<br/>all the information we need to know. Let&apos;s write the<br/>exponents as a vector why not:</p><p>   &lt;0 0 1 3&gt;<br/> + &lt;0 0 2 1&gt;<br/>------------<br/>   &lt;1 0 1 1&gt;</p><p>Hm, certainly there must be some sort of intuitive<br/>vector operation we could apply here to get the sum<br/>from the result. Something easy so we can teach our<br/>student to do it in the most efficient way possible.</p><p>Any ideas? My student is getting frustrated it seems<br/>and is looking out the window at the goats.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
