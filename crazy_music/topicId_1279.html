Johnson&quot; &lt;akjmicro@c...&gt;<br/>Date:  Thu Apr 8, 2004  3:41 am<br/>Subject:  Gene--do you have a Yahoo ID?......</p><p>&quot;(..) I also have a lot of technical math curiosity<br/>questions to ask you---I need a &apos;tuning math tutor&apos;.&quot;<br/>---------------<br/>&quot;At the heart of science is an essential tension between two<br/>seemingly contradictory attitudes -- an openness to new<br/>ideas, no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive they may<br/>be, and the most ruthless skeptical scrutiny of all ideas,<br/>old and new. This is how deep truths are winnowed from deep<br/>nonsense. Of course, scientists make mistakes in trying to<br/>understand the world, but there is a built-in error-<br/>correcting mechanism: The collective enterprise of creative<br/>thinking and skeptical thinking together keeps the field on<br/>track.&quot; -- [Sagan, Carl, &quot;The Fine Art of Baloney<br/>Detection,&quot; from &quot;The Demon-Haunted World,&quot; 1992]<br/>------------<br/>Instead of wallowing in mindless superstition, suppose we<br/>apply critical thinking and the test of evidence...</p><p>Why does any musician need a &quot;tuning math tutor&quot;?  Where is<br/>the hard objectively verifiable evidence for this assertion?</p><p>Let us see it. Where is it?</p><p>What is the objectively verifiable evidence that proves math<br/>has any causal connection or explanatory power for music?<br/>How do we know math plays any more of a role in music than a<br/>table of the annual rainfall statistics of the Amazon basin?</p><p>When faced with a  question, what does a reasonable person do?</p><p>Does a reasonable person spend his life pursuing some wacky<br/>notion he read on the internet just because somebody made<br/>the claim without offering a shred of proof?</p><p>A flat-earther or a psychic surgeon would would say<br/>&quot;yes.&quot; Such people typically read a pamphlet handed out<br/>by some guy with a shaved head and then spend the rest<br/>of their lives enslaved by that vacuous superstition.<br/>But is that how a reasonable person behaves?</p><p>Or does a reasonable person instead apply &quot;the most<br/>ruthless skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, old and new&quot; and<br/>first ascertain whether a claim actually has some<br/>objectively verifiable relationship to observed reality?</p><p>So let us apply common sense and the test of reality to Aaron<br/>K. Johnson&apos;s post.</p><p>What is the hard objectively verifiable evidence that math<br/>has any causal connection to music?  What is the hard<br/>objectively verifiable evidence that math has any<br/>explanatory power for music?</p><p>Aaron K. Johnson goes on to aver:<br/>&quot;The irony is that I *adore* math... (..) Ultimately, I want<br/>the math to serve the music.&quot;</p><p>What is the evidence that math serves music in any meaningful<br/>way?</p><p>What is the hard objectively verifiable evidence that math<br/>has any meaningful connection to music at all?</p><p>Which listening tests, performed by which tenured professors<br/>at which accredited university, and published in which reputable<br/>peer-reviewed scientific journals, prove that mathematics has any<br/>causal connection with, or explanatory power for, music?</p><p>What are the issue numbers and the volume numbers and the<br/>page numbers of the peer-reviewed journal articles of listening<br/>experiments which prove that Aaron K. Johnson&apos;s assertions about the<br/>alleged connection of math with music are true?</p><p>=========</p><p>&quot;One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we&apos;ve<br/>been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence<br/>of the bamboozle. We&apos;re no longer interested in finding out<br/>the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It is simply too<br/>painful to acknowledge -- even to ourselves -- that we&apos;ve<br/>been so credulous. (So the old bamboozles tend to persist as<br/>the new bamboozles rise.)&quot; -- [Sagan, Carl, &quot;The Fine Art of<br/>Baloney Detection,&quot; from &quot;The Demon-Haunted World,&quot; 1992]<br/>---------<br/>--mclaren</p></div>
