Reminds<br/>me of a starry sky.</p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/improvisations.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/improvisations.htm</a></p><p>Also, done an upload of new version of FTS. This has a new view as<br/>a highly experimental retuning midi player. At present, only plays<br/>midi format 0 files. May well have bugs, but may be fun to try it<br/>out - you can also speed it up / slow it down while it plays.<br/>Also, loop it endlessly. I&apos;ll be adding other things for sure later.</p><p>To change the temperament for playing a twelve tone midi clip, just choose<br/>any tuning that has a diatonic major scale as one of<br/>the modes, and notes in between to play the accidentals - if the<br/>scale has, say, 15 steps to a tone, it will play the sharps as +7,<br/>and the flats as -7 steps from the major scale notes.</p><p>(It was because of programming this that I got into exploring<br/>the 55-tet major scale incidentally).</p><p>If the clip is already in some temperament and you want to try<br/>another one, then tick to ignore any pitch bends already in it.</p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/ftsbeta.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/ftsbeta.htm</a></p><p>There&apos;s no time out for the retuning midi player if using the<br/>freebie version of FTS. I may decide to keep it that way too<br/>(since one can get good midi player programs for free anyway); would<br/>be nice.</p><p>Bugs are to be expected at this stage; comments welcomed!</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=1118 href="#1118">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/1/2001 7:26:45 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Jacky,</p><p>Glad you like it.</p><p>I&apos;ve just added another improv. in WIII.</p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/improvisations.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~robertinventor/tunes/improvisations.htm</a></p><p>Robert</p></div>
