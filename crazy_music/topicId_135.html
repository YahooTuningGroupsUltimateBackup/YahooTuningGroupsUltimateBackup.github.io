Here the resolution is &quot;remissive,&quot; with a descending<br/>semitone at 28:27 or ~62.96 cents (Fv4-E4); and an ascending<br/>whole-tone at 9:8 or ~203.91 cents (G3-A3).</p><p>Here&apos;s another resolution of the same sonority, an &quot;intensive&quot; one<br/>with ascending 28:27 semitones and a descending 9:8 whole-tone:</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/sesen002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/sesen002.mid</a></p><p>Fv4 Ebv4<br/>D4  Ebv4<br/>Cv4 Abv3<br/>G3  Abv3</p><p>These examples are based on a 24-note keyboard tuning with two<br/>Pythagorean manuals a pure 7:6 apart. If anyone is curious, I could<br/>describe the arrangements of these progressions on such a keyboard,<br/>but maybe that&apos;s more of a topic for the main Tuning List.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=136 href="#136">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/13/2001 10:08:17 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo!<br/>    Boy are those Juicy!

Could it be a &quot;schisma-like&quot;<br/>third close to a ratio of 5:4, for example?</p><p>A bit of arithmetic suggested that it had a size of about (678 - 267)<br/>cents, or roughly 411 cents (actually a bit closer to 412 cents). At<br/>least on a Yamaha TX-802 with the &quot;Puff Pipes&quot; timbre (voice A56),<br/>this was just the perfect size.</p><p>Now I wanted to use this incredibly beautiful third in a three-voice<br/>cadence, one which had an actual &quot;Wolf fourth&quot; between the upper<br/>voices of the first sonority at around 0-412-933 cents:</p><p><a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/seswf001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/seswf001.mid</a></p><p>Here is this cadence written in a notation where &quot;v&quot; shows a note a<br/>septimal comma lower than the usual Pythagorean note, with C4 as<br/>middle C:</p><p>G#4  Av4<br/>Eb4  Ev4<br/>Bv3  Av4</p><p>The outer voices of the first sonority form a pure 12:7 major sixth,<br/>while the lower voices form that exquisite major third at what turns<br/>out to be the pleasant ratio of 524288:413343 or about 411.62 cents.</p><p>The two upper voices at Eb4-G#4 form the Pythagorean &quot;Wolf&quot; fourth or<br/>augmented third at 177147:131072 (~521.505 cents), not really a<br/>dissonance in this sonority and timbre, just another element in the<br/>brew, maybe a touch of &quot;color&quot; or &quot;deepening&quot; of hue.</p><p>From my keyboardist&apos;s eye view, the extra bit of humor was that the<br/>major third looked _visually_ like a Wolf fifth, as a keyboard<br/>spelling with &quot;}&quot; showing a note on the upper keyboard raised by a 7:6<br/>may suggest:</p><p>G#4   F#}4<br/>Eb4   C#]4<br/>G#}3  F#}3</p><p>Whatever the fine points of theory and keyboard navigation, I find it<br/>a beautiful JI progression, and wanted to share it as an example of<br/>&quot;running with the Wolves.&quot;</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3><a id=140 href="#140">ðŸ”—</a>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2001 6:47:51 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, Kraig!</p><p>Thanks to you and Erv Wilson for your encouragement, and among other<br/>things I guess it&apos;s time to get some papers together for Erv.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the JI example of &quot;running with the Wolves&quot; I&apos;m<br/>posting, and thanks for the humor of your posts, a great creative<br/>element.</p><p>Peace to all, with deepest appreciation,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=141 href="#141">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/14/2001 10:47:53 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo!<br/>    Yes honestly i have enjoyed these tremendously , clicking them over<br/>and over again.

As my everyday<br/>musical language, I take it for granted in a sense -- although I&apos;m<br/>always interested in new possibilities and intonational twists.<br/>However, what I also take for granted is that the setting is fluid,<br/>with lots of possible continuations or conclusions. There are many<br/>possible modal centers, and the same cadence might occur in pieces<br/>concluding on different centers.</p><p>One writer comments that in some 14th-century pieces, a cadence can<br/>happen at almost every measure of a modern transcription -- and that&apos;s<br/>pretty much a given for me.</p><p>Your response maybe gives me some idea of what this might sound like<br/>to someone not accustomed to it, and I&apos;m delighted that the same music<br/>can present different colors when heard through different &quot;aural<br/>prisms&quot; of previous experience and expectations.</p><p>In a larger piece, of course, the form and things like repetition and<br/>emphasis might make some centers seem more &quot;central&quot; than others; but<br/>the openness and fluidity of modal music is something I much treasure,<br/>all the more so when I can share it with such musicians and friends.</p><p>Peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3><a id=158 href="#158">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/16/2001 11:19:49 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo!<br/>    Thank you for the lovely sequence and a fitting end to this mess by<br/>your observant comments.</p><p>mschulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello, there, Kraig Grady -- and also David Finnamore and everyone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Here&apos;s a cadential chain of one type in JI that might address your<br/>&gt; post, and thanks for the encouragement to get this into a MIDI file.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/xgji001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/xgji001.mid</a><br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=172 href="#172">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>6/18/2001 10:39:25 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello there,</p><p>&gt; <a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/xgji001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/xgji001.mid</a></p><p>&gt; In a larger piece, of course, the form and things like repetition and<br/>&gt; emphasis might make some centers seem more &quot;central&quot; than others; but<br/>&gt; the openness and fluidity of modal music is something I much treasure,<br/>&gt; all the more so when I can share it with such musicians and friends.</p><p>This seems to have something of the attractive floating quality one<br/>can get with the hexany.</p><p>I&apos;m enjoying your midi clips a lot.
