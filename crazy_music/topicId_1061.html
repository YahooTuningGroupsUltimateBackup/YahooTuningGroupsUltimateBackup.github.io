For instance,<br/>&gt; an 0.1 second clip at 440 Hz gives a freq resolution of +- 10<br/>&gt; cents - not very good!</p><p>&gt; However, one can improve the accuracy considerably, maybe<br/>&gt; achieve a tenfold improvement of accuracy, by using peak<br/>&gt; interpolation. The method is to look not just at the highest<br/>&gt; amplitude of the frequency bins, but also the two bins to<br/>&gt; either side. Then by fitting a curve to it, you can estimate<br/>&gt; where the real peak should be, on assumption that it is a<br/>&gt; response to a single frequency partial.</p><p>Hi Robert &amp; Brian!</p><p>When you do an FFT, half the data in the frequency<br/>domain you get is phase information. Brian&apos;s analysis<br/>I think assumes that one is just tossing out the phase<br/>info, which is what is actually done during some FFT<br/>processing. But if you keep the phase data you can also<br/>analyze it to improve your frequency resolution and<br/>also do neat tricks like Settel &amp; Lippe have done to<br/>oh-so-cleverly separate harmonic and inharmonic<br/>information. The improved frequency info you get by<br/>looking at phase info is part of the selling point of<br/>the phase vocoder, which works this way using the FFT.</p><p>Anyway I think a lot of the original post was based on<br/>some assumptions that are not necessary.</p><p>Also the proof is in the pudding since FFT analysis and<br/>its variants are productively used by many to get great<br/>results.</p><p>Also, there are ways of getting around (eliminating)<br/>the trade off between frequency resolution and time<br/>resolution. My stating that such methods exist should<br/>be sufficient to trigger an &apos;aha!&apos; in the sufficiently<br/>clever reader. (Right, Robert? It&apos;s easy once you<br/>realize that it -can- be gotten around easily. I&apos;m<br/>betting you&apos;ll be able to guess this one fairly<br/>easily.)</p><p>Thanks for your great tips Robert. You speak from<br/>experience.</p><p>Cheers all,</p><p>Jeff</p></div>
