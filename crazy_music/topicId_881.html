This is kinda catchy!</p><p>Are you serious, Jacky?</p><p>Well yahoo has made it real easy. Someone did write me<br/>about his own experience trying out a group name change<br/>and there was some tricky thing about unexpected side<br/>effects but I think it does work.</p><p>I don&apos;t know though, we would have to go and look and<br/>make sure that the new name isn&apos;t already taken... it<br/>could be, you know.</p><p>The thing is though I&apos;ve been reading posts in some of<br/>the other groups that show that people are really fond<br/>of the name &apos;crazy music&apos; now.</p><p>Actually I will go ahead and change it if the other<br/>list changes its name to &apos;The old Alternative Wanking<br/>List&quot;. You know, to make sure there&apos;s no confusion.</p><p>BTW, what&apos;s wanking? Is it like walking? Or wanting?</p><p>&gt; I couldn&apos;t agree more mclaren! Damn - I was getting really<br/>&gt; tired of having to speak about the Mating Patterns of<br/>&gt; Mollusks, but since be had strayed so far from the topic of<br/>&gt; MUSIC, thought I&apos;d dive in meself with some tangents.</p><p>Huh! Well get back here young man. We are not done with<br/>Mollusks yet. I have much more to say. Their mating<br/>behavior is the key to understanding music perception<br/>and I will prove it!! I&apos;ve just been busy with the<br/>ezine article and such lately but I DO plan to return<br/>to this extremely important and relevant subject!</p><p>&gt; Whew - glad somebody has steered the ship back on course! Was<br/>&gt; beginning to wonder if we would be lost at sea and become<br/>&gt; Mollusk food.</p><p>I really liked your limerick on mollusk eating. Have<br/>you ever tried sea cucumbers? Real chewy and they don&apos;t<br/>taste like much. Some of the nudibranches are<br/>poisonous, BTW, so you need to be careful.</p><p>&gt; Big question: What the heck has happened to folks uploading<br/>&gt; music here? Jeff uploaded one a while back then I did (thanks<br/>&gt; to Bob and George for your kind replies - guess nobody wanted<br/>&gt; to touch that meend topic). Has the well run dry folks? Guess<br/>&gt; I&apos;m going to have to kick one out for us here in the next few<br/>&gt; days.</p><p>&gt; Yep - little old Feral Boy.</p><p>Well I can only speak for myself. My music posts come<br/>when they come and that&apos;s all I&apos;ll say about it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&quot;big ideas&quot; roll a naked girl in paint across a piece<br/>&gt;&gt; of manuscript paper, play a &apos;cello in the nude</p><p>These are really the only two methods I have found that<br/>work.</p><p>&gt; The question I return to again and again is: &quot;What about a<br/>&gt; piece of music makes me and other wish to hear it<br/>&gt; repeatedly&quot;.</p><p>Don&apos;t know but that is really the only litmus test<br/>worth considering. Defenestate the rest.</p><p>...</p><p>Hm, that&apos;s a long post. I&apos;ll have to get back to it<br/>later...</p><p>- J</p></div>
