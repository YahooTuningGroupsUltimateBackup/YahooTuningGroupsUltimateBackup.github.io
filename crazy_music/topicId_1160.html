At Faust-Harrison on 9 January<br/>Lawrence invites you to share the open process of spontaneous discovery.<br/>His music is, by turns, deeply reflective, very simple, often very<br/>intricate, sometimes highly animated, but comes always from the wish to<br/>express the essential and the transcendent.</p><p>His style owes something to many American composers, particularly Terry<br/>Riley&apos;s and LaMonte Young&apos;s influence over 30 years, he being one of the<br/>first British composers to significantly value their respective musics. To<br/>hear Lawrence play is to be challenged into a deep but active listening to a<br/>calm intensity - the emphasis is on depth and awe rather than on virtuosity.</p><p>full biography:</p><p>Lawrence Ball is a versatile and innovative composer who has a multiple<br/>focus as a composer,improviser and audio-visual creator.
