The music is sonorous, good, harmonious, often experimental<br/>and pioneeringly inventive good relations with all manner of creative,<br/>spiritual, scientific (and other good works) folk, which I have often (not<br/>always) experienced with lively vibrant innovative melodic dialogue.</p><p>This is highly applicable (believe me, or, try an experiment first before<br/>dismissing it) theory, I have made a lot of miraculous experiential music<br/>with it (music is actually not acoustic - sorry guys/guyesses - but is<br/>actually human energetic expression at root).</p><p>hate opposes hate<br/>hate opposes love<br/>but, love devours hate (that is you might say it discharges or evaporates<br/>it)</p><p>Try this simple experiment (or don&apos;t , as you wish!)</p><p>1) Criticise someone you disagree with - do you think it will be easier for<br/>them to empathise with you? See if they do.</p><p>2) Try expressing something that you find in common with someone, with<br/>empathy. At the least you will win some respect, if not a useful kindred<br/>sense.</p><p>I can see that old patterns die hard, (mine certainly do!).</p><p>I can see that the Tuning group&apos;s fervent theoretical activity (particularly<br/>the MIRACLE tuning) made it hard for folk to express their sometimes<br/>vulnerable creative concerns and emerging reflections on creating their<br/>music, especially when folk appeared territorial and sent posts like<br/>snowstorms.</p><p>Its hard for a list to remain open to a varied degree of focal points of<br/>opinion and orientation when one or two folk are acting like they own the<br/>list, and they dominate the colour of that list. The truth is no-one<br/>actually owns the list. A more self-transcending attitude can have<br/>miraculous consequences. (Try it first).</p><p>This list might go a similar way to the other if a few characters act like<br/>they own it, although there are some currently who are self-possessed<br/>sufficiently to act and express without the self affirming impulse that can<br/>often accompany it. What a good list needs is a group consciousness. I<br/>really think that we have everything to gain and nothing to lose by<br/>asserting our personal chronic (speaking for myself!) idiosyncracies.</p><p>An open question for Brian McLaren : Brian, why do you choose (and is it a<br/>conscious decision? - and if so what alternatives do you think there might<br/>be?) to confront individuals with force rather than merely set an example to<br/>those whom you consider on the right beam, of an encouraging nature? What do<br/>you think is achieved by forceful confrontation as opposed to either<br/>non-communication or encouraging spirit. I can see that you are firmly<br/>engaged in a tackling strategy in relation to those you feel are not doing<br/>micro-tonal composition or production in your book. I&apos;m curious to know<br/>what&apos;s behind the choice of this as a modus operandi when dealing with the<br/>characters on this list, each of whom represents a vast world of activity,<br/>knowledge and orientation that no one of us can possibly hope or claim to<br/>have even a large cognizance of. I hope you can feel respect for you in this<br/>question.</p><p>I feel that email discussion groups make it hard for busy folk to avoid the<br/>knee-jerk reaction syndrome, particularly when someone criticises them.<br/>Jacky Ligon&apos;s excellent idea with TMA seems to me to focus on more long<br/>lasting expression of our understandings and sharings. I don&apos;t post very<br/>often, because I&apos;m very involved with music creation, recording, composing,<br/>design and with teaching. I wonder whether we&apos;re ready to spend more time<br/>and focus on articles rather than be tempted to the more chatty<br/>interactions. It feels not currently. That&apos;s fine - don&apos;t get me wrong - if<br/>there&apos;s a need. It appeals less to me as time goes on. Its so easy to chew<br/>up time on spinning around.</p><p>I hope I havn&apos;t trodden on any temperaments or toes.<br/>Like Margo I feel the sense of community is paramount , even if I am a more<br/>selective poster than most. I value Margo&apos;s forthright espousal of a music<br/>of humanity (this is not a quote).</p><p>With infinite respect for all, especially the composers on the list<br/>best wishes indeed, and masses of inspiration and application to everyone<br/>Lawrence</p></div><h3><a id=697 href="#697">ðŸ”—</a>David J.
