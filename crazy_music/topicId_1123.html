Of course, real composers in the real world recognize<br/>&gt; that all of these tunings are simply heard as &quot;a whole buncha<br/>&gt; small intervals&quot; by listeners and practicing composers alike.<br/>&gt; Once you get past about 29 equal, hands-on experience composing<br/>&gt; in these equal temperaments shows that there&apos;s no significant<br/>&gt; audible musical difference between (say) 51 as opposed to 55 or<br/>&gt; 53, or 60 as opposed to 65.<br/>&gt;     Not many people have done anything with the full chromatic<br/>&gt; set of 55 equal, or for that matter other nearby chromatic sets<br/>&gt; like 60 equal or 65 equal. 72 has proven much more popular,<br/>&gt; probably since it&apos;s relatively easy to get 72 by rolling a bunch<br/>&gt; of harps next to one another (James Tenney) or pianos (Carrillo)<br/>&gt; etc.</p><p>I&apos;d like to quote this on my tunes page, to give interesting background<br/>to the tuning for visitors, if that is okay. As recorder player I<br/>have practiced Teleman pieces, so that link is of particular<br/>interest...</p><p>I&apos;ve been thinking about the way one composes in a n-tet, and<br/>how it influences one.</p><p>I think the inspiration is at a kind of subliminal level actually.<br/>The analytical mind isn&apos;t so good at picking up that kind of thing,<br/>if one asks what temperament a piece one hears is in, at least<br/>I&apos;m not good at that. But if one plays in it one gets affected<br/>all the same, my intuition says anyway, would be hard to do<br/>objective tests of it. Ditto if one composes.</p><p>Seems like the composition is inspired by the tuning.</p><p>Then idea I have is that one can have a tuning in 55-tet<br/>say, and by playing or composing, be inspired by it, and then having done<br/>that, if someone else plays it on, say, an acoustic instrument,<br/>then one would just say, play it pretty close to 12-tet,<br/>and follow the inspriation of the piece (which itself then derives<br/>from 55-tet originally). Then maybe performer would destabilise<br/>some of the fifths slightly naturally because of the way the<br/>chords are used - the context etc, and maybe play others a bit<br/>more pure, or vary the width of the thirds, and maybe it wouldn&apos;t<br/>exactly follow the way it happens in 55-tet, but it might follow<br/>the same inspiration.</p><p>I&apos;d say that a 12-tet realisation would also be okay if it worked<br/>- that would be the test, if the result sounded okay. Might or might<br/>not depending on timbre, and the way the piece works, and the<br/>tuning. But if it did, what one would have would be a 12-tet<br/>piece whose origins were inspired by, say, 55-tet.</p><p>Just as today we have many 12-tet pieces whose origins were<br/>perhaps inspired by the variety of flavours of keys that performenrs<br/>and composers were used to in C18 and C19 temperings. That too<br/>is okay I think.</p><p>&gt;    Robert Walker deserves praise for epxloring a relatively<br/>&gt; exotic tuning system. How about trying some of the more notable<br/>&gt; and beautiful but lesser-used equal divisions of the octave,<br/>&gt; Robert?  For example, 9 equal?  Or 15 equal?  Or 10 equal?  Or 21<br/>&gt; equal?</p><p>Thanks. I&apos;ll certainly explore other things, and try these<br/>particular ones too.</p><p>One idea I&apos;ve had from 55-tet is to use a tuning that can be in two exotic ets, and<br/>also their product which has a fairly conventional twelve tone<br/>scale. 55-tet suggest that idea as one could have sections in 5-tet<br/>and in 11-tet using subsets of the scale, and then also have<br/>sections in twelve tone. The 11-tet tones would be the large semitones<br/>of the 55-tet twelve tone scale, so that could be interesting.<br/>Just a thought, and not sure how it will work out.</p><p>&gt; ---------<br/>&gt;   One last issue -- LIME by Lipppold Haaken incorporates<br/>&gt; microtonal accidentals. WHen you pair the LIME notation program<br/>&gt; witht he FB-01, you get the ONLY *true* microtonal musical<br/>&gt; notation in existence. LIME will actually send microtonal pitches<br/>&gt; to the FB-01!<br/>&gt;   Why not try getting in touch with Lippold, Robert, and see if<br/>&gt; you can get him to hook your FTS into LIME in some way?<br/>&gt;   Shouldn&apos;t be that hard. And if you and Lippold can do that,<br/>&gt; you&apos;d have a truly awesome microtonal notation program *that*<br/>&gt; *actually* *sends* *microtonal* *pitches* *to* *the*<br/>&gt; *sythesizer*!!!</p><p>Okay I will do. Thanks very much for this suggestion.</p><p>Robert</p></div><h3><a id=1125 href="#1125">ðŸ”—</a>Robert Walker &#x3C;robertwalker@...&#x3E;</h3><span>10/6/2001 7:15:24 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>HI Brian,</p><p>I&apos;ve also had a nice idea for some subsets of 55-tet.</p><p>First of course, the meantone scale.</p><p>Then, a twelve tone scale consisiting of closest approx<br/>to 7-tet on the white notes, and exact 5-tet on the black.</p><p>The 7-tet would have six steps of 8 out of 55-tet,<br/>and one step of 7 out of 55.</p><p>So it would have three fairly pure fifths at the 55-tet<br/>fifth of 698.18 cents.</p><p>The 5-tet might perhaps start from the same 1/1 as the 7-tet<br/>in tradition of the pelog on white, slendro on black<br/>tunings of 12 tone keyboard (even though pelog isn&apos;t 7-tet).</p><p>Then have an 11-tet mode of some sort on the white notes.</p><p>Then do an improvisation, or a composed piece going through these.<br/>For the  12 t one, have four copies at shifts of a<br/>syntonic comma, so that one can play around with<br/>movement by syntonic comma too.</p><p>Just an idea of an idea at present,...</p><p>Robert</p></div>
