This kind of excursion led me to the<br/>progression that follows.</p><p>One &quot;odd&quot; interval in meantone that deserves more enthusiastic use is<br/>the &quot;Wolf fourth&quot; or augmented third, for example Eb-G#. Here&apos;s a<br/>cadence in which this interval sounds very pleasing and &quot;jazzy&quot; to me:</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/mnqwf001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/mnqwf001.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>In 1/4-comma meantone with pure 5:4 major thirds, the tuning for this<br/>example, the Wolf fourth has a size of ~462.36 cents, right around the<br/>zone of transition between a very large major third and a very small<br/>fourth, but sounding a bit more &quot;fourthlike&quot; to me. Here&apos;s the<br/>progression, with C4 as middle C:</p><p>Bb4 A4  G#4  A4<br/>F4  E4  Eb4  E4<br/>D4  C4  B4   A4</p><p>The active cadential sonority B4-Eb4-G#4 features a meantone<br/>diminished fourth at 32:25 (around 427.37 cents), in neo-Gothic terms<br/>a quite respectable major third which expands in the usual manner to a<br/>fifth.</p><p>Part of the fun with this kind of tuning is the possibility of<br/>shifting between a Renaissance style and a neo-Gothic style in the<br/>same piece, making use of the different intervals the scale has to<br/>offer.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/5/2001 5:40:19 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, everyone, and a special welcome to Brian McLaren, who now<br/>shares his extraordinary contributions in practice and theory with<br/>us.</p><p>Thank you especially for your very important point that the &quot;mood&quot; of<br/>a tuning is determined not only by the tuning&apos;s structure, but by the<br/>style of a given composition of improvisation. Your example of<br/>Debussy&apos;s Impressionistic approach to 12-tET really brings this point<br/>home.</p><p>Based on my own much more modest scope of practice and experience, I<br/>might add a few comments about certain tunings you mentioned, and<br/>offer an example of one of the &quot;moods&quot; of 22-tET.</p><p>For me, there are at least three main factors in this &quot;mood&quot; equation,<br/>all of which you mention:</p><p>                          tuning<br/>                          style<br/>                          timbre</p><p>For example, I have found that the question of whether 23-tET has<br/>anything like a &quot;perfect fifth&quot; is a very timbre-dependent question.<br/>In the right kind of timbre, I&apos;ve found that 13/23 octave or 678 cents<br/>can take part in a sonority of 0-678-1200 cents that sounds like a<br/>stable neo-Gothic concord to me.</p><p>With 17-tET, I would say that both style and timbre shape my feeling<br/>for the &quot;mood&quot; of this tuning. Since in a Gothic or neo-Gothic setting<br/>I _expect_ usual major and minor thirds to be complex and unstable,<br/>the main question is just _how_ complex or tense?</p><p>Here the way I would express things is to say that 6/17 octave or<br/>423.53 cents is a very _rich_ major third, and that downplaying the<br/>beats a bit allows me to relish the richness and the delightful<br/>expansion to a fifth, while finding the third itself _relatively_<br/>concordant, its stylistically proper role.</p><p>As I remarked in earlier posts here with musical examples, the neutral<br/>intervals of 17-tET have a &quot;mysterious&quot; or &quot;Impressionistic&quot; quality<br/>for me; there I focused especially on the neutral seventh or augmented<br/>sixth of 15/17 octave or about 1059 cents:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/99">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/99</a><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/105">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/105</a></p><p>The neutral thirds or sixths have a similar quality for me, and I hope<br/>soon to post on this with more examples.</p><p>Now we come to 22-tET, which I have found a very pleasant neo-Gothic<br/>tuning. Usual diatonic progressions and spellings are all there, but<br/>with some nice touches to make the mood a bit &quot;different.&quot;</p><p>One feature of 22-tET is that the regular major and minor thirds have<br/>sizes close to simple ratios of 9:7 and 7:6, so that a usual sonority<br/>like G3-B3-D4-E4 (with C4 as middle C) at about 0-436-702-927 cents is<br/>not too far from a JI tuning of 14:18:21:24. This expands very nicely<br/>to F3-C4-F4, with three strong interval resolutions (major sixth to<br/>octave, major third to fifth, and upper major second to fourth):</p><p>           E4   F4<br/>           D4   C4<br/>           B3   C4<br/>           G3   F3</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei002.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>The diatonic semitone at 1/22 octave or about 54.55 cents, actually a<br/>kind of &quot;diatonic quartertone,&quot; is something I find pleasant and<br/>recognizable without any problem, a point I was curious about when I<br/>first tuned this scale. I&apos;m fascinated by how melodic semitones of<br/>this size can sound convincing as regular diatonic steps, and how<br/>they&apos;ve become something I much treasure in various scales.</p><p>One neat touch of 22-tET gives what might be called a subtly different<br/>quality to another typical neo-Gothic progression:</p><p>          F4  E4  D4  C#4  D4<br/>          C4  B3  A3  G#3  A3<br/>          A3  G3  F3  E3   D3</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei001.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Here each upper voice outlines the descending melodic interval of a<br/>diminished fourth: F4-C#4 or C4-G#3. However, in 22-tET this interval<br/>actually has the size of a kind of large minor third, around 327.27<br/>cents! The result is a special kind of melodic flavor for this type of<br/>cadence.</p><p>One point I would make is that style can affect not only how one<br/>describes the &quot;mood&quot; of a tuning, but how one defines and spells its<br/>intervals. The spellings I routinely use for 17-tET and 22-tET, for<br/>example, fit at least my kind of neo-Gothic style; for a different<br/>style, a different spelling system might be much more convenient.</p><p>Again, these are only my own opinions, but the topic of tuning,<br/>timbre, and style has room for lots of views, and lots of creative<br/>comparing of notes.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/6/2001 6:13:11 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and here are a few random reflections on the<br/>&quot;xenharmonic bias&quot; of a scale, along with a curious MIDI example in<br/>17-tET.</p><p>While composers and theorists such as Ivor Darreg and Brian McLaren<br/>have spoken of the bias of a tuning &quot;toward melody&quot; or &quot;toward<br/>harmony,&quot; this raises an interesting question: &quot;_What kind_ of melody<br/>or harmony might be assumed here?&quot;</p><p>For example, if a microtonalist were to take the view that the seventh<br/>harmonic is an essential ingredient in &quot;good harmony,&quot; then any tuning<br/>without a close approximation of 7-based ratios would be &quot;biased<br/>toward melody.&quot; Someone taking a different approach to vertical or<br/>harmonic style might reach a very divergent conclusion.</p><p>A different approach might be to ask, &quot;What types of melodic or<br/>vertical style might this scale favor?&quot;</p><p>For example, 5-tET might have a melodic bias toward a style like that<br/>associated with the slendro scale of gamelan; while every gamelan has<br/>its own tuning, with lots of intonational nuances, 5-tET is a fairly<br/>close representation.</p><p>Vertically, 5-tET might be said to have a bias toward rather complex<br/>and shimmering fifths and fourths at 720 cents and 480 cents, also a<br/>feature of gamelan textures.</p><p>These aren&apos;t necessarily the only biases of 5-tET, just some obvious<br/>ones to illustrate the &quot;two-dimensional&quot; approach of looking both to<br/>melodic and vertical possibilities for any given tuning.</p><p>The fun of comparing notes and biases -- whether of the scales, or of<br/>the xenharmonicists &lt;grin&gt; -- might get especially exciting with a<br/>tuning like 17-tET.</p><p>If we&apos;re looking at Western European compositional styles, for<br/>example, then 17-tET with its fifths and fourths quite close to pure<br/>and its very active regular thirds and sixths seems to have a bias<br/>toward quintal/quartal harmony (medieval or 20th-century).</p><p>The contrast between the large whole-tones at 3/17 octave (~211.76<br/>cents) and the small diatonic semitones or thirdtones at 1/17 octave<br/>(~70.59 cents) suggests a bias toward brilliant diatonic melody.</p><p>This isn&apos;t exactly the latest news: Ivor Darreg was writing about<br/>17-tET in more or less these terms two decades or more ago. However,<br/>we now run into an interesting question: what kind of timbre do we<br/>want?</p><p>A neo-Gothic microtonalist might say, &quot;Let&apos;s Sethareanize a bit to<br/>make those active thirds a bit more blending, or less &apos;dissonant,&apos; so<br/>that they can sound like partial or imperfect concords. They should be<br/>intriguing and unstable, but also relatively euphonious.&quot;</p><p>A &quot;modernist&quot; familiar with Darreg and McLaren, however, might<br/>suggest, &quot;Why not let those major thirds serve as outright discords,<br/>resolving down to seconds? -- we can rewrite the historical rules for<br/>15th-19th century suspensions, and have the third resolve down to the<br/>second instead of the fourth to the third.&quot;</p><p>The result might be something like this:</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/17tet008.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/17tet008.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>Then, again, a style treating the neutral thirds of 17-tET as primary<br/>concords might be said to have a &quot;nontraditional tertian or triadic<br/>bias.&quot; Here&apos;s an open question: what kind of melodic bias why this<br/>type of style invite?</p><p>Yet again, if we use a pentatonic melodic style with fifths and<br/>fourths as the main concords, that&apos;s another kind of melodic bias<br/>nicely mixing with a vertical &quot;quintal/quartal&quot; bias.</p><p>A possible conclusion: take one tuning plus two xenharmonicists,<br/>and you&apos;re likely to get at least three biases.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2001 8:33:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, George Zelenz, and thank you for sharing with us an<br/>experience which moves me to send the most benevolent wishes for a<br/>full healing of hand and spirit, along with a bit of music.</p><p>Here&apos;s an opening sketch for a piece in 20-tET I call &quot;Stern-Brocot<br/>Treehouse,&quot; maybe something with a calm kind of energy sort of swaying<br/>in the breeze:</p><p>MIDI example: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/20tgz002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/20tgz002.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>You&apos;ve shared with us a moment of hurt, pain, and vulnerability,<br/>something for all of us to reflect on, and to honor your trust in<br/>making us a part of the healing process.</p><p>In friendship,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>George Zelenz &#x3C;ploo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/8/2001 10:09:40 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Margo!</p><p>Wow.</p><p>I&apos;m so touched, i&apos;ll say it backwards. woW.</p><p>I am so very honored to be gifted with your music.</p><p>Presciently, you&apos;ve created a mood i&apos;m familiar with.

It&apos;s your historical writing and documentation that made me<br/>aware of this, and frequent reminders about such foundations for<br/>&quot;Sethereanizing&quot; place the achievements of Bill Sethares in a richer<br/>perspective.</p><p>For the kind of neo-Gothic or Xeno-Renaissance music I play, Setharean<br/>timbres can have a truly revolutionary effect. Of course, with other<br/>styles including later European ones, your mileage -- or kilometrage --<br/>may vary.</p><p>For example, last night I tried a certain mixture of timbres with<br/>23-tET, and found the effect with a 14th-century style at once<br/>eccentric, offbeat, zany, and somehow at some level an ultimate<br/>refinement of fashion. I&apos;d almost call it a kind of &quot;intonational<br/>syncopation,&quot; like the rhythmic intricacies of the period.</p><p>It was a wild interpretation, with lots of zing and zonk. The fifths,<br/>fourths, and cadences were recognizable -- and exhilarating, in an<br/>&quot;over the top&quot; kind of way.</p><p>I also tried a familiar three-voice Italian piece in what seems to be<br/>a 13th-century style, and found it quite recognizable, also.</p><p>Possibly the style of Gothic or neo-Gothic music, with an exuberant<br/>contrast between stable and unstable sonorities, takes more kindly to<br/>Setharean &quot;bending&quot; than some other kinds of music -- anyway, I call<br/>it a revolution, at least for me.</p><p>While Renaissance music has a very different and more delicate<br/>approach to concord/discord, I&apos;ve found that under certain conditions,<br/>Sethareanized fifths well outside the range of 680-720 cents can serve<br/>both as vertical intervals and as direct melodic intervals. While<br/>directed medieval progressions most typically favor stepwise or<br/>thirdwise motion in all voices, Renaissance music typically mixes bass<br/>motions by seconds, thirds, fourths, and fifths.</p><p>Here I&apos;d want to emphasize that medieval and Renaissance styles are in<br/>many ways radically contrasting, as are the standard tuning systems of<br/>medieval Pythagorean and Renaissance meantone.</p><p>What the two kinds of music may have in common is an often fluid and<br/>flexible sense of modality, in contrast to the tonality of the 18th<br/>and 19th centuries. Might this fluidity permit more Setharean &quot;leeway&quot;<br/>in the stretching or compressing of intervals, as long as sensory<br/>&quot;consonance&quot; or smoothness is maintained?</p><p>For example, I find a usual Renaissance semitone of around 117-120<br/>cents in a typical meantone tuning as quite normal, although many<br/>listeners are reported to find it too large or &quot;dull,&quot; and composers<br/>such as Darreg have specifically urged the use of a narrower cadential<br/>semitone. Is it possible that 16th-century modality with its &quot;pastel&quot;<br/>colors and delicate shades invites large semitones, but that people<br/>accustomed to later styles like them smaller?</p><p>At the other extreme, I find a diatonic semitone of 54.55 cents in<br/>22-tET quite normal, also, for neo-Gothic music -- note that this is<br/>only one interpretation of semitones in that scale, of course.</p><p>Maybe one conclusion might be that I&apos;m not only on the cutting edge of<br/>&quot;Sethareanizing,&quot; but I&apos;ve gone _off_ the edge, and should enjoy the<br/>music now that I&apos;m there, but not necessarily expect anyone else to<br/>share my taste &lt;grin&gt;.</p><p>Anyway, now that I&apos;ve maybe learned how to solve a minor technical<br/>glitch with making a tape of some of this music, I look forward to<br/>sharing &quot;Sethareanization&quot; in action -- with lots of gratitude to<br/>Pierce, Darreg, Carlos, McLaren, and all the others who have<br/>contributed to this fascinating dance of tuning, timbre, and style.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>Jon Szanto &#x3C;JSZANTO@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2001 11:34:06 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Ms. Margo,</p><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Anyway, now that I&apos;ve maybe learned how to solve a minor technical<br/>&gt; glitch with making a tape of some of this music, I look forward to<br/>&gt; sharing &quot;Sethareanization&quot; in action...</p><p>I&apos;m not sure where you are at, with your mention of &quot;glitch&quot;, but if<br/>you are able to get a piece onto tape (but no further) I would be<br/>more than happy to digitize it and encode it to mp3 like all the<br/>other kids around here do, and upload it for you.

When Maddalena Casulana pubilshed her first madrigal collection<br/>in 1566, she dedicated it to Isabella de&apos; Medici, a musician and<br/>likely also a composer -- but here the roles are reversed, for you are<br/>the established composer and I the one who seeks to follow your<br/>example.</p><p>The scale is what I call Pythagorean enharmonic, with two 12-note<br/>Pythagorean tunings a 459:448 apart, about 41.99 cents.</p><p>Brian, when I saw your call for a JI quartertone piece, I realized<br/>that this might be just the tuning for it; and Monz, I couldn&apos;t resist<br/>also the chance to share another possible keyboard model for something<br/>that just might approximate the scheme of our beloved Marchettus.</p><p>My original idea for this 24-note system was to combine a basic<br/>Pythagorean tuning with pure sonorities at 14:17:21 (around 0-336-702<br/>cents), what I&apos;d call a division of the pure fifth into &quot;supraminor&quot;<br/>and &quot;submajor&quot; thirds at 17:14 and 21:17.</p><p>Additionally, Monz, this tuning happens to feature a division of the<br/>regular Pythagorean diatonic semitone or limma at 256:243 or around 90<br/>cents into the 42-cent diesis between the keyboards, plus a neat<br/>48-cent &quot;quartertone&quot; more precisely at 114688:111537 (~48.23 cents).</p><p>Both you and Jay Rahn have proposed that at least some of the dieses<br/>of Marchettus had a monochord size of 37:36 (~47.43 cents), or almost<br/>the same size.</p><p>Please let me explain that while my &quot;17-flavor&quot; sonorities seem to be<br/>a feature of _neo_-Gothic music rather than known medieval practice or<br/>theory, the use of extra-narrow cadential &quot;dieses&quot; and extra-wide<br/>major thirds before fifths and major sixths before octaves is how many<br/>people including Rahn and I read Marchettus himself.</p><p>The opening and closing three-note progressions in this piece have the<br/>outer two voices borrowed from examples in Marchettus. For example,<br/>here&apos;s the final cadence, with C4 as middle C, and an asterisk (*)<br/>showing a note on the upper keyboard raised by a 42-cent diesis:</p><p>C#*4  D4<br/>G#*3  A3<br/>E3    D3</p><p>Here the upper voices ascend by 48-cent &quot;quartertones,&quot; with the<br/>cadential major third and sixth at about 450 cents and 948 cents --<br/>the rounded values suggested by Rahn.</p><p>A related kind of cadence not described by Marchettus uses 48-cent<br/>quartertones in descending motion, with an extra narrow minor third<br/>and minor seventh at around 252 cents and 954 cents contracting<br/>respectively to a unison and fifth:</p><p>F4   E*4<br/>Bb3  A*3<br/>G*3  A*3</p><p>There&apos;s also a very nice &quot;2/3-tone&quot; at 68:53 (~132.20 cents) that<br/>occurs in this piece in a &quot;17-flavor&quot; progression where a pure<br/>14:17:21 sonority resolves with the 17:14 supraminor third contracting<br/>to a unison and the 21:17 submajor third expanding to a fifth:</p><p>C#4  D*4<br/>A*3  G*3<br/>F#3  G*3</p><p>By the way, Brian, this tuning has some extra goodies that especially<br/>remind me of you. By adding a 42-cent diesis to a Pythagorean<br/>augmented second or schisma minor third at 19683:16384, we get<br/>intervals in three positions of 9034497:7340032 or about 359.59 cents,<br/>only differing by about 0.12 cents from another interval you&apos;ve<br/>mentioned recently, 16:13 (about 359.47 cents). An example would be<br/>F4-G#*4 or Bb4-C#*5.</p><p>Anyway, enough math for the moment -- but congratulations, Brian, on<br/>that JI tuning with 19 pure 5:4 thirds, something that wouldn&apos;t have<br/>occurred to me, and your 19-tET comparison is really neat. It&apos;s<br/>amazing all the ways out there to pet a cat and get those ratios<br/>purring, so to speak.</p><p>Thank you Mary, Brian, Marchettus, and Monz, among others, for your<br/>ideas, inspirations -- and the opportunity to share with you in a<br/>common community.</p><p>Above all, I want to say through this piece what peace activist<br/>Barbara Deming has said: &quot;We are all part of one another.&quot;</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2001 9:23:34 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and I&apos;d like at least to offer a prompt<br/>correct correction both to the post I sent a few minutes ago, and to<br/>the title of my composition:</p><p>    &quot;Salutation for Mary Beth Ackerley, envision&apos;d as Lysistrata&quot;</p><p>How strange that I checked a CD of your music today to confirm the<br/>spelling of your name -- but that somehow I still got it wrong, and<br/>realized this immediately after posting.</p><p>Curiously, I find on checking that I spelled your name correctly in my<br/>crude &quot;score&quot; -- the Scala MIDI definition file.</p><p>Maybe compositional excitement, concern over events here, and a bit of<br/>tiredness contributed to this most embarrassing mistake for me; but<br/>then, knowledge of one&apos;s own fallibility and its sometimes humorous<br/>aspects can be an important ingredient for peace, inner or communal.</p><p>Most apologetically, with deepest appreciation,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2001 10:59:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Dear George Zelenz, thank you so much for your generous and moving<br/>words in response to my sketch for the opening of &quot;Stern-Brocot<br/>Treehouse,&quot; prompting me in reply to send more healing encouragement.</p><p>Thank you also, Graham Breed, for your response, to Brian McLaren for<br/>much appreciative incitement to new music, and to Joe Monzo for<br/>mentioning a choral piece I much look forward to hearing, maybe on<br/>cassette or CD.</p><p>This kind of generosity is all the more reason why I need to find out<br/>where the rest of &quot;Stern-Brocot Treehouse&quot; is going, something I may<br/>learn through some more improvisation.</p><p>There are lots more messages to answer and thanks to share, but at<br/>least this is a start.</p><p>Most appreciatively,</p><p>Margo Schulter<br/>mschulter@...</p></div><h3>nanom3@...</h3><span>7/11/2001 7:07:53 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &quot;Salutation for Mary Beth Ackerley, envision&apos;d as Lysistrata&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&apos;m traveling and have have stolen five minutes here on a 28k<br/>laptop I share with my partner who is getting ready for tomorrows<br/>trades.

Women ranging from Fannie Lou Hamer in<br/>Mississippi, USA, to Leyla Zana in Kurdistan have endured violence and<br/>risked their lives in order to resist such behavior without emulating<br/>it.</p><p>Cordially but passionately dissenting from some views expressed here,<br/>I&apos;d like to suggest that &quot;spanking a bully&quot; can be viewed as itself a<br/>kind of &quot;bullying behavior,&quot; because it involves physical violence<br/>against a subdued person, exactly what we want to stop rather than to<br/>emulate. If you reword that: &quot;Bullying behavior tends to go on until<br/>it is resisted and restrained,&quot; then I have no problem.</p><p>Normally I would tend to post about these things in some newsgroup or<br/>other discussion forum on creative nonviolence or the like rather than<br/>this one, which is mainly about making &quot;crazy_music&quot; and maybe<br/>philosophizing a bit about one&apos;s methods or theoretical outlook in<br/>doing so. (Yes, I regard myself as a theorist.)</p><p>What I&apos;d like to suggest are some possible approaches to civility<br/>which may be at once &quot;pro-crazy_music&quot; and &quot;anti-bullying.&quot; The idea,<br/>as I see it, is to keep focused on sustaining each other&apos;s music<br/>making, and celebrating our positive worldviews behind or shaped by<br/>the music.</p><p>         1. ERV WILSON&apos;S ADVICE: &quot;Talk about what you&apos;re doing, not<br/>            about what you&apos;re not doing.&quot;</p><p>         2. FOCUS ON OUR MUSIC. While any strict or rigid rule would<br/>            be counterproductive, I try to keep theoretical comments<br/>            focused mainly on what I&apos;m doing, or at least on what<br/>            I&apos;m planning on doing -- or what might be helpful feedback<br/>            or background for what someone else is doing or plans on<br/>            doing.</p><p>         3. RECOGNIZE ROOM FOR DIVERSITY AND DIFFERENCES. As it<br/>            happens, I find 20th-century pantonal music such as<br/>            Schoenberg&apos;s or Berg&apos;s easier listening than some<br/>            19th-century European music -- and if 99.9% of the<br/>            people in some psychoacoustical survey show different<br/>            tastes, that doesn&apos;t bother me.</p><p>         4. CELEBRATE OUR KOOKINESS. As a self-proclaimed devotee<br/>            of the high art of microkookality, I take the view that<br/>            to compose, improvise, or celebrate unconventional<br/>            music is to be a &quot;kook,&quot; and I&apos;m out to make the most<br/>            of it. After all, it&apos;s called &quot;crazy_music.&quot;</p><p>         5. BOYCOTT BULLYING BEHAVIOR. In a forum like this, one<br/>            effective method for resisting verbal assault without<br/>            emulating it is the boycott: not responding, but<br/>            continuing with our positive musical lives online<br/>            and offline.</p><p>Finally, since I suspect that we may share many musical discoveries<br/>here that may contradict or at least qualify the opinions of some<br/>great musicians and theorists, I might suggest as a model the words of<br/>Albert Einstein:</p><p>              &quot;Newton, forgive me.

Other traditions such as Tibetan Buddhism also draw such a<br/>parallel between universal macrocosm and human microcosm.</p><p>With Mary&apos;s music, as with much beautiful music of 14th-century<br/>Europe, for example, a sophisticated mathematical and philosophical<br/>basis doesn&apos;t exclude passionate feeling and intimate communication,<br/>but can guide it in certain directions.</p><p>Here I will attempt to share my impressions of some of these<br/>directions, however imperfectly, and to suggest some possible<br/>connections -- connections drawn in the eye of the beholder, or the<br/>ear of the listener, like ecumenical difference tones.</p><p>                                   I</p><p>In 1558, the great Italian theorist Gioseffo Zarlino compared a<br/>composer&apos;s apprenticeship to that of a physician, with practical<br/>experience the key to true expertise. Mary seems to take this metaphor<br/>a step further: her microtunings relate to &quot;different aspects of the<br/>body&apos;s education.&quot; Her purpose is &quot;Evolutionary music that moves<br/>bodies and heals souls...&quot;</p><p>Such a purpose is common to various spiritual traditions: consider,<br/>for example, manifestations ranging from the sacred music of Tibet to<br/>the music and dancing of Miriam, David, and Judith in the Hebrew<br/>tradition.</p><p>However, Mary&apos;s message is not only one of peace and healing, but of<br/>power, sometimes awesome power. People familiar with a range of<br/>microtonal musics have described some of her pieces as eerie or even<br/>scary, although I might prefer to say &quot;subterranean.&quot;</p><p>I must admit that I was somewhat daunted when first reading an<br/>&quot;Advisory&quot; notice appearing on the back of her CD cover:</p><p>           &quot;ADVISORY: Warning! This music will penetrate<br/>            deeply held belief systems</p><p>           &quot;Listen only if you are willing to release<br/>            social consciousness.&quot;</p><p>Upon consideration, I concluded that my best response would be to<br/>listen in an ecumenical spirit (both theological and musical),<br/>affirming my own tradition and vows while honoring and respecting the<br/>spirituality and sacred creativity of a precious sister.</p><p>At the same time, I realized that my musical impressions might be<br/>profoundly influenced not only by my cultural and spiritual<br/>perspectives, but by a factor possibly of interest to Mary from her<br/>viewpoint as a medical doctor: the state of my hearing and its<br/>psychological ramifications.</p><p>For the past 21 months, I have experienced constant tinnitus in my<br/>right ear -- literally a &quot;ringing,&quot; but actually for the most part,<br/>fortunately, mainly just a quiet kind of background &quot;white noise.&quot;<br/>Happily, I&apos;m often quite unaware of it unless I happen to focus on it.</p><p>While it&apos;s well to take this opportunity to caution that tinnitus is<br/>often associated with exposure to excessive sound levels -- musical or<br/>otherwise -- in my case the constant tinnitus started after a minor<br/>accident I had when I tried to move a box fan from a window very early<br/>in the morning, and it hit the right side of my head above the ear.</p><p>Fifteen years earlier, in 1983, I had been mugged in San Francisco,<br/>and was struck in the same area, with tinnitus persisting a few weeks<br/>and then going away, although occasionally returning. I can only guess<br/>that the fan incident, itself a minor injury, may have aggravated an<br/>earlier problem.</p><p>Anyway, an audiology exam revealed (as I had noticed after the<br/>accident) some mild high frequency hearing loss in my right ear. Last<br/>fall I was tested again, and the good news was no significant change.</p><p>However, it&apos;s not the tinnitus or the mild high frequency hearing loss<br/>that&apos;s the most difficult part: it&apos;s something that hasn&apos;t yet in my<br/>case been officially diagnosed, but might possibly be described as<br/>some kind of &quot;recruitment&quot; or very mild &quot;hyperacusis,&quot; coupled with<br/>what&apos;s known as &quot;phonophobia,&quot; or fear of intense sound levels.</p><p>Whatever the correct diagnosis, what it means is that I become<br/>uncomfortable around everyday noises that I took for granted two years<br/>ago, and avoid most public meetings or concerts where any kind of<br/>sound amplification is involved in which I don&apos;t have control over the<br/>volume. Sadly, this includes microtonal or early music events,<br/>including local ones where generous people have made transportation<br/>very easily available.</p><p>While prudence might suggest that I&apos;m not so overcautious to use ear<br/>plugs or protective ear muffs, for example, when leaf blowers are<br/>being run outside my apartment, the question is how far to carry this.<br/>The balance between real hearing conservation concerns and nervousness<br/>about any moderately loud sound can be a delicate one. Defining and<br/>nurturing a safe space between &quot;inaudible&quot; and &quot;threatening&quot; is a<br/>psychological imperative.</p><p>Maybe my mild aural imperfections, however trivial compared to more<br/>serious hearing loss problems not to speak of other medical and human<br/>complications endured in a world filled with violence and poverty, can<br/>at least defuse one topic of musical polemics.</p><p>To me, the idea of a &quot;defective ear&quot; is not an insult or a putdown:<br/>it&apos;s a simple medical fact. Sometimes I wonder: has my accident<br/>somehow channeled my musical experiences in directions different from<br/>those they might otherwise have taken? Was this a gift of a very<br/>special and unpredictable kind?</p><p>Whatever the answers, I must explain the impact in listening to a CD<br/>such as _Intervals of Motion_, or indeed any CD with large dynamic<br/>contrasts of a kind also found, for example, in European classical<br/>music of the 18th century (where _pianoforte_ describes a very<br/>relevant characteristic of the instrument in question).</p><p>Confronted by music mixing loud and soft dynamic levels in a sometimes<br/>unpredictable way, I have a simple response: turn down the volume to a<br/>level that feels safe for the highest actual or anticipated level.</p><p>With Mary&apos;s music, I started with the volume at 18, and found myself<br/>adjusting it downward to 12, then to 8, and eventually to 6. This<br/>reflects mainly my own distorted sense of sound intensity, and<br/>suggests to me that my caution caused me likely to miss at least the<br/>fine points of many quieter sections.</p><p>Although with a beautiful piece such as &quot;Phi harmonics&quot; (#15) there is<br/>for me the solution of confirming that the sound level is very<br/>moderate through the piece, and then going back and hearing it again<br/>at a higher volume, my literally defective ear is a factor which can<br/>and should be disclosed in this kind of review.</p><p>Please let me add the commonsense advice for more typical listeners<br/>that with this or any other recording, you should adjust the volume as<br/>appropriate in a safe and sane way to promote aural health as well as<br/>listening enjoyment.</p><p>                                  II</p><p>The opening piece &quot;Perception of Veils&quot; started with what I found a<br/>&quot;spacy&quot; quality, maybe a bit like the music from a science fiction<br/>film of the 1950&apos;s; the music seemed now a bit efforvescent, now<br/>lower, and now again &quot;bubbling.&quot;</p><p>Maybe this association with science fiction or horror genres of my<br/>childhood is part of what makes people describe Mary&apos;s music as<br/>&quot;scary,&quot; but her evident purpose is not to terrify but to enlighten.<br/>Thus the Tibetan tradition speaks of &quot;Wrathful Deities&quot; -- reflecting<br/>aspects of the observer&apos;s consciousness on the path toward love --<br/>while Christian mystics such as St. John of the Cross speak of a &quot;Dark<br/>Night of the Soul.&quot;</p><p>The second piece, &quot;Flow,&quot; also enters this territory: it seems for a<br/>moment to a sound a vertical fifth, an interval for me representing<br/>the quintessence of consonance and spaciousness, then moving through<br/>space, and becoming more low and brooding.</p><p>As moods, timbres, and possible allusions to various world musics come<br/>and go in rapid succession, the result is a curious kind of flow of<br/>global scope, at once encompassing many traditions and communicating a<br/>meditative style of its own.</p><p>The third piece, &quot;Dead Zone Blues,&quot; mixes high and low sounds with a<br/>sense of tension: I was reminded at one moment of a Tibetan sacred<br/>orchestra, or possibly an Indian raga, followed by a kind of<br/>&quot;high-tech&quot; string timbre mixed with high sounds.</p><p>The next piece, &quot;Harmony of Center,&quot; had a gliding-up kind of feeling,<br/>with a bit of &quot;sliding&quot;; at the conclusion, I wrote, a &quot;very<br/>penetrating sound.&quot;</p><p>With all this diversity, there is also a subtle mathematical and<br/>intonational unity based on what Mary describes as the &quot;Lambdoma<br/>Matrix of Pythagoras.&quot; Apparently quite different than the kind of<br/>tuning by pure fifths often termed &quot;Pythagorean,&quot; this system is based<br/>on what she neatly terms a series of &quot;wavelength ratios&quot; taking the<br/>form 1/n, also known as a &quot;subharmonic series.&quot;</p><p>In the booklet accompanying the CD, there is a multicolor chart of<br/>these subharmonics through five octaves, and their relationship to<br/>different pieces on the CD. The booklet also gives a URL for the<br/>complete chart: &lt;<a href="http://www.elucida.com/harmonics3.html">http://www.elucida.com/harmonics3.html</a>&gt;.</p><p>Looking at this chart in the booklet version, which reminds me maybe a<br/>bit of a periodic table of the elements, I reflect on the statement of<br/>St. Thomas Aquinas that &quot;whatever is received is received according to<br/>the mode of the receiver.&quot;</p><p>While St. Thomas was making the point that in the process of human<br/>development, the intellect is informed by the impressions of the<br/>senses, his statement suggests to me also the ways in which spiritual<br/>experience may draw upon cultural forms and images for its expression.<br/>Mary&apos;s chart, like a Tibetan mandala or the iconography of a Gothic<br/>cathedral, expresses a spiritual message of love in the language of a<br/>given cultural setting.</p><p>At times, the interactions between the composer and the receiver of<br/>the music -- the listener -- can take on joyously unpredictable<br/>patterns. For example, with &quot;Joy Spark&quot; (#8), I experienced a moment<br/>of Monteverdi, remembering a telling suspension discord in the opening<br/>madrigal of his Book IV (1603).</p><p>In &quot;Spacious&quot; (#10) I felt a &quot;curious reverberation, or resonances,&quot;<br/>with an effect &quot;a bit like Tibetan chanting,&quot; almost a kind of<br/>conversation between voices in some unfamiliar language. This<br/>impression reminded me of the Tibetan practice of in fact distorting<br/>the syllables of certain texts for the compassionate purpose of<br/>protecting listeners not prepared to negotiate their perilous wisdom.</p><p>In &quot;Abundance Symphony&quot; (#12), I heard percussion and a melodic theme,<br/>whose pleasing qualities I noted, with a moment recalling for me a<br/>great composer and theorist of the 20th century, Schoenberg. One side<br/>of Mary&apos;s music, like Schoenberg&apos;s, is a kind of creative chaos, at<br/>once recognizing the ominous or apparently random qualities of the<br/>modern world, and making this chaos part of an ordered musical<br/>universe.</p><p>One luminous piece definitely among my favorites is &quot;Phi Harmonics&quot;<br/>(#15), with a spacious and floating feeling, based as Mary explains<br/>on Phi, the &quot;Golden Ratio&quot; of around 0.618 or 1.618 derived from the<br/>Fibonacci series, and also the square of the second form of this ratio<br/>at around 2.618.</p><p>Another lyric moment is &quot;Joy&quot; (#17) with a melody and an impression of<br/>vertical fifths or fourths which reminded me of one of my favorite<br/>instruments, the mouth organ called a _khene_ in Laos and a _sheng_ in<br/>China.</p><p>The closing two pieces incorporate a kind of vocal music very familiar<br/>to me, Gregorian chant.</p><p>&quot;The Missing Gene&quot; (#18) may reflect Mary&apos;s fascination with the human<br/>genome as a basis for music, as well as a part of a larger reality.<br/>Her chart in the CD booklet, for example, identifies one wavelength<br/>ratio in &quot;Octave 3&quot; (n/53, if I read correctly): &quot;Stimulates the<br/>transference of information from galactic center to energetic light<br/>channel on DNA.&quot;</p><p>This piece has a lyric quality, with moments about two minutes into<br/>the music with enticing fifths and fourths.</p><p>The final piece, &quot;PostAtomic Light&quot; (#19), has a floating feeling with<br/>voices, chanting, stringlike timbres, and percussion.</p><p>Quite apart from my known aural idiosyncrasies, I would caution that<br/>simply by attempting to write a review of this music, I may have been<br/>placing myself in a frame of mind rather different than that of an<br/>ideal listener. Inevitably, in attempting to verbalize my experience,<br/>I must describe and categorize rather than simply abandon myself to<br/>the total experience.</p><p>What I can say is that Mary is an artist who draws on many sources and<br/>traditions to share her spiritual vision and express her message of<br/>transformation. The diverse places and cultures which have shaped her<br/>life also interact in her music.</p><p>While microtunings play a central role in this music, they are one<br/>part of a whole which might be described as protean, flowing,<br/>shifting, sometimes looming or even ominous, and sometimes placidly<br/>luminous and lyric.</p><p>Although I hope that most listeners won&apos;t have to deal with the<br/>personal aural complications that I do, I would invite each to find<br/>her or his own sense of beauty and awe in this music.</p><p>Mary Beth Ackerley, M.D.<br/>_Intervals of Motion_<br/>Galaxia Studios (1998)<br/>P.O.

Perhaps that is the gift of this physical shortcoming</p><p>&gt; A medical doctor as well as a composer, Mary expresses what I might<br/>&gt; call in my own medieval European tradition _Musica humana_, the<br/>&gt; concept of the human body and soul as the expression of a divine<br/>&gt; harmony and also as the mirror of a cosmic harmony or _Musica<br/>&gt; mundana_. Other traditions such as Tibetan Buddhism also draw such a<br/>&gt; parallel between universal macrocosm and human microcosm.</p><p>May I quote this?  I really appreciate the most beautiful way in<br/>which you have expressed something which just seems intuitive to<br/>me , &quot;as above, so below&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/> &gt; Maybe this association with science fiction or horror genres of my<br/>&gt; childhood is part of what makes people describe Mary&apos;s music as<br/>&gt; &quot;scary,&quot; but her evident purpose is not to terrify but to enlighten.<br/>&gt; Thus the Tibetan tradition speaks of &quot;Wrathful Deities&quot; --</p><p>Thank you Margo.  Again this is incredibly insightful of you.  The<br/>wrathful deity is that which clears so that new growth can come<br/>about, like a forest fire.  And in my music there is an overriding<br/>desire, beyond entertainment, to clear old psychic wounds and<br/>baggage, first my own, and then anyone else who is willing to let go<br/>and move forward.  One of the most profound mysteries to me in human<br/>psychology is how to get beyond denial and blindness.  How can you<br/>possibly change something you cannot see in your behavior(and usually<br/>something which is quite obvious to others).  So much of human<br/>interchange is run from what I call &quot;dead&quot; thoughts -  perceptions<br/>and filters formed by a young child&apos;s reaction to trauma it could not<br/>control, or by resentments, angers and wounds never resolved and<br/>continually recreated in each new encounter.</p><p>To be fully present in the moment is the state of the fool and<br/>radical innocence, and is I think the best place to be for creating a<br/>life (our most profound composition) that is enjoyed and savored, not<br/>endured.</p><p>I have found for myself again and again that the more I can see &quot;my<br/>stuff&quot; and let go of it (almost more difficult than seeing it) the<br/>more I really enjoy being alive. And in my music I am always looking<br/>for ways to make this process easier, faster, and more efficient.</p><p>I am no saint and this is all a process. But I have found that many<br/>perceive this willingness to clear and release as terrifying,<br/>although I tend to find it exhilerating :-)</p><p>Anyway I am going to get to go practice these wonderful words on<br/>moving day 2 , 108 degree heat, already irritated partner.  I kinda<br/>doubt i&apos;m gonna get beyond endurance today.....</p><p>So must end but thank you again very much for you willingness to<br/>enter the journey also.  (and I very much like the midi clip you<br/>dedicated to me. When I have a chance i would like to remix it in<br/>Reaktor and Virus and see where it goes with a thoroughly electronic<br/>whine)</p><p>Peace,<br/>Mary</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/16/2001 9:15:58 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, Mary, and everyone.</p><p>First, Mary, thanks for your most gracious words about my review, and<br/>please feel free to quote anything there.

There<br/>appears to be an opposing system of belief that people<br/>are lazy and stupid and thus the only way people can be<br/>motivated to do their work is by threats and<br/>intimidation. This theory was soundly debunked tnhrough<br/>extensive research, which is summarized in the<br/>excellent 1963 book &quot;Motivation and Productivity&quot; by<br/>Saul. W. Gellerman.</p><p>That has not stopped people, particularly those who see<br/>themselves in the roles of managers or leaders, from<br/>using these tactics, which tend to always spell doom<br/>for the group and resentment among those subjected to<br/>them. As an example, we have just come off an enormous<br/>tech boom characterized by outlandish work hours,<br/>demeaning and dangerous work conditions, and bullying<br/>and intimidation by bosses who ran their best engineers<br/>like they were running a sweatshop. The result?<br/>Exhausted, dismotivated people, extremely poor, perhaps<br/>psychotic decisions being made, enormous turnover and<br/>undelivered, sabotaged, or completely unusable<br/>products. And yet there was enormous potential to<br/>succeed and a will to do so, and general positive<br/>outlook and enthusiasm to begin with. Even a very very<br/>poor manager should have been able to put these things<br/>together to create success, but we are talking about<br/>instead a complete and total incompetance regarding the<br/>ability to motivate others, coupled with an uncanny<br/>genius at demotivational techniques, being pandemic in<br/>the industry.</p><p>&gt; Secondly, if our focus is on creation, should not our threads<br/>&gt; reflect this focus both by ** placing new music in the<br/>&gt; forefront **, and ** by celebrating our positive goals and<br/>&gt; values, however diverse or even sometimes amicably dissonant?<br/>&gt; **</p><p>Margo, this is self-evident to myself and many others.<br/>And it has historically yielded positive, repeatable<br/>results that are maintainable over time, especially<br/>when used with creative, intelligent and/or highly<br/>skilled citizens.</p><p>&gt; Third, if we feel that a focus on musical creation and mutual<br/>&gt; friendship and support is the main theme of this group, then<br/>&gt; might we use our discretion so as to respond to those<br/>&gt; messages and threads which promote this theme and sustain our<br/>&gt; community?</p><p>This makes sense to me and is of course the free choice<br/>of each person to choose or reject. Not just here in<br/>this group, but throughout life! Always ask &quot;what do I<br/>hope to accomplish by taking the action I am about to<br/>undertake&quot;. Many people will also try to understand us<br/>by asking the same question.</p><p>&gt;           To post to crazy_music is an open invitation;<br/>&gt;           To respond is each user&apos;s sovereign choice.</p><p>Correct.</p><p>&gt; Might I suggest that the purpose of our group be fostered by<br/>&gt; our free and communal consensus to reply to messages and<br/>&gt; threads which serve two purposes:</p><p>&gt; 1. &quot;Keeping it real,&quot; closely related to creating music;</p><p>Yes, that is exactly the meaning.</p><p>&gt; 2. &quot;Keeping it friendly,&quot; building trust and community.</p><p>Well, I suppose the system can handle a little bit of<br/>turf wars or such. It&apos;s when they get personal that<br/>damage is done. I like the idea of a &apos;vicious war&apos;<br/>being conducted between competing composers with music<br/>their only weapon that scores points!! Others may<br/>choose to cooperate with each other. Spectators can<br/>cheer or boo and take votes to determine thumbs up or<br/>thumbs down. Not in every case, but when challenging<br/>music is brought out, such as Chris&apos; excellent<br/>composition which put to rest the concerns many of us<br/>had about John&apos;s algorithms.</p><p>Dare I say it? Even *heated* debates about what someone<br/>on the list has DONE or accomplished can be very<br/>productive, educational and inspiring ... as long as<br/>they do not resort to puerile name calling or off-track<br/>derailments, resulting in the train of thought<br/>plummeting down the embankment towards the rocks below,<br/>to be dashed to smitheereens and destroying everyone on<br/>board the train.</p><p>&gt; Both purposes might suggest a positive and constructive focus<br/>&gt; for messages and threads. Is it not desirable that people<br/>&gt; should not only share their enjoyment and exciting musical<br/>&gt; ideas here, but leave with a feeling of comradeship and<br/>&gt; friendly encouragement to create more beautiful music?</p><p>Or feel challenged not by contentious words, but by<br/>challenging music that has been thrown down, as if a<br/>gauntlet.</p><p>Men and women do differ here, and I think there is room<br/>for both types of energy. Some masculine energies like<br/>to challenge one another. I think that is fine and very<br/>productive as long as it does not get personal.<br/>Certainly trying to drag another&apos;s uninvolved family<br/>members into the fray would cross the line.</p><p>I suppose there could be &apos;staged events&apos; like they have<br/>in wrestling, where a couple of people put on a phoney<br/>fight in order to amuse and entertain, but that should<br/>be done between people who know each other and are<br/>doing so by mutual consent.</p><p>&gt; encourage people to pursue their own musical ideals in an<br/>&gt; active and creative way, can we not better build our<br/>&gt; crazy_music community through free choice and<br/>&gt; self-moderation?</p><p>Good summary.</p><p>&gt; If self-moderation appeals to us as a community of mutual<br/>&gt; concern, then it may have one special advantage.</p><p>&gt; Self-moderation focuses on the present, on what is being<br/>&gt; posted now, and invites each participant to offer new threads<br/>&gt; or replies which promote our themes of creativity and<br/>&gt; friendship.</p><p>Everyone should really consider themselves responsible<br/>for their own behavior at the very least, particularly<br/>before presuming to dictate the behavior others.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Oh -- as an afterthought, I noticed on another list<br/>that when people spend a lot of time talking about<br/>theory, it seems as if the seldom have anything to show<br/>for it, yet they get a lot of friendly encouragement<br/>from others to continue, so they continue with theories<br/>and never get down to the business of music. So we see<br/>an example where encouragement can reinforce<br/>dysfunctional (in this group that means non-musical)<br/>behavior.</p><p>I propose that if someone is posting about theories and<br/>never has any music to show for it, that we not give<br/>them any feedback at all, except to perhaps ask if they<br/>have any music demonstrating their theories (each<br/>responsible for his own theories, rather than dictating<br/>that others provide proof), or offer technical help to<br/>get to that point, and then not responding to them<br/>until they can provide evidence and get on topic with<br/>the group. If there is a strong need to post and<br/>discuss theory, detached from real-life empirical<br/>examples, it would be better to create a new group for<br/>that or perhaps use one of the existing other groups<br/>where it may be more on topic.</p><p>I believe this will also help keep down the non-musical<br/>noise level and help the group focus on its charter --<br/>the active creation of music.</p><p>Jeff</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2001 9:16:12 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and here&apos;s a MIDI version of a composition<br/>that I&apos;m posting around, with much appreciation to all the creative<br/>energy here that has lent me inspiration in actually putting this<br/>piece into a settled form and making it available on the &apos;Net:</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>For Brian McLaren, especially, I&apos;ll take note that this piece uses a<br/>certain technique strongly advocated by Ivor Darreg, one that<br/>interestingly goes back to another very justly famed xenharmonicist.</p><p>As a very playful and unscientific &quot;survey,&quot; I might invite anyone to<br/>identify this technique before I reveal it.</p><p>Thanks to all of you for bringing together energies which can this a<br/>forum for sharing music, ideas, and information in a friendly and<br/>enthusiastic community.</p><p>Peace and love to all,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>mschulter &#x3C;MSCHULTER@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/28/2001 11:36:38 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hello, there, everyone, and please let me thank Brian and Kraig and<br/>Mary and Bob and others for a dialogue on musical style and small<br/>integer ratios which suggests to me that a bit of historical<br/>background might put this &quot;debate&quot; in a different perspective.</p><p>Of course, since sharing new music is a major theme of this group, I<br/>can&apos;t resist the opportunity to include a piece I wrote back in 1985,<br/>in a 13th-century European kind of style: _Homage to Joyce Ball_, then<br/>a librarian at the local university library.</p><p>The piece is actually a setting for three voices of one version of a<br/>typical closing announcement: &quot;May I have your attention please: The<br/>library will be closing in ten minutes.

Together with the octave<br/>(2:1), these intervals form complete or &quot;perfect&quot; three-voice<br/>sonorities which in English I call trines (expressing the _trina<br/>harmoniae perfectio_ or &quot;threefold perfection of harmony&quot;) with pure<br/>ratios in Pythagorean tuning of 2:3:4 (e.g. D3-A3-D4, with C4 as<br/>middle C).</p><p>In Renaissance-Romantic styles of this same region, however, major and<br/>minor thirds ideally tuned at or near ratios of 5:4 and 6:5 are the<br/>primary concords. The new stable three-voice sonority, known as<br/>_harmonia perfetta_ or _trias harmonica_ (English &quot;triad&quot;), has a<br/>ratio in 16th-century just intonation systems of 4:5:6, approximated<br/>rather closely in familiar meantone tunings of the era.</p><p>Thus an advocate of &quot;harmonic series evolution&quot; can argue that the<br/>shift from medieval trine (2:3:4) to _harmonia perfetta_ or triad<br/>(4:5:6) represents historical movement &quot;up the harmonic series,&quot; an<br/>outlook of the kind Kraig has suggested.</p><p>However, as Brian has very correctly emphasized, when we look at the<br/>totality of musical style (or as much as we can describe and analyze,<br/>however imperfectly), then both practice and theory suggest the<br/>limitations of such a model, especially in its popular and stereotyped<br/>versions based on the notion of &quot;progress from the simple to the<br/>complex.&quot;</p><p>Specifically, for example:</p><p>           (1) As early as around 1030, Guido d&apos;Arezzo recognizes<br/>               the use of vertical major seconds (9:8) and major<br/>               thirds (81:64) as cadential intervals resolving<br/>               to a unison, and recommends the use of these<br/>               intervals along with stable fourths (4:3).</p><p>           (2) Major seconds or ninths (9:4) and minor sevenths (16:9)<br/>               are often mixed with fifths and/or fourths in Gothic<br/>               and other world polyphonies to form relatively<br/>               concordant sonorities such as 6:8:9 (e.g. C3-F3-G3)<br/>               or 4:6:9 (e.g. G3-D4-A4) -- sonorities treated more<br/>               freely in 13th-14th century European music than in<br/>               Renaissance-Romantic styles based on stable thirds<br/>               and sixths;</p><p>           (3) Around 1300, Jacobus of Liege notes that the major<br/>               ninth serves as a pleasing partial concord in a<br/>               three-voice sonority where it is mixed with two<br/>               fifths (i.e. 4:6:9), and suggests that the interval<br/>               of a major 23rd (triple octave plus whole-tone) at<br/>               a ratio of 9:1 is a &quot;perfect concord&quot; -- the ninth<br/>               harmonic, as many current JI theorists might say.</p><p>           (4) Composers of the era of around 1200-1400, such as<br/>               Perotin and Machaut, use bold sonorities featuring<br/>               minor thirds and minor sevenths, for example, which<br/>               resolve to stable trines or fifths -- contrasting<br/>               with the much more cautious treatment of such<br/>               sevenths in 15th-16th century styles.</p><p>           (5) Gothic theorists often recognize a subtle continuum<br/>               of concord/discord with four, five, or six categories,<br/>               and describe a range of cadential resolutions and<br/>               sonorities featuring unstable intervals (seconds,<br/>               thirds, sixths, and sevenths).</p><p>Around 1200, for example, Perotin boldly uses sonorities featuring the<br/>major seventh (243:128, ~1110 cents), a complex interval and an<br/>acutely tense one in this kind of setting. While &quot;evolution up the<br/>harmonic series&quot; may not provide an obvious explanation for this, a<br/>love of dramatic contrasts between concord and discord, plus melodic<br/>factors, do offer a ready musical motivation.</p><p>In this debate, I consider it important to recognize that most<br/>European music history over the past two centuries or a bit more has<br/>been written from an explicit or implicit perspective: &quot;The Origins of<br/>18th-century Harmony.&quot; Stylistic traits that seem irrelevant or even<br/>&quot;counterproductive&quot; from the viewpoint of this paradigm tend to be<br/>ignored, or even denigrated as &quot;crude dissonances&quot; or the like.</p><p>Certain world musics, or eras of European composition, may not fit in<br/>with the established models -- any more than a tuning such as 11-tET<br/>does. Striving to follow the example of Ivor Darreg, I would argue<br/>that each cultural tradition and style may have its own valuable<br/>&quot;mood,&quot; and that appreciating the range of moods may enrich dialogues<br/>or debates on topics such as &quot;harmonic evolution.&quot;</p><p>                            II</p><p>Here I would like to take the approach of considering the history of<br/>Western European composition from the earliest recorded polyphony to<br/>the present as a single day of music. While the focus here will be<br/>mainly on Western Europe, I will mention other world traditions, not<br/>only to avoid total Eurocentricism but to note some patterns<br/>placing certain features of some historical European styles in a<br/>larger perspective.</p><p>Although the first known treatises documenting the art of polyphony,<br/>or music for two or more simultaneous voices, seem to date from around<br/>850-900, let us arbitrarily start our &quot;day&quot; a bit earlier, at the<br/>convenient year 800.</p><p>Thus our day will cover a rounded 1200 years, with each century<br/>lasting for two hours. Here I&apos;ll be concerned mainly with the first<br/>two-thirds of this day, from midnight to 4 p.m., or 800-1600.<br/>As we&apos;ll see, &quot;High Noon&quot; (1400) is a significant point in the history<br/>of intonation.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>1. Midnight (800): The dawn of recorded European polyphony<br/>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As we start our clock at midnight in 800, the era of Charlemagne in<br/>Western Europe, it is possible that the sophisticated orchestral<br/>tradition of Japanese gagaku music with its complex &quot;clusters&quot; built<br/>from superimposed fifths or fourths is already established.</p><p>In 814, ecclesiastical authorities are recognizing linguistic reality<br/>by moving from a strategy of &quot;educating&quot; parishioners in &quot;correct&quot;<br/>Latin to one of calling for sermons in the _lingua Romana rustica_,<br/>the language of the people, now known as Old French.</p><p>Around 850 or so, writers start recording what might well represent a<br/>traditional style of polyphony based mainly on fifths and fourths,<br/>intervals favored in many world cultures: they speak of _organum_ or<br/>&quot;organized music,&quot; and write in a manner suggesting that this practice<br/>is already well known. While these stable intervals, plus octaves and<br/>elevenths (8:3) or twelfths (3:1), are central to the style, unstable<br/>intervals including major seconds or thirds appear now and then in<br/>certain examples involving oblique or contrary motion.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------<br/>2. Four a.m. (1000): Cadential practice and theory<br/>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>By around 1000, or 4 a.m., at places such as Winchester and Chartres,<br/>this kind of largely improvised style has given rise to compositional<br/>traditions where the melodies added to a chant are recorded.</p><p>Around 1030, Guido in his _Micrologus_ offers what may be the first<br/>known presentation in this tradition specifically recommending the use<br/>of unstable major seconds (9:8) and major or minor thirds (81:64,<br/>32:27) as elements of style.</p><p>Our sources for this era seem to suggest a typical style around 1000<br/>centering around motion from unison to fourth and eventually back<br/>again to a concluding unison, with unstable second and thirds often<br/>lending both melodic grace and vertical tension to the texture.</p><p>Interestingly, Richard Hoppin has offered an example of traditional<br/>Chinese polyphony where there is an interplay between vertical octaves<br/>at the opening or conclusion of phrases and parallel fourths in<br/>between, suggesting a possible kinship between various world<br/>traditions (whatever the &quot;explanations&quot;).</p><p>As the 11th century (4 a.m.-6 a.m.) continues in Western Europe,<br/>musicians and composers move toward a style of two-voice improvisation<br/>or writing using _all_ intervals from the unison to the octave,<br/>bringing into play unstable intervals such as sixths and sevenths.<br/>Around 1100, John of Afflighem (or &quot;John Cotton&quot;) remarks that<br/>different people treat organum in different ways (he may be the first<br/>to derive this term from the instrument of the organ, one of several<br/>meanings for _organum_), but that he favors an approach centered on<br/>the idea of contrary motion.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------<br/>3. The flowering of polyphony -- a Georgian interlude<br/>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>During the 12th century (6 a.m.-8 a.m.), a style often especially<br/>favoring contrary motion while featuring all types of motions and<br/>intervals gets established in Western Europe -- but its exponents are<br/>by no means alone.</p><p>At the same time, in Georgia, theorists are documenting three-voice<br/>singing, notably also based on fifths and fourths as the most favored<br/>concords, while featuring a variety of other intervals. By the end of<br/>the century, three-voice polyphony will also become the new and<br/>exciting trend in the West.</p><p>Maybe a bit after 7 a.m., or 1150, Leonin is writing his most prolific<br/>collection of two-voice polyphony, music sometimes featuring acutely<br/>tense intervals such as major sevenths resolving to octaves, as well<br/>as the usual stable concords and &quot;compatible&quot; unstable intervals<br/>(e.g. M2, m3, M3, M6, m7).</p><p>------------------------------------------<br/>4. Eight a.m. (1200) -- the Perotinian era<br/>------------------------------------------</p><p>By around 1200 -- 8 a.m. -- Perotin and his colleagues are writing<br/>exquisite pieces for three and four voices, featuring a rich variety<br/>of stable and unstable sonorities of the kind also found in traditions<br/>such as those of Georgian singing and of Kirghiz instrumental music.</p><p>One feature shared in common not only between these traditions, but<br/>among many world traditions ranging from Japanese koto music to the<br/>khene or &quot;mouth organ&quot; music of Laos, is the use of sonorities<br/>superimposing fifths or fourths with major seconds or ninths or minor<br/>sevenths. Such sonorities have a kind of &quot;relatively concordant&quot;<br/>quality quite different from that of either a bare fifth or fourth, or<br/>a bare major second or ninth or minor seventh: thus combining three or<br/>more voices opens up new musical possibilities.</p><p>At the same time, the relatively concordant but complex and unstable<br/>major and minor thirds of Pythagorean tuning -- as treated in this<br/>Gothic tradition -- play a vital musical role, often impelling<br/>directed cadential action and also providing a resource for sheer<br/>vertical color.</p><p>Often an interval is defined not only by its degree of concord or<br/>discord, of blend or tension, but how it may typically resolve: major<br/>seconds expanding to fourths by contrary motion, or contracting to<br/>unisons by conjunct motion (highly recommended by Guido around 1030);<br/>thirds contracting to unisons or expanding to fifths; major or minor<br/>sixths expanding to octaves, or sometimes obliquely resolving to<br/>fifths; and major or minor sevenths contracting to fifths, or<br/>expanding obliquely to octaves.</p><p>This &quot;musical geometry&quot; uniting vertical and melodic dimensions shapes<br/>much of the Gothic repertory of progressions -- with arguably somewhat<br/>analogous patterns playing a role in Georgian music, for example,<br/>although each tradition has its own logic.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>5. Ten a.m. (1300): Multi-voice theory -- and a new practice<br/>------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>By around 1300, or 10 a.m., theorists such as Johannes de Grocheio and<br/>Jacobus of Liege are writing about the ideally harmonious qualities of<br/>the complete three-voice trine, and Jacobus also describes and<br/>sanctions a range of unstable sonorities for three or more voices.</p><p>As he points out, for example, the Pythagorean tradition of the four<br/>hammers or strings with ratios of 12:9:8:6 lends a certain degree of<br/>&quot;concord&quot; to the pure 9:8 major second, and he endorses 4:6:9 as a<br/>pleasant three-voice sonority. As noted, this type of sonority occurs<br/>in many world cultures, with or without this kind of mathematical<br/>approach.</p><p>Jacobus also describes a three-voice sonority called the _quinta<br/>fissa_ or &quot;split fifth&quot; where a fifth is divided into a major and<br/>minor third (e.g. G3-B3-D4 or D3-F3-A3), 64:81:96 or 54:64;81 as<br/>expressed in modern frequency ratios. He recommends these sonorities<br/>as pleasing when aptly resolved.</p><p>In medieval Europe, as elsewhere, tastes could vary: both musical<br/>pieces themselves and theoretical evidence document a penchant in<br/>parts of England and Scandanavia for major and minor thirds as &quot;the<br/>best concords,&quot; to borrow the words of a scholar writing maybe around<br/>1275 and now known as Coussemaker&apos;s Anonymous IV.</p><p>Very possibly this penchant for more fully concordant thirds may have<br/>favored simpler ratios at or near 5:4 or 6:5. The English theorists<br/>Theinred of Dover (12th or 13th century?) and Walter Odington<br/>(c. 1300) explain the relatively concordant effect of thirds by noting<br/>that the Pythagorean ratios are close to these simple ones, with<br/>Odington adding that apt singers can make them sound fully<br/>concordant.</p><p>At the same time, Odington asserts that contrary to the opinion of<br/>some musicians, major seconds (9:8) and ninths (9:4) are not<br/>&quot;compatible&quot; -- Jacobus, in contrast, describes these same intervals<br/>as &quot;imperfect&quot; or &quot;intermediate&quot; concords, and describes the use of<br/>6:8:9 or 8:9:12 as well as his favored 4:6:9.</p><p>This era around 1300 marks not only some fascinating theoretical<br/>analyses of 13th-century practice, but the advent of a new and<br/>&quot;modern&quot; style: the _Ars Nova_, or &quot;New Art.&quot;</p><p>Composers such as Philippe de Vitry introduce new notational systems<br/>to handle duple as well as triple time, bringing into play techniques<br/>such as syncopation which will develop into more and more complex<br/>styles of polyrhythmic music as the century progresses.</p><p>Jacobus, for one, loves the music of his youth in the late 13th<br/>century, but dislikes the new style, citing a kind of psychoacoustical<br/>survey in which some listeners were given a chance to hear pieces in<br/>both the old and new styles, and preferred the old.</p><p>The Ars Nova style nevertheless prevailed, but with composers of the<br/>modern style such as Guillaume de Machaut (1300-1377) often availing<br/>themselves of traditional 13th-century liberties such as the use of<br/>sonorities involving minor sevenths or major ninths, intervals<br/>endorsed by Jacobus but excluded from the basic vocabulary of some<br/>&quot;modern&quot; 14th-century counterpoint treatises.</p><p>While typical 14th-century styles nicely fit the standard system of<br/>Pythagorean intonation, one xenharmonicist deserves special mention:<br/>Marchettus (or Marchetto) of Padua.</p><p>Completed in 1318, his _Lucidarium_ may well call for use of cadential<br/>major thirds and sixths defining in effect new classes of intervals: a<br/>large major third at around 453 cents, or about midway between the<br/>usual Pythagorean major third and fourth; and a major sixth which he<br/>describes as equally distant from 3:2 fifth and 2:1 octave, or around<br/>951 cents, about midway between usual major sixth and minor seventh.</p><p>His special emphasis is on the principle of &quot;closest approach,&quot; in<br/>which thirds expanding to fifths or sixths to octaves should be<br/>&quot;colored&quot; or made major in order to make the resolution to a stable<br/>concord more efficient. While other theorists find the usual<br/>Pythagorean intervals ideal for this purpose, Marchettus appears to<br/>carry it yet further, advocating the use of a cadential semitone or<br/>&quot;diesis&quot; of possibly somewhere around 41-48 cents, in contrast to the<br/>usual Pythagorean diatonic semitone of 256:243 (~90 cents).</p><p>Both this style of accentuated intonation apparently favored by<br/>Marchettus, and more conventional Pythagorean approaches, focus on a<br/>directed contrast between stable trines and unstable sonorities --<br/>often involving thirds or sixths, and in some musical dialects also<br/>seconds or sevenths.</p><p>Various types of more or less conclusive cadences are used to provide<br/>larger-scale organization for forms such as French ballade or virelai<br/>of Machaut and the Italian ballata of Francesco Landini (1325-1397).</p><p>Near the end of the 14th century, the _Ars subtilior_ or &quot;more subtle<br/>art&quot; achieves rhythmic and polymetric refinements not again equalled<br/>until the 20th century, with the vertical and formal patterns of Ars<br/>Nova trinicism providing a basis for elaborations with subtlety and<br/>beauty perfectly allied.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>6. &quot;High Noon&quot; (1400): A stylistic and intonational transition<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Around our symbolic &quot;high noon,&quot; or the year 1400, we encounter a kind<br/>of intonational demarcation line -- or actually a fuzzy era of<br/>transition in which Pythagorean tuning on the Continent is first<br/>modified and then gradually yields to meantone as the standard<br/>paradigm for keyboard instruments.</p><p>While this era has been viewed by some historians (e.g. Knud Jeppesen)<br/>as a &quot;springtime&quot; of harmony, and by Richard Crocker as a kind of<br/>blurring of the clarity of 14th-century vertical organization, we<br/>might best approach it as a transition between a Gothic style based on<br/>a high level of vertical contrast and a Renaissance style based on<br/>more muted contrasts.</p><p>In a typical Gothic style of the kind prevailing in Continental<br/>Europe, both the treatment of intervals and the qualities of<br/>Pythagorean tuning emphasize a contrast between stable fifths and<br/>fourths with pure ratios, and mildly unstable thirds with complex<br/>ratios.</p><p>By around 1500, however, the new Renaissance textures tend to flow<br/>smoothly between sonorities featuring thirds and sixths as the most<br/>favored intervals, and indeed the emerging standard of stable<br/>saturation. Here the concept of a &quot;smooth&quot; flow means not only the<br/>pervasive use of thirds and sixths, but the rather cautious and<br/>restricted use of seconds or sevenths -- in contrast to their more<br/>prominent role in Gothic styles.</p><p>In the epoch from around noon to 1 p.m., or 1400-1450, two trends<br/>provide a kind of bridge from the old style to the new: modified<br/>Pythagorean keyboard tunings, and a genre known as fauxbourdon.</p><p>Possibly sometime around 1370 or 1380 in regions such as Florence, and<br/>by around 1400-1420 over a wider area of Europe, keyboard tuners often<br/>adopted a technique of tuning a 12-note instrument so that the keys<br/>for written sharps were actually placed at the flat end of the<br/>chain. This meant that written thirds spelled with sharps -- e.g. the<br/>major thirds D-F#, E-G#, and A-C# -- would actually be played as the<br/>diminished fourths D-Gb, E-Ab, and A-Db, and similarly affected minor<br/>thirds as augmented seconds.</p><p>In Pythagorean tuning, as it happens, a diminished fourth has a ratio<br/>very close to 5:4, and an augmented second to 6:5. Through much of the<br/>early 15th century, it would appear, these altered and acoustically<br/>&quot;smoother&quot; thirds were used side-by-side with the traditional and more<br/>active ones (e.g. F-A, G-B, C-E).</p><p>While this trend seems to have taken root in some parts of Continental<br/>Europe by 1415, it may have been reinforced by an event of that year:<br/>an all-too-literal English invasion of France, contrasting in its<br/>martial violence to the gentler transoceanic incursion of the Beatles<br/>in 1964. The Battle of Agincourt not only inspired a famous carol, but<br/>may have the famous English composer John Dunstable to France along<br/>with the Duke of Bedford.</p><p>In any event, by around 1440 a French poet notes that composers such<br/>as Dufay and Binchois follow the &quot;English countenance&quot; of Dunstable,<br/>and looking back in 1477, Tinctoris regards these composers as the<br/>font and origin of the new style.</p><p>One aspect of the new style introduced by composers around 1420-1430<br/>such as the young Guillaume Dufay (c. 1397-1474) is a genre which may<br/>well have been derived at least in part from English sources:<br/>fauxbourdon.</p><p>In some 14th-century Continental compositions, a typical cadence with<br/>major third expanding to fifth and major sixth to octave is preceded<br/>by a set of sixth sonorities in parallel motion: in 1357, Johannes<br/>Boen says that in this type of cadence, the imperfectly or partially<br/>concordant thirds and sixths serve as &quot;forerunners and handmaidens&quot; of<br/>the resolving fifths and octaves.</p><p>In England, starting around the epoch of 1300, such sixth sonorities<br/>often make up much of the bulk of a piece in a style sometimes called<br/>_cantilena_, and the post-Agincourt influence of this tradition would<br/>serve as one source for the fauxbourdon of Dufay and his colleagues.</p><p>A fascinating intonational aspect of such fauxbourdon is that at least<br/>to my ears, it can sound very pleasing in Pythagorean intonation with<br/>complex thirds and sixths, or for that matter in 22-tET with thirds<br/>and sixths near 9:7 and 12:7, for example, as in this example:</p><p>F4  E4  D4  C#4  D4<br/>C4  B3  A3  G#3  A3<br/>A3  G3  F3  E3   D3</p><p>&lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei001.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/22tei001.mid</a>&gt;</p><p>While the term fauxbourdon can refer generally to this type of late<br/>Gothic or early Renaissance texture, more specifically a fauxbourdon<br/>was often a type of composition in which only the outer two parts,<br/>moving mostly in sixths with standard cadences to the octave, were<br/>actually noted. An unwritten middle part was understood to follow a<br/>fourth below the upper voice, or a third above the lower one.</p><p>Here the parallel unstable concords can be heard as a kind of<br/>cadential &quot;free fall&quot; in which the expected resolution is prolonged or<br/>delayed: Pythagorean tuning, as Mark Lindley has noted, can nicely<br/>express the tentative or &quot;sinuous&quot; quality of these partial concords.</p><p>----------------------------<br/>8. One p.m. (1450): Meantone<br/>----------------------------</p><p>However, by around 1450, or 1 p.m., the altered or &quot;odd&quot; thirds of the<br/>modified Pythagorean tunings had come into such vogue that they were<br/>defining a new intonational norm in which as many thirds as possible<br/>should have this smoother quality.</p><p>Meantone temperament was the result, likely reflected first in<br/>practice by the style of pieces by an organ composer such as Conrad<br/>Paumann, and then in theory by an evident description of a meantone<br/>keyboard by Ramos (1482), and a more explicit statement by Gaffurius<br/>(1496) that fifths on the organ are narrowed or tempered<br/>(_participata_) by &quot;a certain small or hidden amount.&quot;</p><p>Here I might add, to place my own mathematical tendencies in some<br/>balance, that musicians were likely tuning keyboards in meantone for a<br/>century or so before Zarlino (1558) came up with a mathematical model<br/>based on fractions of the syntonic comma. It was done by practice, and<br/>by ear, as some early 16th-century instructions for the aspiring lay<br/>reader indicate.</p><p>While treated in a more cautious manner in typical Renaissance styles<br/>than in the often exuberant Gothic tradition, seconds and sevenths<br/>play a subtle and indeed vital role as suspensions, with a suspended<br/>6:8:9 sonority (e.g. C4-F4-G4, the fourth resolving to a third,<br/>e.g. C4-E4-G4) for example often serving as a cadential &quot;marker.&quot;</p><p>Thus the diverse and often dramatically contrasting sonorities of the<br/>Gothic era give way to the rather smooth and homogenous textures of<br/>the Renaissance.</p><p>In 1555, or 3:06 p.m., this Renaissance style serves as the setting<br/>for one of the great xenharmonic statements of all time, _Ancient<br/>Music Adapted to Modern Practice_ by Nicola Vicentino. The meantone<br/>diesis or &quot;fifthtone,&quot; not too far from the size of the enharmonic<br/>diesis of Greek theory, opens a new world of melody and verticality<br/>still largely to be explored in the 21st century.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------<br/>9. Four p.m. (1600): &quot;high contrast&quot; again in vogue<br/>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>By around 1600, or 4 p.m., trends in the overall balance of the<br/>intervals are again changing, with bold seconds and sevenths again<br/>coming vogue -- now resolving to the stable sonorities dubbed &quot;triads&quot;<br/>by Johannes Lippius (1610, 1612), rather than to Gothic trines.</p><p>The use of a systematic contrast between stable and boldly unstable<br/>sonorities is thus a feature of 13th-14th century Gothic style, and<br/>also of the key system which was established by around the time of<br/>Corelli and Werckmeister (c. 1680), the latter taking much of its<br/>material from the more fluid modal music of the era around 1600 with<br/>its &quot;poetic dissonances.&quot;</p><p>------------------------------------------------<br/>10. Some possible viewpoints and interpretations<br/>------------------------------------------------</p><p>It is noteworthy that the bold use of minor sevenths in either<br/>13th-14th century or 17th-18th century music does not necessarily fit<br/>a simple &quot;harmonic series&quot; scenario, since during these eras the usual<br/>tunings generally yield ratios at or near 16:9 (Pythagorean), or<br/>somewhere between 16:9 and 9:5 (meantone or well-temperament).</p><p>A ratio of 7:4, representing the &quot;seventh harmonic,&quot; is recommended by<br/>Euler in 1764, for example, as a tuning for this interval, and the<br/>augmented sixth of meantone curiously offers a close approximation of<br/>this ratio.</p><p>However, it is interesting that even the acceptance in some<br/>20th-century styles of the minor seventh as an element in _stable_<br/>sonorities may be tied to tuning systems such as 12-tET, where this<br/>interval is some 31 cents wider than 7:4, although quite close to the<br/>Pythagorean ratio of 16:9 formed from two pure fourths.</p><p>How might a person taking the &quot;side&quot; of a &quot;harmonic series&quot; outlook<br/>approach this information?</p><p>One possible interpretation might be to say that various &quot;partials&quot;<br/>have played a role in assorted world musics, with the &quot;third and ninth<br/>partials,&quot; for example, featured in traditions mixing fifths or<br/>fourths (3:2, 4:3) with major seconds or ninths or minor sevenths<br/>(9:8, 9:4, 16:9). From the Gothic music of Europe to the koto music of<br/>Japan, these intervals often happily combine.</p><p>In contrast, the Renaissance styles of Europe would place the &quot;fifth<br/>partial&quot; at center stage.</p><p>Taking this kind of approach, it would be possible to note the<br/>relevance of small JI ratios without excluding larger ones. For<br/>example, one might argue that the complex major and minor thirds of<br/>Pythagorean tuning represent a rather &quot;inaccurate&quot; representation of<br/>the simplest 5-based ratios, thus offering a great artistic potential<br/>realized in the &quot;imperfect&quot; or partial concords of the Gothic era.</p><p>However, there&apos;s also the other side: is &quot;justness,&quot; even if presented<br/>in this more sophisticated kind of way, really a central feature of<br/>world musics? The traditions of tuning in pure fifths and fourths in<br/>various cultures, and of &quot;5-limit&quot; tunings in Renaissance Europe and<br/>the sruti system of India, suggest that JI ideals are _one_<br/>significant approach -- but are they _the_ prevailing approach?</p><p>Here such phenomena as 720-cent fifths and 1215-cent octaves, as well<br/>as pragmatic rather than mathematically precise tunings used in many<br/>world cultures, present &quot;the other side of the coin.&quot;</p><p>Also, even within the much narrower scope of the historical European<br/>compositional tradition, to &quot;just&quot; or &quot;equal&quot; tunings we should add<br/>such important categories as meantones (some of which may happen to<br/>define equal divisions of the octave) and unequal well-temperaments.</p><p>Here we might also delve into various Near Eastern currents of<br/>practice and theory where conceptual Pythagorean ratios often mix with<br/>instruments and performance traditions approximating something like<br/>17-tET, for example.</p><p>What I would urge mainly is that both &quot;sides&quot; in this debate -- or<br/>maybe, for some of us, different and not necessarily antagonistic<br/>&quot;sides&quot; of our own musical experience -- can take on a richer and more<br/>musically satisfying quality as they are informed by the diversity of<br/>world traditions and practices.</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2001 4:29:55 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:crazy_music@yahoogroups.com">crazy_music@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Friday, July 27, 2001 9:16 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [crazy_music] A composition -- with Ivor Darreg connection<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/invoc4a.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; For Brian McLaren, especially, I&apos;ll take note that this piece uses a<br/>&gt; certain technique strongly advocated by Ivor Darreg, one that<br/>&gt; interestingly goes back to another very justly famed xenharmonicist.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; As a very playful and unscientific &quot;survey,&quot; I might invite anyone to<br/>&gt; identify this technique before I reveal it.</p><p>Well, I&apos;ve figured it out!</p><p>But I think I&apos;ll keep quiet and see if anyone else gets it.<br/>(Meantime, my response goes to Margo privately.)</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>jpehrson@...</h3><span>7/29/2001 8:00:30 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>--- In crazy_music@y..., mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@V...&gt; wrote:</p><p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/768">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/crazy_music/message/768</a><br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; What I&apos;d like to try is a somewhat different method for suggesting<br/>&gt; some overview of stylistic change -- one with a focus on xenharmonic<br/>&gt; developments.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; First, I&apos;ll try summing up a few of my general opinions and biases<br/>in this debate, and then move to my main presentation.<br/>&gt;</p><p>Many thanks to Margo Schulter for including this fascinating post<br/>about the evolution of tuning.
