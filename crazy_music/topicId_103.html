(I&apos;m not eating prunes or anything, just<br/>following fewer lists...)</p><p>So I will not be available, for the time being, to post on Jeff<br/>Scott&apos;s interesting &quot;Spritual Tuning&quot; list.  However, I am continuing<br/>to post over here on &quot;Crazy Music...&quot;</p><p>There was a question as to which pieces of mine were possibly &quot;most<br/>spiritual.&quot;  Actually, I feel there is a spiritual element of one<br/>kind of another in virtually ALL my music, but I believe there *IS* a<br/>piece in my oeuvre that fits this dimension more than some.</p><p>This piece is called THANATOPSIS and is dedicated to my father who<br/>had a paralyzing stroke that left him a quadroplegic for 13 years<br/>until his death.  I found a text from William Cullen Bryant that<br/>related to death and the gradual metamorphosis that we all go through<br/>if we are to accept it &quot;gracefully...&quot; if there is such a thing.  In<br/>a sense, this poem is the antithesis of the poem that Stravinsky set<br/>(no composer comparison, obviously, here) of Dylan Thomas...<br/>remember &quot;Don&apos;t go gentle into that dark night...&quot;  Well, this poem<br/>suggests that we DO go gentle... In fact, perhaps we should carry<br/>both death AND life a big more lightly than we generally do in<br/>practically an Eastern sense.</p><p>Since this is the PRACTICAL crazy list, and not the IMPRACTICAL crazy<br/>list, I will keep my comments brief (relatively) but here is the poem:</p><p>Poetry by William Cullen Bryant:</p><p>To him who in the love of Nature holds<br/>Communion with her visible forms she speaks.<br/>She has a voice of gladness and a smile...<br/>And eloquence of beauty and she glides<br/>Into his darker musings with a mild<br/>And healing sympathy that steals away<br/>Their sharpness ere he is aware.</p><p>When thoughts of the last bitter hour come<br/>like a blight over thy spirit<br/>And sad images of the stern agony and<br/>shroud and pall<br/>And breathless darkness and the narrow house<br/>Make thee to shudder and grow sick at heart...</p><p>Go forth under the open sky and list to Na-tures<br/>teachings, while from all around<br/>Earth and her waters and the depths of air<br/>comes a still voice...</p><p>SPOKEN:<br/>Yet a few days, and thee<br/>The all-beholding sun shall see no more<br/>In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,<br/>Where thy pale form was laid with many tears<br/>Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist<br/>Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim<br/>They growth, to be resolved to earth again,<br/>And, lost each human trace, surrendering up<br/>Thine individual being, shalt thou go<br/>To mix forever with the elements.</p><p>(Sung)<br/>So live that when thy summons comes to join<br/>The innumerable caravan which moves<br/>To that mysterious realm where each shall take<br/>His chamber in the silent halls of death</p><p>Yhen go not like the quarry slave at night<br/>Scourged to his dungeon but, sustained and soothed<br/>By an unfaltering trust approach thy grave<br/>Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch<br/>About him and lies down to pleasant dreams...<br/>... ... ...</p><p>And here is the piece:</p><p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/590/590441.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/590/590441.html</a></p><p>It&apos;s &quot;safe sonority,&quot; by the way... lots of glissandos and non-12<br/>equal in it...</p><p>___________ _______ _____<br/>Joseph Pehrson</p></div><h3><a id=108 href="#108">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>6/5/2001 9:03:13 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>THis is beautiful Joe.
