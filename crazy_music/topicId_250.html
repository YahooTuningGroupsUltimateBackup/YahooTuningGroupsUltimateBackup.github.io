I<br/>hate it; some people love it; that&apos;s fine.  There is room in the<br/>universe of music for tastes widely varied, that&apos;s for sure!  I wouldn&apos;t<br/>even consider trying to write music in an ET lacking basic consonances,<br/>but others do and are very happy with the results.</p><p>I&apos;ll probably be gone before the historical verdict on 12-tET is<br/>written.  My own guess is that the period of its complete dominance in<br/>Western music, a period marked by the temporary near-death of consonant<br/>thirds and sixths, will be judged by history to be a &quot;dark age&quot; for<br/>music.  Music majors finish college today without ever studying the<br/>harmonic series; can we wonder why their sense of intonation is so poor?<br/>Once trained, other options are no longer obscure, and even old dogs can<br/>learn new tricks if they&apos;re open to doing so.</p><p>Even I, a consonance junkie, freely acknowledge that other factors are<br/>as important, or more so, in music.  Good intonation is more the icing<br/>on the cake.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=252 href="#252">ðŸ”—</a>George Zelenz &#x3C;ploo@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2001 9:59:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>JdL,</p><p>Yes.</p><p>If the vitamins, minerals, calories, and carbohydrates are in the icing,<br/>then yes.</p><p>Intonation is the icing on the cake.</p><p>Respectively,</p><p>GZ</p><p>&quot;John A. deLaubenfels&quot; wrote:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Even I, a consonance junkie, freely acknowledge that other factors are<br/>&gt; as important, or more so, in music.

Coming from someone who<br/>is also unabashedly critical of my work, it is in a strange way all the<br/>more sweet.</p><p>Tell you what, though: if it ever happened that my (type of) treatments<br/>were all that we could hear, I&apos;d get the creeps too!!  That _would_ be<br/>strange.  But 12-tET (and now, other) options are never going to die, I<br/>don&apos;t believe.  Yes, we should know better than to substitute one kind<br/>of homogeneity with another, and I think that we (as a world of music<br/>creators and listeners) _do_ know better.</p><p>The contradictory constraints of a complex piece limit the extent to<br/>which it can receive JI treatment, but beyond that, a piece might want<br/>to save its sweetest consonances for special moments, and make the<br/>audience wait for those moments.  Or, goodness knows, a piece may<br/>forego consonances altogether and still be a wonderful work.</p><p>As I&apos;ve said many times, my work represents adaptive tuning in its<br/>extreme infancy (howbeit perhaps more than has been achieved before).<br/>I happen to enjoy wallowing in as much consonance as I can get, but it&apos;s<br/>certainly not the whole story, nor will it ever be.</p><p>JdL</p></div><h3><a id=254 href="#254">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/9/2001 11:39:00 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>[George Zelenz wrote:]<br/>&gt;JdL,</p><p>&gt;Yes.</p><p>&gt;If the vitamins, minerals, calories, and carbohydrates are in the<br/>&gt;icing, then yes.</p><p>&gt;Intonation is the icing on the cake.</p><p>&gt;Respectively,</p><p>&gt;GZ</p><p>Hi, George!  Yeah, don&apos;t get me wrong, I don&apos;t ever want to be without<br/>control over tuning if I can help it.  Love that icing!!  At the same<br/>time, 12-tET wouldn&apos;t have had its 150 year run unless it did a _fairly_<br/>good job, and did allow _some_ beautiful expression.  Thank goodness we<br/>can break free now!</p><p>Take care of that hand.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
