This would theoretically favor such<br/>&gt; Pythagorean tunings as 5, 7, 12, 17, 29, 41, 53, 94, etc.</p><p>It is only that i have ran accross some scales that could be explained<br/>as a chain of triads that i posed the question. True 2 interval patterns<br/>are conceptually simpler, but so on 1 interval patterns such as your<br/>favorites ET&apos;s.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;     However I have composed in both 17- and 19-note Pythagorean<br/>&gt; tunings, both 22-note and 29-note Pythagorean tunings.  Although 17-<br/>&gt; note Py has a 2-interval structure (23.4 cents and 90.4 cents) while<br/>&gt; 19-note has a 3-interval structure, my ears don&apos;t hear any difference<br/>&gt; in terms of the overall comprehensibility of the scales.</p><p>&gt; This has been my response to those 3 interval scales.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;      The same applies to 1/4-comma meantone as opposed to 12-note<br/>&gt; Pythagorean, or the diatonic syntonon as opposed to 19 just 5/4s in<br/>&gt; the 2:1, etc.  Once again 1/4-comma meantone is a 3-interval system<br/>&gt; while 12 note Pythagorean is a 2-interval system.  Likewise the<br/>&gt; diatonic syntonon (1/1 9/8 10/9 1/615/ 9/8 10/9 9/8 16/15 in delta<br/>&gt; intervals) is a 3-interval system.<br/>&gt;     In my hands-on musical experience, all this math proves entirely<br/>&gt; irrelevant to the actual sound of the tunings. I have no problem<br/>&gt; hearing or dealing with or composing with or listening to music in 3-<br/>&gt; interval tunings as opposed to 2-interval tunings.<br/>&gt;     Thus the question of 3- interval as opposed to 2-interval tunings<br/>&gt; must be accounted a paper tiger, a theory quibbel with no connection<br/>&gt; to real tunings in the real world.</p><p>I would agree that theroy has no purpose unless one has a definite<br/>application. The three interval patterns if structured from the<br/>superposition of a triad is useful if one felt a compositional desire to<br/>base something on a particular triad, maybe parellel or not. Not an<br/>unusual desire.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; ------<br/>&gt;     What other issues loom when we wnat to determine where to stop in<br/>&gt; generating a tuning?<br/>&gt;     Presumably Kraig is talking about JI or NJ NET tunings, since<br/>&gt; once you have specified the number of equal steps into which an<br/>&gt; octave (or other interval) is divided you automatically know where to<br/>&gt; stop.  If you divide the octave into 23 equal parts, thenyou stop at<br/>&gt; 23. So Kraig&apos;s question doesn&apos;t seem to have much bearing on equal<br/>&gt; divisions of the octave or non-octave cyclic multiplier.</p><p>correct</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     In JI tunings the roughness of the tuning has some bearing. As<br/>&gt; you cojntinue to subdivide the octave by wrapping around at the 2;1<br/>&gt; the roughness of the JI tuning will decrease. That is, the ratio<br/>&gt; twixt largest and smallest musical intervals will drop.<br/>&gt;     However, once again roughness of a JI tuning does not seem to<br/>&gt; have any audible consequences. 19 just 5/4s in the 2;1 has a fairly<br/>&gt; high roughness, with a 181-cent interval and a a 40-cent intervals.<br/>&gt; With a roughness of nearly 5, you might think this JI tuning would be<br/>&gt; musically useless. However, until Jeff Scott purged it, I had an MP3<br/>&gt; clip of a piece of music using 19 just 5/4s in the 2:1 and you could<br/>&gt; hear for yourself that there was no problem with composing or<br/>&gt; listening to such JI tunings where the largest elementary interval<br/>&gt; was much larger than the smallest elementary interval.<br/>&gt;     Likewise, 17-note Pythagorean sounds great, even though the<br/>&gt; largest elementary interfval (90 cents) was about 4 times the size of<br/>&gt; the smallest elementary interval (23.4 cents).<br/>&gt;     So the roughness of a JI tunig does not seem to have any bearing<br/>&gt; onthe sound or function of the tuning.<br/>&gt; ------<br/>&gt;     The only musically relevant constraint in my experience invovles<br/>&gt; the size of the smallest interval in the tuning. If the smallest<br/>&gt; interval drops much below about 10-15 cents, it will no longer sound<br/>&gt; or function like a musically distinct interval. Instead, it will<br/>&gt; sound like a duplicate of the higher or lower adjacent pitch.</p><p>I remember that Ptolemy thought that interval smaller the 45/44. which<br/>is quite a bit larger. Our ears must of improved over the centuries as i<br/>believe as a rough model, this is close. We both know that context has<br/>some being on this.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     This explains why in some of Erv Wilson&apos;s larger CPS tunings very<br/>&gt; small intervals (less tahn 6 cents) must simply be eliminated from<br/>&gt; the tuning...  Because they just don&apos;t sound like melodic intervals.</p><p>In the 1-3-7-9-11-15  22 tone eikosany i have two 4.5 cent intervals<br/>which when part of a tetrad cannot be replaced by the neighboring tone.<br/>If one were to use  this tuning independent of it structure. you might<br/>leave them out. But I have gotten use to their preseance, kinda like<br/>someone with so gestural  twitch. Such twitches gives it a character<br/>just like Et deviations from harmonics.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -------<br/>&gt;     The other obvious criterion involves whether the triads sound<br/>&gt; stable with sustained harmonc series timbres. If triads in the tuning<br/>&gt; beat very loudly with sustained harmonic series timbres, this can<br/>&gt; have musical consequences.  It need not necessarily become muscialy<br/>&gt; important -- if your style does not make use of sustained harmonic<br/>&gt; series timbres, or if your music uses tone clusters, or if you crank<br/>&gt; up the tempo of your composition to a rapid speed, or if you use<br/>&gt; primarily percussive inharmonic timbres, then it won&apos;t matter whether<br/>&gt; your tuning has extremely acoustically rough triads when played with<br/>&gt; sustained harmonic series timbres.<br/>&gt;     Under other circumstances, depending on the musical style of your<br/>&gt; composition and the timbres and tempi you favor, however, this might<br/>&gt; exert some musical influence.<br/>&gt;      So depending on your compositional style and your tikbres and<br/>&gt; the tmpi you favor, the question of whether your tuning has extremely<br/>&gt; rough triads (when played with harmonic series sustained timbres at<br/>&gt; slow tempo) may become an issue.</p><p>The reverse is also true. that the tuning one picks has characteristics<br/>unique to it own and if beats occur the artist should listen to them, if<br/>they don&apos;t like what they are doing, find one they do.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     -------<br/>&gt;     Dan Stearns posted a great many numbers in his discussion of<br/>&gt; triads in oddball ET tunings like 9 and 11 equal.<br/>&gt;     I don&apos;t hear or see any relevance or musical meaning of just<br/>&gt; intonation triads to ET triads in 9 or 11.<br/>&gt;     9 equal is not a JI tuning. It is an equal division of the<br/>&gt; octave. As a result talking about an ET tuning like 9 equal in terms<br/>&gt; of just ratios seems as meaningless, in my musical experience, as<br/>&gt; talking about the uncle of the state of Kansas, or the color of the<br/>&gt; number 4.  JI scales are JI scales. They exist in one kind of musical<br/>&gt; universe.  ET scales are ET scales, and they exist in another kind of<br/>&gt; musical universe.</p><p>Agreed.  Ets can produce phenomenon unlike JI and this might as well be<br/>exploited. I will venture to say that much happens that we can&apos;t<br/>explain, some which might always remain explainable, yet some which<br/>somedays we might be able to explain</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Trying to discuss equal divisions of the octave in terms of their<br/>&gt; purported approximations of this or that JI construction is in my<br/>&gt; musical experience as meaningless as trying to talk about a JI tuning<br/>&gt; in terms of its purported approximation of<br/>&gt; intervals like 2^[4/12].</p><p>well here we different</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     There is just no musical connection between the two. In my<br/>&gt; musical experience with both 9 and 11 equal and a variety of<br/>&gt; different JI limits, trying to describe equal divisions of the octave<br/>&gt; in terms of JI constructions like &quot;the 11:13:15 triad&quot; represent<br/>&gt; nothing but confusion and a musical dead end.</p><p>in this meaning i agree.</p><p>&gt;</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;        An equal division of the octave is not a degenerate version of<br/>&gt; a JI tuning. An ET is not ANY version of a JI tuning.<br/>&gt;     Equal tunings like 9 equal and 11 equal are what they are --<br/>&gt; equal divisions of the octave. In order to deal with these tunings<br/>&gt; effetively, my musical experience has been that we must throw out<br/>&gt; attempts to falsely view them as warped or<br/>&gt; twisted or otherwise distorted JI tunings, because they aren&apos;t.</p><p>Each tuning should be dealt with what it is empirically</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Each ET has its own musical properties, its own musical<br/>&gt; advantages and disadvantages.<br/>&gt;     In my musical experience there is no &quot;get rich quick scheme&quot; that<br/>&gt; will magically tell us what the musical properties of equal<br/>&gt; divsisions of the octave are.  Not MOS scales, not comparison of<br/>&gt; triads in the ET with some JI construct like 11:13:15, nothing.<br/>&gt;     The *O*N*L*Y way to learn the musical properties of any given<br/>&gt; equal division of the octave, in my experience, is to compose with<br/>&gt; that ET and listening to music in that ET.<br/>&gt;     Math is useless. JI comparison are useless.</p><p>maybe misapplied but not uselss</p><p>&gt; Quasi-evolutionary<br/>&gt; theories like Yasser&apos;s are useless.</p><p>western turning did at least evolve from a 7 tone system to a 12</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Only composing in and listening to music in the ETs in question<br/>&gt; actually yields meaningless knowledge about the musical properties of<br/>&gt; that equal division of the octave.<br/>&gt;     (The same applies to JI and NJ NET tunings.)<br/>&gt; --------<br/>&gt;     The other big problem with trying to discuss ETs in terms of<br/>&gt; their purported approximation of JI constructs like &quot;the 11:13:15<br/>&gt; triad&quot; is that such JI constructs do not tell you whether you will<br/>&gt; get strong beats in the critical band with sustained harmonic series<br/>&gt; timbres.  Such JI constructs also do not tell you whether you will<br/>&gt; get recognizable perfect fifths</p><p>&gt;     Math cannot predict whether the ET will have recognizable perfect<br/>&gt; fifths.</p><p>I have heard ET that sound much better than paper can predict. 34 for<br/>one. possibly the formula for evaluating needs to be changed. i don&apos;t<br/>think we throw out newton because it can&apos;t explain the orbit of mercury.</p><p>&gt; Math always fails.</p><p>math always falls short of the real life experience</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     In 9 equal, the perfect fifth does sound musically recognizable<br/>&gt; at 666.66 cents....but in 18-equal, with the exact same size &quot;perfect<br/>&gt; fifth,&quot; the fifth does NOT sound musically recognizable.</p><p>I liove thing like this</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Because Dan Stearns&apos; procedure of comparing ET tunings with JI<br/>&gt; constructs blots out such important musical information as whether<br/>&gt; the triad in question beats strongly within the critical band, and<br/>&gt; whether the triad in question has recognizable perfect fifths, in my<br/>&gt; experience the attempt to compare ET tunings with JI constructs is<br/>&gt; worthless.</p><p>possibly insufficient in data</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     This, incidentally, is why John deLaubenfels&apos; effort to<br/>&gt; adaptively retune compositions into 5-limit JI typically produces<br/>&gt; results that sound repugnant to many listeners.  Delaubenfels is<br/>&gt; trying to use the 4:5:6 triad as a musical yardstick for major chords<br/>&gt; under all musical circumstances, and like Dan Stearns effort to use<br/>&gt; other types of JI constructs (the 11:13:15 triad, etc.) as musical<br/>&gt; yardsticks, this simply fails.</p><p>I sense that what John is going at is what string players do when they<br/>play, adapt by ear to a myriad of acoustical situations expressive<br/>goals. Where i have a problem is that I sense that do to the language<br/>and function of different elements that make up tonal music, Certain<br/>things like Dominants might have rules &quot;all their own&quot;. what we want<br/>these chords to do is not what we want others to do, i sense we intuit<br/>different intonations for there use. Still we proceed we models that<br/>work in some cases and others come along and finish our shortcomings.<br/>Sometimes the question is more important than the answer and i see no<br/>reason why such endeavors as John&apos;s might not lead to unexpected uses.<br/>    Look at Margo&apos;s work, Who would of guess that such monomaniacal (<br/>and i do mean this lovingly and repectfully) focus on 13th century<br/>music of not only the west but of the church in the west could lead to<br/>where it has for her.<br/> Sometimes the only way to make progress is to regress backward to a<br/>previous step and start from there. Partch felt the need to go back to<br/>the Greeks, an extreme but possibly making it easier for margo to go<br/>back 700 years.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     The human ear/brain doesn&apos;t work that way. There are no small<br/>&gt; integer ratio detectors in our heads. In fact there are no integer<br/>&gt; ratio detectors in our heads at all -- period.</p><p>There is no conclusive evidence of this, against your findings i will<br/>put for Boomliter and Creel.</p><p>&gt; We hear in terms of<br/>&gt; logarithmic pitch distance, and we hear vertical intervals in terms<br/>&gt; of melodic and harmonic context and beats within the critical band.<br/>&gt;     Trying to find out about ET tunings by comaring them with JI<br/>&gt; constructs, whether those constructs be 4:5:6 triads or 11:13:15<br/>&gt; triads, is in my experience musically meaningless and musically<br/>&gt; useless.<br/>&gt;     So what works?<br/>&gt;     Composing in those ETs and building upa  set of rules of thumb.</p><p>Likewise there are things in JI tunings that lie outside of the math<br/>that are just as useful.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Perhaps Dan Stearns would upload 2 compositions each in 9 equal<br/>&gt; and 11 equal so we can hear what he&apos;s doing with those tunings<br/>&gt; musically.  IIn my experience, the sound of a mode or triad proves<br/>&gt; infintiely more informative than sets of silent numbers.<br/>&gt;     Ditto Robert Valentine, who also posted plenty of numbers.<br/>&gt; Perhaps Robert Valentine would upload some musical examples so we can<br/>&gt; hear clearly what he&apos;s discussing.</p><p>See i read it all</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; -------------<br/>&gt; --mclaren</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div>
