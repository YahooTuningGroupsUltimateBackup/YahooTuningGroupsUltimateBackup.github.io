It&apos;s mutual!</p><p>&gt; and after a long pause I got only a 6 note fragment.</p><p>Arg!!</p><p>&gt; You had .mp2 which I though might be causing a problem.</p><p>No, mp2 is fine.</p><p>Many people think its that but it ain&apos;t. mp2 and mp3 are<br/>two versions of the mpeg audio compression standard.<br/>mp3 is best at higher rates of compression. But if you<br/>are trying to go for &apos;hifi&apos; quality, then for the same<br/>size file, mp2 does a better job. All programs that<br/>support mp3 do mp2 as well. Its is only because of<br/>the publicity of sites like <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> and so forth that<br/>people think mp3 is always the way to go.</p><p>Its a common misperception that mp2 is the old obsolete<br/>standard and mp3 is the new fancy better one. But that&apos;s<br/>not true.</p><p>&gt; Today went to reload and told page not available.  More non-<br/>&gt; attachment lessons?(:_)</p><p>Arg, yes got that too just now, and I have some emails<br/>about the same problem...</p><p>This is the second time I have been through this.<br/>First at <a href="http://geocities.com/nonoctave">geocities.com/nonoctave</a>, and now with this<br/>new account.</p><p>The only thing I can guess is that yahoo shuts<br/>you down if you put a big file there.</p><p>I wrote them about the nonoctave site and<br/>they have not responded. I think I have been<br/>shut down for violating some policy but I don&apos;t<br/>know what it is.</p><p>Sorry about the bother.</p><p>Did anyone manage to get any more of this downloaded?<br/>Bummer.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>Graham Breed &#x3C;graham@...&#x3E;</h3><span>5/31/2001 9:29:06 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Jeff wrote:</p><p>&gt; Did anyone manage to get any more of this downloaded?<br/>&gt; Bummer.</p><p>I have it no problem.  I have a good connection at work.</p><p>From home, I find wget in Linux good.  If the download aborts, run it<br/>with -c and it picks up where it left off.  I don&apos;t think it&apos;ll work<br/>with sites that insist on cookies, but I&apos;ve successfuly downloaded<br/>Mary&apos;s files at home before as she has them on a normal website.</p><p>For Windows people, try &lt;<a href="http://www.gozilla.com/">http://www.gozilla.com/</a>&gt;.  It does a better<br/>job, and might even be able to handle <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a> and the files area<br/>here, but it also fills your desktop with eye-candy so I uninstalled<br/>it.</p><p>                     Graham</p></div><h3>nanom3@...</h3><span>5/31/2001 10:11:44 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>.

On<br/>their side it took forever to start the download.</p><p>If you want to pay for web hosting try INterland at<br/><a href="http://www.interland.com/">http://www.interland.com/</a>.   I have been using them for about three<br/>years without any problem.  They work with MAC&apos;s easily (you don&apos;t<br/>have to use FrontPage) and officially allow 150mb storage for<br/>$20/month.  I&apos;ve gone over that limit without any problem however. I<br/>think problems downloading from my site are pretty rare with them.</p><p>Mary</p></div><h3>X. J.

In the<br/>geocities &apos;why did we ban you&apos; pages it says that if they<br/>see you have requests coming in from a non-geocities<br/>referring page, they will assume you are using the site as<br/>a back room storage site, which violates their policy.<br/>They need people to look at the front page with the ads<br/>since that&apos;s how they pay for geocities.</p><p>Maybe that&apos;s why I got dumped. I don&apos;t know anyone who<br/>has ever heard back from yahoo about anything so I<br/>don&apos;t know if they will respond to my email. I imagine<br/>they get reams of email every day and can&apos;t answer it all.</p><p>I will probably reupload to the group directory and then<br/>those with high speed connections should be able to get<br/>it. Others will get the first minute or so.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3>nanom3@...</h3><span>5/31/2001 8:44:00 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; If you want to pay for web hosting</p><p>Unfortunately not even remotely possible right now.</p><p>Jeff play these two songs for a few weeks.
