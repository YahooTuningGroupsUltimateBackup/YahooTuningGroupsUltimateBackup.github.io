It simply pointed<br/>out the fact that you understand the consonance/dissonance<br/>relationships of tones in the same way William Thomson does,<br/>which is the same perspective as &quot;standard&quot; music-theory, and<br/>which I pointed out was *not* the way Schoenberg understood it.</p><p>&gt; Dissonances, according to this theory, are merely more remote<br/>&gt; consonances in the series of overtones.&quot; [Schoenberg, Arnold,<br/>&gt; &quot;Structural Functions of Harmony,&quot; New York: 1954, pg. 193]<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &quot;The dissonances are consonances which as overtones are more<br/>&gt; remotely situated.&quot; [Schoenberg, Arnold, &quot;Harmonielehre,&quot; 1911, pg.<br/>&gt; 356]</p><p>OK, so you want scholarship, I&apos;ll give you scholarship...</p><p>That page number is incorrect: it&apos;s page 358 in the 1911 edition.<br/>For those who want to follow along in English, see Roy Carter&apos;s<br/>1978 translation titled _Theory of Harmony_, p 318-320.</p><p>Page 356 in the original 1911 edition of _Harmonielehre_ is<br/>taken up mostly by a polemic against Schenker, because of his<br/>insistence on &quot;the mysterious number 5&quot; as a &quot;boundary&quot; in many<br/>different aspects of music and harmony, which Schoenberg finds<br/>laughable.</p><p>Also, this &quot;quote&quot; does not appear in exactly these words in<br/>this discussion.  Here is what Schoenberg actually wrote here:</p><p>&gt;&gt; Not merely the accidental chords but also the fundamental<br/>&gt;&gt; ones were discovered because the natural prototype, by allowing<br/>&gt;&gt; these discoveries, evoked them. The major consonances are<br/>&gt;&gt; direct imitations of the prototype, the other consonances,<br/>&gt;&gt; indirect. Both the latter and the former are contained in<br/>&gt;&gt; the overtone series, as overtones whose relations to the<br/>&gt;&gt; fundamental are more or less close. The dissonances,<br/>&gt;&gt; corresponding to the remote overtones, are likewise in part<br/>&gt;&gt; direct imitations of nature (even if inexact, as the tempered<br/>&gt;&gt; system), in part indirect or inferred. The sounding tone<br/>&gt;&gt; vindicates the exact and the inexact imitations. It permits<br/>&gt;&gt; approximations, as the tempered system does in fact show.<br/>&gt;&gt; [Schoenberg, _Harmonielehre_ [1911], p 357-358;<br/>&gt;&gt; _Theory of Harmony_, p 320.]</p><p>And it&apos;s extremely interesting to me that you chose to cite<br/>exactly this part of Schoenberg&apos;s _Harmonielehre_, because<br/>it&apos;s one of the sections I bookmarked long ago, as it is<br/>one of the very few places where Schoenberg actually speaks<br/>favorably about the possibility of using microtones.</p><p>&gt;&gt; What has already been attained is a system that was able to<br/>&gt;&gt; accommodate some overtones with considerable exactness, some<br/>&gt;&gt; others rather inexactly. What has been attained is the almost<br/>&gt;&gt; exhaustive combination of all possibilities of this system by<br/>&gt;&gt; the unconscious ear of the creative musician, by his intuition.<br/>&gt;&gt; Still absolutely missing is the correct identification of the<br/>&gt;&gt; relation between what has been attained and what is still to<br/>&gt;&gt; strive for. We must yet strive for everything that is left over:<br/>&gt;&gt; the precise accommodation of all overtones, the relation to<br/>&gt;&gt; roots, eventually the formation of a new system, the thorough<br/>&gt;&gt; combination of resulting relationships, the invention of<br/>&gt;&gt; instruments that can bring that music into being,... and so forth.<br/>&gt;&gt; [_Harmonielehre_ [1911], p 357; _Theory of Harmony_, p 319-320.]</p><p>Back to mclaren:</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     As even a small child can instantly tell, &quot;the higher we go in<br/>&gt; the  harmonic series, the greater the dissonance of the intervals&quot;<br/>&gt; summarizes the exact gist of what Schoenberg said -- and Schoenberg<br/>&gt; said it not just once, he said it several times. Viz., &quot;Dissonances,<br/>&gt; according to this theory, are...more remote...in the series of<br/>&gt; overtones&quot; [op. cit., 1954] and &quot;The dissonances are...overtones<br/>&gt; which are more remotely situated&quot; in the harmonic series. [op. cit.,<br/>&gt; 1911]</p><p>Brian, perhaps *you* summarized as a &quot;small child&quot;, in this fashion,<br/>&quot;the gist of what Schoenberg said&quot;.</p><p>But read again *every one* of the citations you provided!<br/>In *every* case, Schoenberg is talking about where<br/>&quot;*the* dissonances&quot; appear.  He is *not* saying &quot;intervals<br/>become more dissonant&quot;.  There&apos;s a huge difference... keep reading.</p><p>In fact, he did not believe that these higher-limit ratios<br/>were *dissonant*; he thought of them as &quot;extended consonances&quot;:</p><p>&gt;&gt; The term _emancipation of the dissonance_ refers to its<br/>&gt;&gt; comprehensibility, which is considered equivalent to the<br/>&gt;&gt; consonance&apos;s comprehensibility.  A style based on this<br/>&gt;&gt; premise treats dissonances like consonances.<br/>&gt;&gt; [Schoenberg [1984], _Style and Idea_, p 217]</p><p>The big problem here is something I pointed out in my own<br/>book, of which you (Brian) have a copy.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Certainly, a factor which contributes to much confusion<br/>&gt;&gt; in all of his theoretical writings is the fact that<br/>&gt;&gt; Schoenberg retained the use of *both* &quot;consonance&quot; and<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;dissonance&quot; - two terms which describe polar opposites<br/>&gt;&gt; at the ends of a continuum, instead of adopting &quot;sonance&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; (as I have done), which describes the continuum itself,<br/>&gt;&gt; to indicate the related rather than opposed nature of<br/>&gt;&gt; the relationship between these two concepts.<br/>&gt;&gt; [Monzo [1998], _JustMusic: A New Harmony_, p 123 in the<br/>&gt;&gt; latest version, probably the same page number in the copy<br/>&gt;&gt; you have.]</p><p>Schoenberg thought of the higher overtones as a paradigm for<br/>the chromatic pitches of the 12-tET scale, and as they fit<br/>into a harmonious structure in the single tone, he saw no<br/>reason why they could not fit into chords in the same way.<br/>But he still referred to them as &quot;dissonances&quot;, which is how<br/>the term had been and was still being used by most *other*<br/>theorists and composers.  This is why Thomson missed the<br/>boat on this subject, and apparently you too are still on<br/>the dock with *him*.</p><p>Schoenberg really would have been much better off to jettison<br/>the relative terms &quot;consonance&quot; and &quot;dissonance&quot;, and to replace<br/>them with the single term &quot;sonance&quot;, since that reflects much<br/>better the way he actually thought about this subject.  Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>conception of &quot;relative consonance/dissonance&quot; is *exactly* the<br/>same as Partch&apos;s, the only exception being that Partch used<br/>small-integer ratios as his paradigm where Schoenberg used the<br/>overtone series. [See _Genesis of a Music_, 2nd ed., p 86-87,<br/>and compare with your Schoenberg citations.]</p><p>And, BTW, what happened to the page numbers in your subsequent<br/>citations?  Is there some reason for using the &quot;scholarly vagueness&quot;<br/>for which you criticize me?  Perhaps it&apos;s your way of exhorting<br/>your readers to do some work and read the books themselves?</p><p>The citations you chose from Schoenberg&apos;s _Harmonielehre_ are<br/>near the end of the book, from the chapter on &quot;Non-Harmonic Tones&quot;.<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s thesis was that &quot;ornaments&quot; were the doorway which<br/>eventually led to the free use of the so-called &quot;non-harmonic tones&quot;.</p><p>I leave it to the gentle reader to decide which of us<br/>(McLaren/Thomson or Monzo) is on the right track, if indeed we<br/>are not both wrong.  Here&apos;s what Schoenberg actually has to say,<br/>in detail, on the subject of &quot;Consonance and Dissonance&quot;, from<br/>Chapter 3 of _Harmonielehre_, which carries those words as its<br/>heading:</p><p>&gt;&gt; ... Therefore, I will proceed in my study from the possibly<br/>&gt;&gt; uncertain overtone theory because what I can deduce from it<br/>&gt;&gt; seems to agree with the evolution of the harmonic means.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Once again: the tone is the material of music. It must therefore<br/>&gt;&gt; be regarded, with all its properties and effects, as suitable<br/>&gt;&gt; for art. All sensations that it releases - indeed, these are<br/>&gt;&gt; the effects that make known its properties - bring their<br/>&gt;&gt; influence to bear in some sense on the form of which the<br/>&gt;&gt; tone is a component, that is, on the piece of music. In the<br/>&gt;&gt; overtone series, which is one of the most remarkable properties<br/>&gt;&gt; of the tone, there appear after some stronger-sounding overtones<br/>&gt;&gt; a number of weaker-sounding ones. Without a doubt the former<br/>&gt;&gt; are more familiar to the ear, while the latter, hardly<br/>&gt;&gt; perceptible, are rather strange. In other words: the overtones<br/>&gt;&gt; closer to the fundamental seem to contribute more or more<br/>&gt;&gt; perceptibly to the total phenomenon of the tone - tone accepted<br/>&gt;&gt; as euphonious, suitable for art - while the more distant seem<br/>&gt;&gt; to contribute less or less perceptibly. But it is quite<br/>&gt;&gt; certain that they all do contribute more or less, that of<br/>&gt;&gt; the acoustical emanations of the tone nothing is lost. And<br/>&gt;&gt; it is just as certain that the world of feeling somehow takes<br/>&gt;&gt; into account the entire complex, hence the more distant<br/>&gt;&gt; overtones as well. Even if the analyzing ear does not become<br/>&gt;&gt; conscious of them, they are still heard as tone color. That<br/>&gt;&gt; is to say, here the musical ear does indeed abandon the<br/>&gt;&gt; attempt at exact analysis, but it still takes note of the<br/>&gt;&gt; impression. The more remote overtones are recorded<br/>&gt;&gt; by the subconscious, and when they ascend into the<br/>&gt;&gt; conscious they are analyzed and their relation to the total<br/>&gt;&gt; sound is determined. But this relation is, to repeat, as<br/>&gt;&gt; follows: the more immediate overtones contribute more, the<br/>&gt;&gt; more remote contribute less. Hence, the distinction between<br/>&gt;&gt; them is only a matter of degree, not of kind. They are no<br/>&gt;&gt; more opposites than 2 and 10 are opposites, as the frequency<br/>&gt;&gt; numbers indeed show; and the expressions &quot;consonance&quot; and<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;dissonance&quot;, which signify an antithesis, are false. It all<br/>&gt;&gt; simply depends on the growing ability of the analyzing ear to<br/>&gt;&gt; familiarize itself with the remote overtones, hereby expanding<br/>&gt;&gt; the conception of what is euphonious, suitable for art, so<br/>&gt;&gt; that it embraces the whole natural phenomenon.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; What today is remote can tomorrow be close at hand; it is all<br/>&gt;&gt; a matter of whether one can get closer. And the evolution of<br/>&gt;&gt; music has followed this course: it has drawn into the stock<br/>&gt;&gt; of artistic resources more and more of the harmonic possibilities<br/>&gt;&gt; inherent in the tone.<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; Now if I continue to use the expressions &quot;consonance&quot; and<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;dissonance&quot;, even though they are unwarranted, I do so because<br/>&gt;&gt; there are signs that the evolution of harmony will, in a short<br/>&gt;&gt; time, prove the inadequacy of this classification. The<br/>&gt;&gt; introduction of another terminology at this stage would have<br/>&gt;&gt; no purpose and could hope for little success. Since I still<br/>&gt;&gt; have to operate with these notions, I will define consonances<br/>&gt;&gt; as the closer, simpler relations to the fundamental tone,<br/>&gt;&gt; dissonances as those that are more remote, more complicated.<br/>&gt;&gt; The consonances are accordingly the first overtones, and they<br/>&gt;&gt; are the more nearly perfect the closer they are to the<br/>&gt;&gt; fundamental. That means, the closer they lie to the fundamental,<br/>&gt;&gt; the more easily we can grasp their similarity to it, the more<br/>&gt;&gt; easily the ear can fit them into the total sound and assimilate<br/>&gt;&gt; them, and the more easily we can determine that the sound of<br/>&gt;&gt; these overtones together with the fundamental is &quot;restful&quot;<br/>&gt;&gt; and euphonious, needing no resolution. The same should hold<br/>&gt;&gt; for the dissonances as well. If it does not, if the ability<br/>&gt;&gt; to assimilate the dissonances in use cannot be judged by the<br/>&gt;&gt; same method, if the distance from the fundamental is no measure<br/>&gt;&gt; of the degree of dissonance, this is even so no evidence against<br/>&gt;&gt; the view presented here. For it is harder to gauge these<br/>&gt;&gt; differences precisely, since they are relatively small. They<br/>&gt;&gt; are expressed by fractions with large denominators; and as it<br/>&gt;&gt; requires some thought to say whether 8/234 is larger or smaller<br/>&gt;&gt; than 23/680, because a mere estimate can lead one astray, the<br/>&gt;&gt; mere estimate made by the ear is just as undependable. Efforts<br/>&gt;&gt; to make use of the more remote consonances (today called<br/>&gt;&gt; &quot;dissonances&quot;) as artistic means thus led necessarily to many<br/>&gt;&gt; an error, to many a detour. The way of history, as we can see<br/>&gt;&gt; it in that which has actually been selected by practice from<br/>&gt;&gt; the practicable dissonances, hardly leads here to a correct<br/>&gt;&gt; judgment of the real relations. That assertion is proved by<br/>&gt;&gt; the incomplete or unusual scales of many other peoples, who<br/>&gt;&gt; have, nevertheless, as much right as we to explain them by<br/>&gt;&gt; appeal to nature. Perhaps their tones are often even more<br/>&gt;&gt; natural than ours (that is, more exact, more correct, better);<br/>&gt;&gt; for the tempered system, which is only an expedient for<br/>&gt;&gt; overcoming the difficulties of the material, has indeed only<br/>&gt;&gt; a limited similarity to nature. That is perhaps an advantage,<br/>&gt;&gt; but hardly a mark of superiority.  [_Harmonielehre_ [1911],<br/>&gt;&gt; p 18-20; _Theory of Harmony_, p 20-21.]</p><p>Note that Schoenberg *does* consider the problem of retaining<br/>the use of the terms &quot;consonance&quot; and &quot;dissonance&quot;, and opts<br/>to do so, even while noting that they do not well represent<br/>his conception of the matter.  This is where I think he made<br/>one of his greatest mistakes.  In my opinion, his new ideas<br/>about harmony would have been much better assimilated if he<br/>had indeed introduced new terminology to describe them, instead<br/>of forcing those ideas into the mold of the preconceived notions<br/>about sonance.  *This* is what lies at the bottom of the argument<br/>here between you and I.</p><p>OK, back to quoting mclaren:</p><p>&gt;      It&apos;s so simple and so easy to prove that Schoenberg&apos;s foolish<br/>&gt; claims are false that it&apos;s insulting to even to have descend to this<br/>&gt; kind of kindegarten level to prove these obvious facts. But<br/>&gt; apparently that&apos;s what people like Joe Monzo require -- the<br/>&gt; kindergarten level. So let&apos;s head back to nappy-nap time and show,<br/>&gt; once again, that Schoenberg&apos;s claims about the overtone series are<br/>&gt; foolish and obviously false:<br/>&gt;      Once again, compare the ratio 10/9 with the ratio 8192/6561.<br/>&gt; Sounded as dyads, the first ratio lying low in the overtone series<br/>&gt; sounds grindingly rough, while the second ratio lying high in the<br/>&gt; overtone series sounds smooth and euphonious when played with<br/>&gt; sustained harmonic series timbres. (The ratio 8192/6561 occurs in 12-<br/>&gt; note Pythagorean tuning.)<br/>&gt;     Again, compare the ratio 11/10 with the ratio 19683/16384. Sounded<br/>&gt; as dyads, the first ratio lying low in the overtone series sounds<br/>&gt; gratingly rough, while the second ratio lying high in the overtone<br/>&gt; series sounds  stable and acoustically smooth when played with<br/>&gt; sustained harmonic series timbres. (Again, the ratio 19683/16384<br/>&gt; occurs in the 12-note Pythagorean tuning.)<br/>&gt;     Once again, compare the ratio 13/12 with the ratio 16/13. Played<br/>&gt; as dyads, the first ratio lying low in the overtone series sounds<br/>&gt; rough and harsh while the second ratio lying high in the overtone<br/>&gt; series sounds much smoother when played with sustained harmonic<br/>&gt; series timbres.</p><p>While what you say here is true enough, especially in light of<br/>your own experiements, it&apos;s a ridiculous refutation of what<br/>Schoenberg wrote, because it has nothing to do with any of<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s concepts.  He was thinking of high-limit ratios<br/>as *overtones*, not as ratios _per se_, which is how you present<br/>your argument here.</p><p>So the &quot;dissonances&quot; were always being measured from 1/1<br/>and its &quot;octaves&quot;.  As I pointed out in my original post,<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s categorization of notes as either &quot;consonances&quot;<br/>or &quot;dissonances&quot; depends on the comprehensibility of their<br/>ratios.  So, for example, 13:8 is less comprehensible<br/>(= &quot;more dissonant&quot;) than 7:4, which in turn is less<br/>comprehsible than 3:2.</p><p>And in _Harmonielehre_, he only specifically illustrates<br/>the applicability of his theory up to the 12th partial<br/>(i.e., 11-prime-limit) [Schoenberg 1911, _Harmonielehre_,<br/>p 23; _Theory of Harmony_ p 24-25], and in his later essay<br/>&quot;Problems of Harmony&quot; [Schoenberg [1984], _Style and Idea_,<br/>p 271], up to the 13th (13-prime-limit).  Schoenberg never<br/>wrote anything about any overtones higher than that, or<br/>by implication, about any ratios involving higher primes.</p><p>So it&apos;s quite pointless to invoke ratios like 8192/6561 or<br/>19683/16384 here.  Sure, they occur in Pythagorean tuning, but<br/>what does that have to do with Schoenberg or the audible<br/>overtone series?  Not a thing.</p><p>&gt;      So the larger point here is that Schoenberg was triply ignorant<br/>&gt; and triply arrogant and triply incompetent -- not only did Schoenberg<br/>&gt; make a fool of himself by parrotting the antique and long-disproven<br/>&gt; Rameauvian superstition that musical consonance is defined by<br/>&gt; position in the overtone series, Schoenberg also made a foolish<br/>&gt; blunder in equating acoustic roughness with the much larger and<br/>&gt; much more complex  issue of overall musical dissonance,<br/>&gt; and Schoenberg made an even more foolish and more ignorant<br/>&gt; blunder in failing to recognize that musical consonance consists of<br/>&gt; 2 separate components -- acoustic roughness and musical context.</p><p>I&apos;m of the opinion that Schoenberg&apos;s compositional practice<br/>refutes what you say here.  He was well aware that dissonance<br/>is a function of musical context, and *his* style after 1907<br/>recognized these &quot;more remote relationships&quot; as consonances<br/>while the rest of the *theoretical* world continued to view<br/>them as dissonances.</p><p>Please note that one of the reasons why Schoenberg felt justified<br/>in taking this path was that the compositions of other composers<br/>whom he admired (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Mahler, etc.),<br/>boldly used &quot;dissonant&quot; notes in ways that broke the rules<br/>that were published in the theory books.  Schoenberg points<br/>these instances out again and again; for example,</p><p>Bach [_Harmonielehre [1911], p 363, 367; _Theory of Harmony_, p 324, 327]<br/>Mozart [_Harmonielehre [1911], p 363; _Theory of Harmony_, p 324]<br/>Mahler [_Harmonielehre [1911], p 372; _Theory of Harmony_, p 330]</p><p>And without mentioning Beethoven, Schoenberg illustrates the<br/>clashing harmonies resulting from using scales in contrary<br/>motion, as Beethoven did in several of his pieces (for one instance,<br/>measures 134-143 in the 2nd movement of his 5th Symphony, op. 67.)<br/>[_Harmonielehre [1911], p 360; _Theory of Harmony_, p 322.]</p><p>&gt;      In each case Schoenberg&apos;s arrogant claims reflect his ignorance<br/>&gt; of the actual sound and function of members of the overtone series as<br/>&gt; well as Schoenberg&apos;s basic incompetence as a musician. Any competent<br/>&gt; musician realizes that musical consonance is not the same thing as<br/>&gt; acoustic roughness...but Schoenberg&apos;s effort to equate dissonance<br/>&gt; with position in the overtone series utterly and completely ignores<br/>&gt; this basic fact. By foolislhly and ignorantly equating musical<br/>&gt; consonance with position in the overtone series Schoenberg by<br/>&gt; definition ignored the musical context in which the interval occurs.<br/>&gt; No surprise. He was too arrogant  and too ignorant of the subjects he<br/>&gt; discussed and too incompetent as a musician and as a scholar to be<br/>&gt; able to even the simplest rudiments of elementary musicianship into<br/>&gt; account in his so-called &quot;theory.&quot;  (Acutally not theory at all, but<br/>&gt; idle numerological speculation which systematically conflicts with<br/>&gt; everyday facts readily apparent to competent musicians.)  In fact,<br/>&gt; since Schoenberg never even bothered to audibly observe the overtone<br/>&gt; series, his claims cannot even be called &quot;theories,&quot; for theories<br/>&gt; derive from observation and get tested against the real world.<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s claims about the overtone series are not theories,<br/>&gt; they&apos;re mere delusions and hallucinations, derived from nothing, and<br/>&gt; never tested against anything -- the musical equivalent of Dianetics.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     There is, of course,  no evidence that Schoenberg ever bothered<br/>&gt; to tune up the members of the overtone series and listen to their<br/>&gt; various combinations. This why Schoenberg made his laughable and<br/>&gt; pervasively  false claims about the overtone series -- because<br/>&gt; Schoenberg never actually heard the harmonic series intervals he<br/>&gt; pontificated about in his &quot;Harmonielehre.&quot;  Accordingly, the book<br/>&gt; should actually be called &quot;Harmonielacheln.&quot;</p><p>For the non-German readers, that&apos;s a pun on &quot;teacher&quot; and &quot;laughter&quot;.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     This explains why Schoenberg&apos;s statements about the overtone<br/>&gt; series are so ignorant.  It&apos;s because Schoenberg was ignorant. He was<br/>&gt; ignorant of the sound of the pitches and intervals taken from the<br/>&gt; overtone series because there is no evidence that Schoenberg ever<br/>&gt; bothered to tune  them up and listen to them.  There is not the<br/>&gt; slightest shred of hard  proof to show that Schoenberg ever lifted<br/>&gt; even one finger to listen  to the overtone-series intervals he<br/>&gt; pontificated about -- that&apos;s called &quot;ignorance.&quot;<br/>&gt; ... &lt;snip&gt; ...<br/>&gt;    For if a person is so overweening as to make pronouncements about<br/>&gt; musical intervals he has never heard, there&apos;s a word for that,<br/>&gt; kiddies  --  that&apos;s  called &quot;arrogance.&quot;  Lastly, we may note as a<br/>&gt; matter of simple  ordinary common sense that a person who has never<br/>&gt; *heard* intervals in the overtone series by definition cannot be<br/>&gt; competent in their manipulation.  And when a person is not competent,<br/>&gt; there&apos;s a word for that too -- that&apos;s called &quot;incompetence.&quot;</p><p>Based on my (at this point, quite deep) study of Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>work from the beginning to c. 1913, I&apos;ve come to the conclusion<br/>that he had a fantastically perceptive ear.  It&apos;s true that<br/>he never tuned any instruments up to hear the rational intervals<br/>as actual pitches, but he spoke enough about manipulating<br/>overtones (_klangfarbenmelodie_, &quot;tone-color melody&quot;) that<br/>it&apos;s obvious that he could hear the overtones in music played<br/>even in (nominal) 12-tET [See the end of his book, _Harmonielehre_<br/>[1911], p 470-471; _Theory of Harmony_, p 421-422].  And he<br/>actually composed a famous experiment based on this idea in<br/>the 3rd piece of his _F&iuml;&iquest;&half;nf Orchesterst&iuml;&iquest;&half;cke_, op. 16.</p><p>So there&apos;s no doubt in my mind at all that he did actually<br/>hear rational intervals, in the form of overtones up to<br/>about the 11th or 13th.  This is not fantasy... I&apos;ve clearly<br/>heard overtones up to the 11th in tuning the low strings<br/>on a piano.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &quot;Schoenberg was proud of never having studied a history of<br/>&gt; music, of never having worked through a textbook on the theory<br/>&gt; of music. &grave;That is too dull for me.&apos; [Schoenberg, Harmonielehre,<br/>&gt; 1911, pg. 350] It apprently never occured to Schoenberg that it<br/>&gt; is imputed to have published a Theory of Harmony of 470 pages in<br/>&gt; which one...tells the reader that eht author himself would never<br/>&gt; condescend to read a similar treatise for by anyone else. (..)<br/>&gt; The fact that New Music developed this way is due, in the final<br/>&gt; analysis, to the inadequate theoretical knowledge of the main<br/>&gt; protagonists. Schoenerbg&apos;s words: At such times I regret athat I know<br/>&gt; so little are pairseworthy for their honesty but they indicate that<br/>&gt; whole sorry state which existed at the time.&quot; [Vogel, Martin,<br/>&gt; &quot;On the Relations of Tone,&quot; Orpheus: Bonn, 1993, pp. 297-298]</p><p>And Vogel has *his* own points to prove against Schoenberg,<br/>by also taking Schoenberg&apos;s words out of context and misinterpreting<br/>them.  Reading Vogel&apos;s work on Schoenberg must be done with a<br/>*very* critical eye.</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt;     And so, as usual, we see the hallmarks of Schoenberg&apos;s writings<br/>&gt; and his ideas -- arrogance combined with ignorance and incompetence.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      Any competent musician realizes that the exact same chord or<br/>&gt; interval in one musical context can function as a relative consonance,<br/>&gt; while functioning as a relative musical dissonance in another musical<br/>&gt; context.  Any competent musician realizes this...but Schoenberg<br/>&gt; didn&apos;t, as evidenced so clearly by Schoenberg&apos;s own words:<br/>&gt; &quot;The dissonances are consonances which as overtones are more<br/>&gt; remotely situated.&quot; [Schoenberg, Arnold, &quot;Harmonielehre,&quot; 1911, pg.<br/>&gt; 356]<br/>&gt;     Schoenberg made this foolishly false statement not just once, but<br/>&gt; several times, because Schoenberg was too arrogant and far too<br/>&gt; ignorant of the distinction between acoustical roughness and musical<br/>&gt; dissonance and far to incompetent as a musician to understand the<br/>&gt; difference.</p><p>&gt;     Schoenberg&apos;s faulty and ignorant claims about the supposed<br/>&gt; relation between dissonance and the overtone series are typically<br/>&gt; foolish and typically uninformed.  Here, as so often throughout<br/>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s arrogant ignorant incompetent writings, we see the<br/>&gt; penalty Schoenberg paid for not having bothered to obtain a genuine<br/>&gt; musical education from experts. Schoenberg constantly makes ignorant<br/>&gt; and foolish claims about music which had been dismissed with laughter<br/>&gt; and disproven long before Schoenberg&apos;s time.</p><p>You are correct that Schoenberg boasted of &quot;never having read<br/>a harmony textbook&quot;, etc.  But at the same time, his perceptive<br/>ears and mind noticed things about music (especially harmony)<br/>that hadn&apos;t been noticed by those before him who had been blinded<br/>by what they learned.</p><p>I know very well of what I speak here.  I&apos;ve stated publicly<br/>many times what a revelation it was to me to read (and understand)<br/>Partch&apos;s book, precisely *because* I had had such a thorough<br/>training in music... a training which, while thorough in many<br/>other ways, completely ignored anything having to do with tuning.</p><p>&gt; ... it is in equal parts pathetic and laughable to<br/>&gt; see Schoenberg parrotting this kind of ludicrous 18th-century<br/>&gt; pseudo-science at the late late *late* date of 1911:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;    &quot;Schoenberg derived the diatonic scale, our major key, from the<br/>&gt; overtones 1-11 of three overtone-series related by fifths. (..) The b<br/>&gt; was the seventh overtone of c. Schoenberg used the 11th overtone of<br/>&gt; c for F-sharp/g-flat, even though he had given it as f in his<br/>&gt; derivation of the diatonic scale. In fact, the 11th overtone of c is<br/>&gt; neither an f for an F-sharp, at 551 cents it lies in the middle<br/>&gt; between these chromatic degrees. It is thus just as unsuited for<br/>&gt; derivation of the chromatic scale, as the 13th overtone, which<br/>&gt; likewise leads to quartertones.&quot; [Vogel, Martin, &quot;On the Relations of<br/>&gt; Tone,&quot; trans. Vincent Jean Kisselbach, Orpheus: Bonn, 1993, pg.<br/>&gt; 295]</p><p>This is essentially the same negative analysis of Schoenberg&apos;s idea<br/>which Partch wrote [_Genesis of a Music_, 2nd ed., p 418].</p><p>&gt;     At this point it behooves everyone to notice that the attack dogs<br/>&gt; on this discussion group have produced no music recently, and they<br/>&gt; have not yet released even one (1) single CD of their music between<br/>&gt; them.<br/>&gt;      Joe Monzo has produced no CDs of his music, and of course John<br/>&gt; deLaubenfels has produced no CDs of his music.</p><p>In fact I have produced a CD of my music, but it&apos;s still not finished<br/>to my liking and so I haven&apos;t yet released it.</p><p>And please don&apos;t refer to me as an &quot;attack dog&quot;, even if you&apos;re<br/>lumping me in with two other people.  I&apos;m a pacifist, and I consider<br/>your epithet to be an insult.  And you know me personally as a<br/>friend and know the way I am, which makes it more insulting to me.<br/>I do not attack people, and never would.  I simply try to point out<br/>what seems to me to be a misunderstanding or an error.</p><p>(For that matter, since you *do* know me well, I bristle when<br/>I see you publicly proclaiming that I am &quot;lying&quot;.  I don&apos;t do<br/>that even in ephemeral everyday situations -- i.e., when the vast<br/>majority of other people *would* lie -- and I certainly would never<br/>knowingly propogate false information in an archived public forum.<br/>The differences in our opinions on Schoenberg boil down to a matter<br/>of interpretation.)</p><p>&gt;       Meanwhile, I continue to produce CDs of my music. My latest CD,<br/>&gt; now more than halfway finished, continues toward completion at a<br/>&gt; rapid pace.  By contrast, neither of three attack dogs on this<br/>&gt; discussion have produced any music lately as far as anyone can<br/>&gt; discern.<br/>&gt;      While I continue to upload works in progress, Joe Monzo has<br/>&gt; uploaded nothing lately.</p><p>Excuse me, but you really make yourself look foolish by saying stuff<br/>like this without first visiting my website.</p><p>I put new music there every week, and have been for nearly three years.<br/>If it is in need of any apology, I&apos;ll just say to you that much of it<br/>is my rendition of other people&apos;s music, and much of my own stuff is<br/>in the dreaded 12-tET, but I *am* producing actual music on a regular<br/>basis, and I make it all public... and free of charge, I might add.</p><p>&gt;     No wonder Joe Monzo and John deLaubenfels have composed no new<br/>&gt; music in the last few weeks. They have no time to compose music. All<br/>&gt; their time is taken up by frantic and desperate efforts to square the<br/>&gt; cube and defend the indefensible.</p><p>I found this to be *really* amusing, because *just the night before<br/>I read it* I composed a brand-new choral piece (inspired by Margo Schulter&apos;s<br/>recent MIDI-file &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/20tgz002.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/20tgz002.mid</a>&gt;) in 12-tET<br/>and sent it to John deLaubenfels to hear what retunings he could come<br/>up with!</p><p>&gt;     Like prelates of Galileo&apos;s time who wasted their lives in a<br/>&gt; desperate effort to &quot;prove&quot; by study of the Holy Scriptures that the<br/>&gt; sun actually orbits the earth (in blatant contradiction of all<br/>&gt; Galileo&apos;s telescopic observations, viz., the phases of Venus), the<br/>&gt; latter-day musical prelates Joe Monzo and John DeLaubenfels waste<br/>&gt; their lives in a near-hysterical effort to conjure out of existence<br/>&gt; by elaborate and incoherent arguments the masssive errors and<br/>&gt; obviously audible fallacies of their respective cult leaders --<br/>&gt; Arnold Schoenberg and Hermann Helmholtz.</p><p>*I* hardly view Schoenberg as a cult leader, even tho that *is*<br/>essentially what he became.  To me, he was simply a brilliant<br/>mind and extraordinarily talented composer, much like his friend<br/>and my real idol, Mahler.  Fortunately, Mahler never wrote a<br/>damn word about theory, so I think he&apos;s safe from mclaren attacks.</p><p>&gt;     Standard stuff. It&apos;s an old story.  On every discussion group,<br/>&gt; there are always a bunch of do-nothing know-nothing people who never<br/>&gt; create -- they only destroy. They can&apos;t build up, they can only tear<br/>&gt; down. They can&apos;t generate anything, they can only harp and carp and<br/>&gt; shriek lies and innuendos and demonstrably false canards in praise of<br/>&gt; long-bypassed kooks like Schoenberg whom no serious musician<br/>&gt; takes seriously nowadays.<br/>&gt;      Like cockroaches or bad weather, characters like these will<br/>&gt; always be with us. People who never create, never generate anything,<br/>&gt; never have much time to produce new music...only meaningless words<br/>&gt; backed up by nothing  but vague rambling claims and unsupported<br/>&gt; hysterical outbursts.</p><p>If I wasn&apos;t able to blow this off easily as &quot;just another mclaren rant&quot;<br/>(which I am), I&apos;d be insulted by this too.</p><p>Anyone on the planet who has access to the internet (several million<br/>people is my guess) can see and hear that I have created a tremendous<br/>amount of music, whether new (my own) or old (my new versions of other<br/>people&apos;s) and essays about music which are filled to the brim with<br/>citations and references.</p><p>In the past, to my face, you yourself, Brian, have complimented me<br/>on my scholarship, calling me &quot;one of the few real scholars writing<br/>about microtonal music&quot;.  So it&apos;s easy for me to flush this one...</p><p>And why, when *you* get upset by something I write, do you<br/>characterize my calm (possibly even *boring*) prose as an<br/>&quot;hysterical outburst&quot;?!  Look at your *own* response, right here!!</p><p>&gt;     Typical of the low low standards of scholarship of the attack<br/>&gt; dogs on this discussion list, the interested observer might query Joe<br/>&gt; Monzo as to how many scholarly citations he posted in his futile<br/>&gt; effort to support Schoenberg&apos;s insupportable ignorance and<br/>&gt; incompetence.<br/>&gt;     Well, Joe didn&apos;t make any citations in his post attacking me for<br/>&gt; my alleged &quot;lack of knowledge&quot; of Schoenberg&apos;s claims.<br/>&gt;     And where are the citations from Schoenberg&apos;s own writings proving<br/>&gt; that &quot;schoenberg never said that&quot; as Joe Monzo ignorantly and falasely<br/>&gt; claims?<br/>&gt;     Well, Joe didn&apos;t put in any citations from Schoenberg in his post<br/>&gt; attacking me for my supposed &quot;lack of knowledge&quot; of Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>&gt; ideas.<br/>&gt;     So what have we got here?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Joe has no evidence and no scholarly citations and no facts and no<br/>&gt; musical examples to prove his case. All Joe has is a bunch of<br/>&gt; meaningless vague insults to try to save the already ruined<br/>&gt; reputation of his dead debunked false idol Arnold Schoenberg.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;   What we&apos;ve got here is a guy named Joe Monzo who claims &quot;Brian, you<br/>&gt; dismiss Schoenberg&apos;s theories without apparently having taken the<br/>&gt; time to really grapple with his ideas and understand him fully&quot; yet<br/>&gt; Joe Monzo himself does not even know what Arnold Schoenberg said.<br/>&gt; Joe Monzo claims that I am ignorant yet I produce vast numbers of<br/>&gt; citations documenting my statements of proven fact...meanwhile, Joe<br/>&gt; Monzo produces no citations of any kind, no proof, no hard evidence,<br/>&gt; nothing whatsoever other than his vague and pervasively false fuzzy-<br/>&gt; wuzzy maunderings about Schoenberg.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Typical.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Just as Arnold Schoenberg&apos;s claims are characterized by arrogance<br/>&gt; combined with ignorance and incompetence, Schoenberg&apos;s defenders<br/>&gt; reveal themselves as arrogant and ignorant of what Schoenberg actually<br/>&gt; said and believed and incompetent as scholars as well as<br/>&gt; psycoacousticians and mathematicians and physicists and acousticians<br/>&gt; when they try to defend Schoenberg&apos;s indefensibly foolish claims.</p><p>Again, I wasn&apos;t intending to &quot;attack&quot; you, merely to helpfully<br/>point out what I perceive as misunderstandings in your knowledge<br/>of Schoenberg&apos;s theory.</p><p>OK, so that other post was simply a &quot;quickie&quot; response to you, which<br/>I see is something I should *never* do when responding unfavorably<br/>to you, because you&apos;re lying in wait with your collection of<br/>fat tomes and butcher knives.  Hopefully you&apos;re satisfied with<br/>the scholarly work I&apos;ve put into this one.</p><p>Well, at least you&apos;ll let me get away with *complimenting* you<br/>with &quot;kind words&quot; without going thru all the academic bullshit.  :)</p><p>&gt;     You want to &quot;grapple with [Schoenberg&apos;s] ideas,&quot; Joe?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Good. Let&apos;s grapple.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Schoenberg claims that dissonance depends on how &quot;remote...in the<br/>&gt; series of overtones&quot; the musical interval is [Schoenberg, op. cit.,<br/>&gt; 1956]  These are Schoenberg&apos;s own words and as demonstrated they are<br/>&gt; pervasively and foolishly false.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Schoenberg ineptly tries to explain this supposed relationship<br/>&gt; between remoteness in the overtone series (AKA height in the overtone<br/>&gt; series) and musical dissonance by the faulty claim that consonances<br/>&gt; are  more comprehensible musical relationships which dissonances are<br/>&gt; less comprehensibel musical relationships. (As always, Joe Monzo will<br/>&gt; deny this, and when he does he&apos;ll be lying. As always, I look forward<br/>&gt; to proving it.)   But this boils down to the foolishly false claim<br/>&gt; that music is nothing more than communication -- those aspects of<br/>&gt; music which communicate with difficulty are less comprehensible and<br/>&gt; therefore dissonant, according to Schoenberg&apos;s obviously false claim,<br/>&gt; while those aspects of music which communicate easily are more<br/>&gt; comprehensible and therefore consonant.  (As always, Joe Monzo will<br/>&gt; deny this, and when he does he&apos;ll be lying. As always I look forward<br/>&gt; to proving it. As always, I have citations in Schoenberg&apos;s own words<br/>&gt; proving my statements of documented fact.)</p><p>Brian, you&apos;re really twisting Schoenberg&apos;s words here.<br/>Yes, I&apos;m denying what you say and, no, I&apos;m not lying.</p><p>Schoenberg does not say anything about music being communication.<br/>And he does not say that &quot;those aspects of music which communicate<br/>with difficulty are less comprehensible and therefore dissonant&quot;.<br/>What he *does* say is that the intervals that *other* people<br/>consider to be dissonant, and which are represented by the higher<br/>overtones, are merely (to him) &quot;the more remote consonances&quot;.<br/>There&apos;s quite a difference between that and what you seem to<br/>understand him to have written.  No need for further citations here...<br/>it&apos;s all in the big quote I gave above [_Harmonielehre_ [1911],<br/>p 18-20; _Theory of Harmony_, p 20-21.].</p><p>&gt;     But music is not communication. Music has nothing to do with<br/>&gt; communication. Music involves emotions and wordless evocative<br/>&gt; impressions.  This is not communication, it&apos;s art.</p><p>I think you&apos;re drawing false distinctions here.  You&apos;re *assuming*<br/>that it&apos;s *always* the case that &quot;people communicate in order to<br/>learn and to motive [_sic_, motivate] others to act&quot;, and it just<br/>ain&apos;t so.</p><p>Some people communicate simply because they&apos;re compulsive<br/>communicators and for no other reason (hasn&apos;t everyone here<br/>known at least one person who simply would never shut up?).<br/>Sometimes people communicate because they need to &quot;blow off steam&quot;,<br/>and don&apos;t give a rat&apos;s ass about education or motivation.<br/>And there are plenty of people who communicate because it&apos;s<br/>their way of wielding and/or manipulating power.  Some<br/>communicate because it&apos;s their way of earning a living.<br/>And so on and on and on and on...</p><p>And some of *them* use music to do their communicating.</p><p>&gt;     Bottom line?<br/>&gt;     Schoenberg is a pimple on the ass of music. Schoenberg is a turd<br/>&gt; in a flaming paper bag on the doorstep of music history, and it is<br/>&gt; demeaning even to step on him in order to put the fire out.</p><p>So the bottom line is you can&apos;t stand Schoenberg&apos;s guts.</p><p>You should therefore correspond with Neil Haverstick about him<br/>... you two would have a ball tearing apart his work.</p><p>Me, I like Schoenberg&apos;s music and his theory, and find it to be<br/>a deep and intriguing universe with its own unique kind of logic.</p><p>So unless you&apos;re prepared to reevaluate your ideas about<br/>Schoenberg&apos;s work based on what I&apos;ve written here, I&apos;m finished<br/>corresponding with *you* about *him* (at least in public).</p><p>If you have any interest in pursuing my ideas about Schoenberg<br/>further, please consult my future books, papers, webpages, etc.<br/>on the subject.  Also, I&apos;ve already written a ton of stuff<br/>about aspects of tuning in Schoenberg&apos;s work to the Tuning List,<br/>which is in the searchable list archives:<br/><a href="/tuning/messages">/tuning/messages</a></p><p>That should take care of that.  And anyway, it&apos;s off-topic<br/>for this list, so no more about it from me here.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=282 href="#282">ðŸ”—</a>Rick McGowan &#x3C;rick@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2001 7:50:34 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; So just skip it if you&apos;re not interested.</p><p>Already skipped it, thanks.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
