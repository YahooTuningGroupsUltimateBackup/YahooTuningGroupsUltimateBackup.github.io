He<br/>ordered his driver to stop and he got out to investigate.  &quot;Why are you<br/>eating grass?&quot; he asked one man.</p><p>&quot;We don&apos;t have any money for food,&quot; the poor man replied.  &quot;Oh, come  along<br/>with me then,&quot; instructed the conservative.  &quot;But, sir, I have a wife<br/>and  two children!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Bring them along!&quot; replied the wealthy one. He turned to the other man and<br/>said, &quot;Come with us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But sir, I have a wife and six children!&quot; the second man answered.</p><p>&quot;Bring them as well!&quot; answered his compassionateness as he headed for<br/>his  limo.</p><p>They all climbed into the car, which was no easy task, even for a car  as<br/>large as the limo.  Once underway, one of the poor fellows said, &quot;Sir, you<br/>are too kind.  Thank you for taking all of us with you.&quot;</p><p>The Compassionate One replied, &quot;No problem. I fired my gardener 3 weeks ago<br/>and the grass at my  home is almost a foot tall.&quot;</p></div>
