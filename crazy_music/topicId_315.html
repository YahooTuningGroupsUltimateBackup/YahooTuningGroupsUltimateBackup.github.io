Like Josef Goebbels shrieking that &quot;Jews<br/>&gt; are destroying the sacred Fatherland!&quot; when in fact the only people<br/>&gt; destroying Germany in the 1930s were Nazi thugs like Goebbels,<br/>&gt; John deLaubenfels makes hypocrisy into an art form.  Standard<br/>&gt; practice for consummate liars like deLaubenfels.</p><p>Godwin&apos;s Law</p><p>&gt;      We have heard this kind of plaintive wail before. We have<br/>&gt; heard it from Nazis gut-shot during the Jewish uprising the Warsaw<br/>&gt; Ghetto. Those SS officers, who lay on the ground moaning in agony<br/>&gt; and drenched in their own blood, uttered the same wails of<br/>&gt; disbelief and outrage -- ooohh, how terrible, those violent Jews,<br/>&gt; look how vicious they are to shoot at us!<br/>&gt;      Verdammte Judenschwein!<br/>&gt;      The gall of those Jews, when all we wanted to do was herd them<br/>&gt; into gas chambers and turn their skin into lampshades.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      There exists, no doubt, some twisted state of dementia according<br/>&gt; to which Jews who shot down SS goons are criminals perpetrating<br/>&gt; horrible violence, and in which the blackshirted thugs become<br/>&gt; poor helpless victims brutalized by those monstrous subhuman<br/>&gt; Judenschwein.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      But such a state of dementia is so sick, so twisted, so<br/>&gt; contrary to common human decency and ordinary common sense, that<br/>&gt; it can have no bearing on our discussion here on this tuning forum.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;      With this, John deLaubenfels has reached the nadir of human<br/>&gt; cowardice. With this post (&quot;Is this how you want to be remembered<br/>&gt; after you&apos;re gone?&quot; --  John deLaubenfels, Message 6 Digest 34)<br/>&gt; criticizing me for my unmitigated gall in daring to defend myself<br/>&gt; against his attempted verbal sodomies, John deLaubenfels has plumbed<br/>&gt; the nethermost depths of hypocrisy and guile.</p><p>Godwin&apos;s Law</p><p>                   Graham</p></div>
