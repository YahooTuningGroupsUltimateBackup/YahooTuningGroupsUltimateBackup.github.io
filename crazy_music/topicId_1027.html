I guess I&apos;m going with Lycos unless somebody<br/>&gt; has a better idea...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Any better, or different ideas to try?<br/>&gt; --Dan Stearns</p><p>Yikes! That sounds like a bunch of cool music. I know you shut down<br/>your station on <a href="http://mp3.com">mp3.com</a>. Is there a reason you can&apos;t put them there,<br/>othere than the long lead time?</p><p>John Starrett</p></div><h3><a id=1033 href="#1033">ðŸ”—</a>X. J.

(Hey Darreg is quoted in the list charter as<br/>&gt; saying there are no bad tunings, right... okay, sorry, it&apos;s<br/>&gt; brief... I won&apos;t do it again... etc.)</p><p>Wow Dan, you rock!</p><p>That brings up an interesting philosophical question of<br/>whether you should be allowed to call that 12tET.</p><p>I mean, if we allow that to happen then we might as<br/>well just call any tuning we happen to be using<br/>whatever we want. :-)</p><p>&gt; Remember that the drummer was a 15-year-old kid who had never<br/>&gt; really heard much of any jazz per se, and note how he kind of<br/>&gt; winds up taking an uptempo swing beat like a breakdancing<br/>&gt; Texas two-step, or a krakowiak (on crack) or something...<br/>&gt; perfect!</p><p>Are you the drummer or the guitarist? The<br/>guitar reminds me of your work for some reason.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
