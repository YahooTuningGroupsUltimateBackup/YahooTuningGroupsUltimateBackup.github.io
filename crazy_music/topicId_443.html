The Feral Child from the wilderness of North<br/>&gt; Carolina.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have just uploaded a new piece to our files section to commemorate<br/>&gt; the one year anniversary of the presentation of my Prime Scales, for<br/>&gt; which I was summarily crucified on the ATL (Alternative Wankin&apos; List<br/>&gt; in mclaren speak).</p><p>Have to admit that that crucifiction was positively mild compared to<br/>what we&apos;ve seen since! (Post lists of large prime numbers here<br/>and you&apos;ll have your head handed you on a platter).</p><p>&gt; Only three people got it out of 450 - Mary Beth<br/>&gt; Ackerley (who has written some awesome music with these scales!),<br/>&gt; Margo Schulter and Joseph Pehrson. i</p><p>Not everyone tries every scale that is posted. I&apos;ve tried Dan<br/>Stearns, since he seemed to be pursuing a similar thread to one<br/>I&apos;d been chasing. I tried 34 and 29, somehow bumping into them<br/>via some of Margos posts. I recently was swimming around in<br/>7 and 14 tet after a post on this list managed to reach out of<br/>the screen and shake a fist in my face.</p><p>You can&apos;t take lack of response personally (any more than you<br/>should take an over-enthusiastic-whether-positive-or-negative<br/>response).</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div>
