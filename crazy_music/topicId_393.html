And they don&apos;t.</p><p>Schoenberg *never* made any scientific claims whatsoever.<br/>He insisted himself that what he presented in _Harmonielehre_<br/>would not even hold up to scrutiny as a &quot;theory&quot;, and referred<br/>to it simply as a &quot;method&quot;.  His primary aim in this book was<br/>to teach his students basic Euro-style harmony and to suggest<br/>some possible new directions based on evolution from those<br/>techniques.  He was, first and foremost, a creative artist.</p><p>In this regard, I find it extremely unfortunate that the<br/>only available English translations (the abridged one of<br/>Robert D. W. Adams from 1948 and the complete one of Roy E.<br/>Carter from 1978) were both given the title &quot;Theory of Harmony&quot;<br/>by the translators.  In my opinion, &quot;Treatise on Harmony&quot;<br/>probably would have been the best way to render &quot;Harmonielehre&quot;<br/>into English, especially considering Schoenberg&apos;s insistence<br/>that he was not writing theory.</p><p>&gt; Schoenberg&apos;s claims about the overtone series and about the<br/>&gt; alleged &quot;evolution&quot; of music are pervasively and demonstrably<br/>&gt; false, as countless modern musicologists and composers and<br/>&gt; music historians have pointed out.</p><p>And, as Schoenberg himself said, might turn out to be the case.<br/>So why are you beating this dead horse?</p><p>&gt; By throwing out tonality and discarding established categories<br/>&gt; of sensory consonance, Schoenberg produced complete syntactic<br/>&gt; breakdown.  Without tonality and without traditional categories<br/>&gt; of sensory consonance established by hundreds of years of<br/>&gt; composers&apos; intuition and audience feedback, nothing was left<br/>&gt; to organize music but private codes like serialism.</p><p>Schoenberg did not &quot;throw out tonality&quot;, and never claimed<br/>to do so.  In fact he detested the label &quot;atonality&quot; that the<br/>reviewers and critics slapped on his post-1907 compositions.<br/>He preferred to think of it as &quot;pantonality&quot;.  It would do<br/>you well to think deeply about the difference, and about<br/>the fact that the man himself had this attitude.</p><p>&gt;       As a result, Schoenberg&apos;s music sounds boring and trivial,<br/>&gt; it lacks audible organization, and the audiences hears only<br/>&gt; incoherent spatters of notes and spasmodic random-sounding<br/>&gt; dissonances.</p><p>This is *your* personal opinion and the response of *some*<br/>(perhaps even *most*) listeners in any given random sample.<br/>It is *not* a &quot;fact&quot;, for which your presentation here might<br/>easily allow a reader to mistake it.</p><p>When I listen to a good performance of Schoenberg&apos;s music,<br/>I am his audience, and I hear coherent motivic organization<br/>and harmonic structures spanning the entire gamut from<br/>mellow consonances to spasmodic random-sounding dissonances,<br/>which I perceive as giving his compositions a range of<br/>emotional expression far wider than anything composed before him.</p><p>(Also, please keep in mind that when I discuss my love<br/>for Schoenberg&apos;s compositions, I&apos;m speaking specifically<br/>of his early work c. 1893-1913 and his latest pieces post-1946.<br/>I too never really cared much for his serial pieces from<br/>the 1920-1945 period, with a few notable exceptions.)</p><p>&gt; By ignoring these basic human limits, Schoenberg proved<br/>&gt; himself arrogant as well as ignorant and incompetent.</p><p>Why not instead say that &quot;By ignoring these basic human<br/>limits, Schoenberg was branching out into a totally new<br/>type of compositional procedure that bears no relation<br/>to anything any composer before him had dared to try&quot;.</p><p>My version seems to me to be just as valid as yours.</p><p>&gt;     If Schoenberg&apos;s method doesn&apos;t work, then he has<br/>&gt; failed to show that the Western diatonic scale<br/>&gt; derives from the overtone series.</p><p>And again, he referred to it as &quot;the possibly incorrect<br/>overtone theory&quot;.  Dead horse.</p><p>&gt; And that means<br/>&gt; that Schoenberg can no longer legitimately make an analogy<br/>&gt; between overtones and pitches in the Western scale.<br/>&gt;     With that, Schoenberg&apos;s entire claim about the &quot;emancipation<br/>&gt; of the dissonance&quot; breaks down and collapses, revealed<br/>&gt; as self-contradictory nonsense, since no causal connection can<br/>&gt; be established any longer between the overtone series<br/>&gt; and the pitches of the Western 12-tone scale.</p><p>I don&apos;t (and won&apos;t) see it that way.  Schoenberg was very<br/>careful all thru _Harmonielehre_ to say that 12-tET is an<br/>*imperfect compromise*.</p><p>He did entertain the possibility of using microtonal scales,<br/>and rejected them simply because post-1907 he was getting<br/>very negative reviews from the newspaper critics (who, it<br/>must be remembered, represent only a tiny segment of the<br/>total potential listening audience, but who wield enormous<br/>power over influencing a large portion of that audience),<br/>and he certainly felt that it would be counterproductive to<br/>compose his new music for instruments that did not even exist<br/>and scales with which only a tiny minority of musicians in<br/>his time and place had any familiarity.</p><p>It&apos;s important to realize that Schoenberg&apos;s only means of<br/>income at this time in his life was from his handful of<br/>students and the meager royalties and fees he received from<br/>his compositions.  He would certainly reject microtonality<br/>on the grounds that it would have had a severely negative<br/>impact on his ability to survive.</p><p>&gt;     What&apos;s wrong is that when a person uses the language<br/>&gt; of science and the trappings of science without using<br/>&gt; the methods of science, then that person is practicing<br/>&gt; pseudo-science.</p><p>Brian, now I challenge you.  Please cite, from Schoenberg&apos;s<br/>own writings, every instance you can find where he &quot;uses the<br/>language of science and the trappings of science&quot;.  I&apos;ve<br/>studied his work in great detail, and never found that.</p><p>He employed the &quot;possibly incorrect overtone theory&quot; as<br/>an *analogy* to what he perceived in standard harmonic<br/>practice, and to suggest possibilities for expansion of<br/>that practice, and he stated this explicitly.</p><p>&gt;     Pseudo-science is nothing but a form of con artistry.<br/>&gt; Accordingly Schoenberg was nothing but a con artist, and<br/>&gt; not a very bright one.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     Klaus Schmirler&apos;s claim is false on its face that<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     &quot;...every theory, even Helmholtz&apos;s, is a legitimate theory<br/>&gt; if it can serve as a starting point for its revision&quot;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;     According to this logic, astrology served as the starting<br/>&gt; point for astronomy. Therefore astrology is a legitimate<br/>&gt; theory. Therefore we would teach astrology in the universities<br/>&gt; and give university degrees in astrology.</p><p>So teaching something in a university is your criterion for<br/>determining whether something is a &quot;legitimate theory&quot;?<br/>Then that makes all that crap 12-tET serialist stuff that&apos;s<br/>been hacked out in American universities for 50 years legitimate.</p><p>Why not teach astrology in universities?  Would there be something<br/>wrong with that?  Perhaps then we&apos;d be able to find out *why*<br/>so many millions of people all over the world put so much faith<br/>in it.</p><p>&gt;     In fact, an American TV commercial several years ago<br/>&gt; shows the American attitude toward expressionism.<br/>&gt;     In this American TV commercial, the red screaming<br/>&gt; figure from &quot;The Scream&quot; stands in an animated sunset<br/>&gt; howling silently in horror.  Then a Buick pulls up.<br/>&gt; The howling figure suddenly smiles, whips on a pair of<br/>&gt; sunglasses, and drives off in the Buick into the sunset<br/>&gt; in a landscape which has suddenly turned into bright<br/>&gt; cheerful pastel colors.<br/>&gt;     The animation for this TV commercial was done in the<br/>&gt; style of Edvard Munch&apos;s &quot;The Scream,&quot; and it summarizes<br/>&gt; the American attitude toward expressionism in a nutshell.</p><p>I think what it really summarizes in a nutshell is how some<br/>advertizing guy came up with what he thought was a great way<br/>to catch viewers&apos;s attention in hopes that it would help<br/>Buick sell more cars.</p><p>And in general in American advertizing there&apos;s a tendency<br/>to take unpalatable images and transform them into something<br/>easier to digest, pairing it with the implication that buying<br/>the product in question is the means toward effecting<br/>that transformation.  To me, that commercial doesn&apos;t say<br/>a hell of a lot about attitudes toward expressionist art.</p><p>Along with Van Gogh, Munch happens to be my favorite artist,<br/>and has been for a long, long time... way before &quot;The Scream&quot;<br/>became a late-20th-century icon with mass appeal.</p><p>&gt;     In the cinema, expressionism seems to fare much<br/>&gt; better</p><p>Here at last I agree with you.  Note that Schoenberg had<br/>a keen interest in film, and as early as 1914 was involved<br/>in plans to make his opera _Die Gl&iuml;&iquest;&half;ckliche Hand_ into a film<br/>with live orchestral and vocal accompaniment.  I&apos;m really<br/>disappointed that it never happened.</p><p>&gt; -- as in Robert Wien&apos;s &quot;The Cabinet of Dr.<br/>&gt; Caligari,&quot; Fritz Lang&apos;s &quot;Metropolis,&quot; Cocteau&apos;s<br/>&gt; &quot;Blood of the Poet&quot; and &quot;The Last Laugh.&quot; (I forget the<br/>&gt; director.)</p><p>F.
