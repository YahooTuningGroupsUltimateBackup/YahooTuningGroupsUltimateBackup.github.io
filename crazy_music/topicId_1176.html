In discussion with Jacky, I<br/>discovered he calls it the &quot;Interval of Completion&quot;,<br/>which in all honesty, I find to be a much superior term<br/>as &apos;comma&apos; is rather archaic and non-self-explanatory.</p><p>The process of tempering is then the process of<br/>reducing the size of the Interval of Completion.</p><p>Any other terms used out there for this idea?</p><p>I mysely find myself calling both the operation and the<br/>result the &apos;emainder&apos; (short obviously for exponential<br/>remainder) and favor the symbol %%, which I now<br/>consider to be the self-evident answer, though I<br/>allowed the keyword &apos;emod&apos; as an alias in the software.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
