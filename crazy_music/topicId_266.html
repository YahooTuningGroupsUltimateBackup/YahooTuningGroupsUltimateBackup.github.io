Either Joe Monzo<br/>&gt;was lying outright, or he is pervasively ignorant of Arnold<br/>&gt;Schoenberg&apos;s writings.</p><p>In my book the only people who make fools of themselves are the ones<br/>who launch off on gratuitous rants.  Monz is a scholar who knows a great<br/>deal about music history, more, I would guess, than some others who<br/>seem to believe that they, and they alone, have a lock on Truth.  Have<br/>you ever thought that a courteous response is more effective than<br/>hurling insults?  Or is the problem that being nasty is just more &quot;fun&quot;?</p><p>&gt;It&apos;s so simple and so easy to prove that Schoenberg&apos;s foolish<br/>&gt;claims are false that it&apos;s insulting to even to have descend to this<br/>&gt;kind of kindegarten level to prove these obvious facts.</p><p>Poor baby!  So sorry that you had to &quot;descend&quot; to the level of mere<br/>mortals!</p><p>&gt;apparently that&apos;s what people like Joe Monzo require -- the<br/>&gt;kindergarten level.</p><p>If Monzo is in kindergarten, some others have yet to be toilet trained,<br/>if their bathroom habits are as uncontrolled as their words.</p><p>&gt;So the larger point here is that Schoenberg was triply ignorant<br/>&gt;and triply arrogant and triply incompetent</p><p>There&apos;s a lot of that going around.</p><p>&gt;arrogant incompetent ignorami like Arnold Schoenberg would be left<br/>&gt;to sit by the freeway holding a big cardboard sign reading WILL<br/>&gt;SPOUT ARROGANT GIBBERISH FOR FOOD.</p><p>At last we seem to have arrived at a topic you know a great deal about!</p><p>&gt;Schoenberg made this foolishly false statement not just once, but<br/>&gt;several times</p><p>But not as many times as you&apos;ve repeated your insults in this single<br/>post, I would bet.</p><p>&gt;At this point it behooves everyone to notice that the attack dogs<br/>&gt;on this discussion group</p><p>Whom you identify as Graham Breed, Joe Monzo, and myself.  If we are<br/>&quot;attack dogs&quot;, what are you?</p><p>&gt;have produced no music recently, and they<br/>&gt;have not yet released even one (1) single CD of their music between<br/>&gt;them.<br/>&gt;Joe Monzo has produced no CDs of his music, and of course John<br/>&gt;deLaubenfels has produced no CDs of his music.</p><p>Wow, you must be psychic!  You must be God himself to know such a thing.<br/>It&apos;s wrong, as it happens.</p><p>&gt;Meanwhile, I continue to produce CDs of my music. My latest CD,<br/>&gt;now more than halfway finished, continues toward completion at a<br/>&gt;rapid pace.  By contrast, neither of three attack dogs on this<br/>&gt;discussion have produced any music lately as far as anyone can<br/>&gt;discern.</p><p>Perhaps if you asked rather than ranting, you would be better informed.<br/>BTW, I&apos;m glad (and I&apos;m sure Monz and Graham are too) that you&apos;re<br/>producing CD&apos;s, especially if the music is any good.</p><p>&gt;While I continue to upload works in progress, Joe Monzo has<br/>&gt;uploaded nothing lately. Graham Breed has uploaded nothing.  John<br/>&gt;deLaubenfels has uploaded nothing.  Instead of creating music, these<br/>&gt;three attack dogs spew gibberish supported by ignorant fallacies and<br/>&gt;outright lies.</p><p>I have uploaded many things.  Perhaps you&apos;ve been too busy to notice.<br/>My work is on my web page, which remains at the same address as it&apos;s<br/>been all the times I&apos;ve reported it to you.  But I don&apos;t believe you&apos;re<br/>interested, are you?  It&apos;s so much easier to say that something doesn&apos;t<br/>exist than to acknowledge it, and perhaps actually take the effort to<br/>make an intelligent critique of it.  Any such effort could cut seriously<br/>into the precious hours spent ranting.</p><p>&gt;Why have Joe Monzo and Graham Breed and John deLaubenfels<br/>&gt;produced no music during the last couple of weeks, in which I produced<br/>&gt;3 new musical compositions?</p><p>&gt;Simple -- because it takes an incredible amount of time and<br/>&gt;energy and effort to defend ignorant fools like Arnold Schoenberg<br/>&gt;from the consequences of their own folly.  It takes fantastic amounts<br/>&gt;of mental calisthenics and stupefying amounts of ingenuity to argue<br/>&gt;out of existence by mere words Hermann Helmholtz&apos;s pervasive errors<br/>&gt;-- especially when Helmholtz&apos;s false claims contradict so obviously<br/>&gt;and so audibly everyday musical experience, as in Helmholtz&apos;s<br/>&gt;laughable claim that &quot;the minor chord sound more dissonant than the<br/>&gt;major&quot; and &quot;the minor mode is musically inferior to the major.&quot;</p><p>This is funny - how much time does it take to write one of your multi-<br/>hundred line rants?  Some of us also have to work for a living, BTW.<br/>But we still manage to find time to make music, and the fact that you<br/>state over and over that we do not does not change this.</p><p>As for minor mode: I happen to like music in minor, but at the same time<br/>Helmholtz is right to say that a major triad is more consonant than a<br/>minor triad, IMHO.  That&apos;s my ears, not theory.  So Helmholtz was right,<br/>about this as about so much.</p><p>&gt;the latter-day musical prelates Joe Monzo and John DeLaubenfels waste<br/>&gt;their lives in a near-hysterical effort to conjure out of existence<br/>&gt;by elaborate and incoherent arguments the masssive errors and<br/>&gt;obviously audible fallacies of their respective cult leaders --<br/>&gt;Arnold Schoenberg and Hermann Helmholtz.</p><p>Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!  But perhaps your writing<br/>shouldn&apos;t be labeled &quot;near-hysterical&quot;; that wouldn&apos;t be giving it<br/>enough &quot;credit&quot;!</p><p>&gt;Standard stuff. It&apos;s an old story.  On every discussion group,<br/>&gt;there are always a bunch of do-nothing know-nothing people who never<br/>&gt;create -- they only destroy. They can&apos;t build up, they can only tear<br/>&gt;down.</p><p>Now this is getting downright weird.  Ever read your own stuff?  But of<br/>course you give yourself special permission to be a divine destroyer,<br/>don&apos;t you?</p><p>&gt;But music is not communication. Music has nothing to do with<br/>&gt;communication. Music involves emotions and wordless evocative<br/>&gt;impressions.  This is not communication, it&apos;s art.</p><p>Saying it&apos;s art doesn&apos;t mean it isn&apos;t communication.</p><p>&gt;Bottom line?</p><p>&gt;Schoenberg is a pimple on the ass of music. Schoenberg is a turd<br/>&gt;in a flaming paper bag on the doorstep of music history, and it is<br/>&gt;demeaning even to step on him in order to put the fire out.</p><p>Gee, then why do you &quot;demean&quot; yourself in this way?  It&apos;s a tough job,<br/>but somebody&apos;s got to do it, eh?</p><p>I&apos;m still hoping we might see mclaren the grown-up some day.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
