It certainly<br/>won&apos;t crash, as Brian suggested.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s better in more &quot;transparent&quot; tonal pieces, such as Mozart,<br/>&gt; Haydn, Schubert, etc...</p><p>Yes, clearly this is the kind of music the program (especially in 5-<br/>limit mode) was designed for. Music that isn&apos;t based on tertian<br/>harmony won&apos;t stand to benefit from retuning by a program that seeks<br/>to improve the tertian harmony!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But, perhaps that is the point in the selections.  With chromatic<br/>&gt; music as in these selections, the difference between just<br/>intonation<br/>&gt; and 12-equal is, I believe, somewhat a moot point...</p><p>Actually, John deLaubenfels appears to agree with me and W. A.<br/>Mathieu that 12-equal is the melodically &quot;smoothest&quot; way of tuning a<br/>chromatic scale . . . hence John deL&apos;s recent introduction of<br/>a &quot;melodic smoothness&quot; or &quot;step-equalization&quot; option into his program.</p></div>
