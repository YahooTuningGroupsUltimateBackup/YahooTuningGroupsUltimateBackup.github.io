(..)<br/>  &quot;My basic point being is that one cannot dissect even one aspect<br/>  &quot;of a work of art.&quot;</p><p>  But that&apos;s just what you&apos;re doing, Kraig, when you try to use<br/>Boosmliter &amp; Creel&apos;s results and the harmonic series and mythical<br/>&quot;integer ratio detectors&quot; inside people&apos;s heads to support JI.<br/>It&apos;s exactly what you&apos;re doing when you say that &quot;If you put<br/>different pitches in different ears the ear will hear difference<br/>tones. JI intervals will have these in tune and will beat<br/>less.&quot; -- Kraig Grady, Message 729, op cit.</p><p>  What you&apos;re doing here, Kraig, is dissecting art down to<br/>a particularly crude and blunt level -- the level of beats.<br/>Less beats = good, more beats = bad.  Therefore JI is<br/>good, according to your argument.</p><p>  First, it seems to me that your claim &quot;one cannot dissect<br/>even one aspect of a work of art&quot; by means of math or physics<br/>is far closer to the truth than crude caricatures like counting<br/>beats per second or mythical &quot;integer ratio detectors&quot; inside<br/>people&apos;s heads (which have been shown not to exist).<br/>  Efforts to use such startlingly crude caricatures to<br/>justify one particular tuning or class of musical composition<br/>are stupefyingly simplistic, Kraig, and for that reason they<br/>have never worked -- and never will work. Euler tried it with<br/>his Gradus Suavitatus, and he got laughed out of court. Helmholtz<br/>tried it with his Klangverwandschaft scheme, and in order to<br/>make his concoction work Helmholtz had to claim that the 7th<br/>overtone does not exist in the timbre of Western instruments.<br/>  These kinds of bizarre and foolish results come from overly<br/>simplistic schemes for classifying and categorizing music.<br/>  Incredibly cartoonish methods of dissecting musical artworks<br/>like &quot;count beats/sec&quot; or &quot;match-ups between harmonic overtones&quot;<br/>are so caricaturish that they seem to me about on the level<br/>of, say, deciding who is a good physicist by looking at the<br/>guy&apos;s haircut, or deciding whether you want to marry a girl<br/>by asking &quot;How white are her teeth?&quot;<br/>   These kinds of criteria are so crude and so simplistic<br/>that they don&apos;t even come close to telling us anything useful.<br/>   In music, such incredibly simplistic cartoonish criteria<br/>are things like difference tones, beats, &quot;the chord of nature,&quot;<br/>the harmonic series, and Boomsliter and Creel&apos;s claims about<br/>extended reference.<br/>   These ideas are incredibly simplistic because they all boil<br/>down to doing baby math. Are they integers, and if so, how<br/>small are the integers? Subtract the integers. Add the<br/>integers.<br/>    If music were really this simple, we would sit in gape-<br/>jawed adoration of the screech from a smoke detector, whose<br/>&quot;pure perfect natural&quot; overtones form a &quot;perfect chord of<br/>nature&quot; generated by the &quot;pure perfect natural chord of<br/>nature.&quot;<br/>    Ever HEAR the screech from a smoke detector?<br/>    Yeesh.<br/>    It&apos;s the most stultifyingly boring timbre known to man.<br/>    The human brain is complex, Kraig, and craves change<br/>and variation and variance and departures from regularity.<br/>This is as true of music and musical timbre as it is of<br/>art -- who wants to sit in a music looking at a big square<br/>or pure red or a big square of pure green on the wall? Can<br/>you imagine anything more boring?  More cartoonish? More<br/>simplistic?<br/>    But the rods and cones in our eyes are adapted to detect<br/>particular primary colors, Kraig, so according to your<br/>kind of argument the most perfect art should consist of<br/>big blocks of pure primay colors...just as the most perfect<br/>music should supposedly consist of the pure perfect natural<br/>overtones of the harmonic series moving in lockstep with one<br/>another in tunings made up of sections of the harmonic series.<br/>    That&apos;s far too crude and too simplistic, Kraig, because<br/>in between the ear and the mind lies the brain.  Just as<br/>in between the retina and the mind lies the brain.<br/>    Our brain is complicated and designed to detect mainly<br/>change, not things which are stationary and trivial and<br/>simple. As a result, our brains crave irregularity and asymmetry<br/>and complexity and subtlety, and we get bored without it.<br/>    This is why cartoonish ideas like &quot;small integers&quot;<br/>results in what one member of this discussion group (whom I<br/>shall not name) called &quot;music so bland I can&apos;t stand it.&quot;<br/>    Boomsliter and Creel merely change this question (Are the<br/>integers small) very slightly by asking: Are the musical<br/>DISTANCES from one melodic key center to another very small<br/>integers? rather than the traditional crude question: Are<br/>the pitches of the melodic notes themselves very small integers?<br/>   The idea that this is all there is to the human ear/brain<br/>system seems insulting not only to humans, but to biology<br/>itself.<br/>   Kraig, we&apos;ve got upwards of 100 billion (with a B) brain<br/>cells in our heads. Each brain cell is connected to about<br/>10,000 others. Each brain cell is more complex than the<br/>computer on your desktop.<br/>   And after feeding all that complexity with 30 or 40 or<br/>50 years of hands-on context-dependent relational knowledge<br/>and experience...<br/>   ...Human hearing boils down to small integers?<br/>   Please.<br/>   IT doesn&apos;t even pass the straight-face test. It&apos;s like<br/>claiming that the purpose of the proton-antiproton collider<br/>at CERN must be...to boil water.</p><p>    However, the second issue (aside from the sheer crudity<br/>and cartoonish triviality of simplistic numerical schemes<br/>like Boomsliter and Creel&apos;s, or Euler&apos;s, or Pythagoras&apos;) is<br/>that Boomsliter and Creel&apos;s results came from badly flawed<br/>procedures and had a lot of problems.</p><p>     Let&apos;s talk about those problems.</p><p>     Since you haven&apos;t yet quoted a single line from<br/>Boomsliter and Creel&apos;s 1963 paper in the Journal of Music<br/>Theory, it&apos;s not clear whether you&apos;ve actually read the<br/>paper. Probably you have. For those of you who haven&apos;t,<br/>B&amp;C&apos;s 1963 paper is called &quot;Extended Reference: An<br/>Unrecognized Dynamic In Melody,&quot; Journal of Music Theory,<br/>1963, and in it Paul Boomsliter and Warren Creel claimed<br/>that the human ear operates by difference tones, and<br/>that in effect the real pitches played by real musicians<br/>in the real world were created by using intervals<br/>relative to temporary melodic JI pitch centers.  This<br/>made the pitches numerically complex, but audibly simple,<br/>according to Boomsliter and Creel.<br/>   The term &quot;extended reference&quot; comes from B&amp;C&apos;s description<br/>of how we supposedly hear melodies. At first we reference<br/>the melodic pitches to the 1/1, but as the melody moves away<br/>from the 1/1, B&amp;C claim we reference new melodic pitches<br/>to pitches different from the 1/1 -- perhaps the 3/2, or<br/>the 6/5, etc.<br/>   This results in complicated ratios, but the pitch differences<br/>(which is what we really hear) between local melodic notes<br/>and the local extended reference pitch remain simple.</p><p>  Here is what B&amp;C themselves wrote about extended reference:</p><p>    &quot;To this we can add that the audience would have<br/>noticed, and -- improbable as it may at first seem --<br/>would have been disturbed, if the singers had sung<br/>the notes &grave;on pitch,&apos; in the theoretically correct<br/>tunings prescribed by the just scale or equal<br/>temperament. (..)<br/>  &quot;Music theorists have customarily taken harmony as<br/>the source of melody, treating a melodic sequence<br/>as the surface of a harmony or of a chord progression,<br/>again a form of direct reference.  Yet difficulties<br/>arise when this is applied to a specific melodic<br/>sequence. Let us take as example the opening strain of<br/>The Marseillaise, Figure 3. The tuning, selected on<br/>the Search Organ by Robert Enman, music teacher at the<br/>Emma Willard school in Troy, New York, begins: Sol<br/>Sol Sol Day Day Re Re Say May Day. Of course classical<br/>just intonation would be Do instead of Day, Sol instead<br/>of Say, and Mi instead of May. Mr. Enman starts with Sol,<br/>a direct reference, 3/2 to Do, it has multiple references,<br/>being 1/1 on the second level, and 4/3 on the third. The<br/>melody goes promptly into extended reference, to Day, 9/5<br/>to the third reference. (The cent values and ratios of<br/>all notes are shown on Figure 2). Played in just tuning<br/>the melody does not have the quality of a good Marseillaise;<br/>it sounds dull. The just notes Sol Do Re Mi and Sol, sounded<br/>as a chord or combination of chords, do not have the quality<br/>of the Marseillaise. This opening phrase is notably<br/>electrifying melody, and it has the Marseillalse quality in<br/>Mr. Enman&apos;s tuning.  The effect cannot plausibly be described<br/>as that of any chord. Sol and Day sounded together do not<br/>harmonize, yet the tuning the ear wants in this melodic<br/>sequence is Day, while the sound of Do is rejected as<br/>wrong and dull.<br/>    &quot;Conventional theory explains melodic vitality, or<br/>melodic tension, by a principle of consonance and<br/>dissonance which cannot be narrowly applied, and by<br/>the tendency of certain notes to serve as points of<br/>rest, and the tendency of other notes to pull toward<br/>these, which can indeed be observed if one plays up<br/>the scale, treating the scale as a melody. However, we<br/>submit that in this phrase of The Marseillaise the<br/>tension is not heard simply as a pull of some notes<br/>toward other notes which sound restful. In addition to<br/>any tensions between note and note, the whole phrase<br/>has tension, which may well be caused by the tense<br/>relationship, the extended reference, to the tonic.<br/>    &quot;It is observable that all melodies have, throughout<br/>their course, an effect of something started but not<br/>yet finished, of motion toward a destination that<br/>is known, but not yet reached. It is also true that<br/>all melodies begin by establishing a tonic and going<br/>into extended reference to it, and they stay in<br/>extended reference until the end, which is accomplished<br/>by a return to direct reference and, normally, to the<br/>tonic. We submit then, that extended reference is<br/>the characteristic organization of melody; it is<br/>possibly the chief source (although certainly not<br/>the only source) of the tension and relaxation that<br/>go on in melody.<br/>    &quot;To illustrate in detail: The note Day has the<br/>ratio 81/80 to the tonic. This is impossibly complex<br/>as a direct ratio. In terms of the partial series it<br/>is the relationship between the 81st partial and<br/>the 80th - impracticably high. With a maximum of<br/>transposing down it is the relation between the 81st<br/>partial and the 5th - still impracticable, it cannot<br/>be explained by cultural conditioning to the tempered<br/>scale, since the tempered first is Do, zero cents,<br/>exactly like just Do. This note, and others in its<br/>sequence, can be explained as an auditory result of<br/>organization in simple ratios, if we assume that the<br/>auditory system can handle simple ratios in linkages,<br/>or chains.<br/>    &quot;The implications of this hypothesis for auditory<br/>theory are discussed at some length in the Second<br/>interim Report.  In brief, we hold that...we select and<br/>organize the various partials of a normal complex<br/>tone by the fact that the partials synchronize;<br/>they are in step with each other. We exclude<br/>interfering vibratlons from the sensation because<br/>they do not keep step; thus we perform the essential<br/>operation of hearing through interference. This<br/>normal organization by direct synchronization is the<br/>constant function of our hearing in all tones, and<br/>it is altogether too ordinary to be musically<br/>interesting.  It is child&apos;s play. The auditory nerve<br/>network, equipped for synchronization by the necessities<br/>of normal hearing, is also able to project a matrix<br/>that organizes synchronizations linked together one<br/>after another, in a pattern different from the<br/>partial series. Now this is interesting. It stimulates<br/>and rivets the attention because it is not the same<br/>easy partial series pattern. it requires effort to<br/>maintain the linked matrix (keep the key). Such a<br/>linked matrix of simple ratios, although manageable,<br/>is unusual, therefore tense, and requires resolution<br/>by return to direct reference to end the pattern. Thus<br/>melodic tunings, except at the start and end of a<br/>melody, are organized to depart from the partial<br/>series. At the same time these tunings are organized<br/>by extended applications of synchronization -- the<br/>process that organizes the partial series.&quot; [Boosmliter,<br/>Paul and Warren Creel, &quot;Extended Reference: An Unrecognized<br/>Dynamic In Melody,&quot; Journal of Music Theory, 1963, op cit.]</p><p>   You can see some of the problems with Boomsliter &amp;<br/>Creel&apos;s procedure right off.<br/>   For one thing, they are essentially talking about<br/>modeling human hearing as difference tones.  But that<br/>scheme was tried by Felix Krueger in 1906 and was<br/>conclusively debunked by Carl Stumpf in 1908.</p><p>    &quot;Krueger regarded consonance and dissonance as<br/>determined by another factor extrinsic to the interval<br/>itself, namely the difference tones generated by it.<br/>(..) ...According to Krueger, the consonance or dissonance<br/>of any interval depends on the simplicity or complexity<br/>of its structure of difference tones. Much criticism has<br/>been leveled at...these theories, and it may safely be<br/>said that they have been proved entirely untenable.&quot; [Mursell,<br/>James L. &quot;The Psychology of Music,&quot; W. W. Norton &amp; Company<br/>Inc.: New York, 1937, pg. 93]</p><p>    I have written about the difference tone myth elsewhere<br/>in &quot;Myths and Misconceptions about Just Intonation.&quot;<br/>The myth that difference tones &quot;explain&quot; music or &quot;explain&quot;<br/>human hearing or &quot;explain&quot; harmony or &quot;explain&quot; melody is<br/>yet another dead debunked superstition, like the myth<br/>that small integers = musical consonance, the myth that<br/>the human ear/brain system has integer ratios inside it,<br/>the myth that music evolves from simpler to more complex<br/>forms, the myth that harmony evolved historically through<br/>the overtone series, the myth that history is on a constant<br/>progression toward more and more musical chromaticism so<br/>that atonality represents the irresistable endpoint of<br/>an inevitable historical process, and countless other<br/>musical myths and old wive&apos;s tales.</p><p>    To summarize my discussion which elsewhere discusses<br/>the vast amounts of evidence that disprove the old wive&apos;s<br/>tale that human hearing dependson differenc tones:</p><p>    SUMMARY OF THE FAILURES OF DIFFERENCE TONE THEORIES</p><p>Difference tones fail to explain human hearing because:</p><p>[1] If human hearing depended solely or even mainly on<br/>   difference tones, then all musical cultures throughout<br/>   the world would hear the same musical intervals as<br/>   sounding musically consonant. Ethnomusiclogy tells us<br/>   that they don&apos;t.</p><p>[2] If human hearing depended on difference tones, Western<br/>   European music history would show a consistent judgment<br/>   of certain musical intervals as always consonant, and<br/>   other musical intervals as always dissonant. Music<br/>   history tells us the opposite. Throughout Western European<br/>   musical history, some intervals have been considered<br/>   dissonant which were previously heard as consonant and<br/>   vice versa. Intervals constantly change their perceptual<br/>   status according to the style of musical composition<br/>   popular in a given historical period, not according to<br/>   mythical difference tone detectors engraved inside our ears.</p><p>[3] If human hearing depended on difference tones, then because<br/>    the loudness of difference tones depends disproprtionately<br/>    on the loudness of the component tones,  ppp minor seconds<br/>    and major sevenths would sound more consonant than ffff octaves.<br/>    No observer ever reports such a musical perception. No Western<br/>    music textbook has ever made this claim. Western music utterly<br/>    discounts the loudness of tones in a musical interval when<br/>    classifying the interval as consonant or dissonant, yet this<br/>    is crucial for creating various levels of difference tones,<br/>    for the louder the 2 tones the more audible difference tones<br/>    occur and therefore the greater the interference twixt all<br/>    newly-audible difference tones.</p><p>[4] If human hearing depended on difference tones, then the frequency<br/>    spectrum of tones in an interval would exert an overwhelming<br/>    influence on its audible consonance. For example, a perfect<br/>    fifth sounded between two clarinets would theoretically produce<br/>    a very different musical effect than a perfect fifth sounded<br/>    between two flutes (since clarinets produce mainly odd numbered<br/>    overtones, while flutes tend to produce even numbered overtones).<br/>    But listeners do not report this. Instead, listeners prove able<br/>    to reliably identify musical intervals regardless of the overtone<br/>    structure of the instruments on which they are sounded, and<br/>    listeners and composers hear and use musical intervals uniformly<br/>    within the constraints of a musical style regardless of the<br/>    instruments which produce them. Thus, for example, Bach never<br/>    composes flute duets in which the harmony consists entirely of<br/>    minor seconds. Likewise, Bartok almost never composes pieces<br/>which<br/>    consist entirely of Palestrina-like major and minor triads,<br/>    regardless of the timbres Bartok calls for in the composition.</p><p>[5] The phenomenon of categorical perception systematically<br/>contradicts<br/>    claims for human hearing based on on difference tones. Listeners<br/>    universally report pitches and intervals far away from their<br/>    nominal frequencies as sounding nonetheless &quot;in tune,&quot; and this<br/>    effect has been so comprehensively documented that it cannot be<br/>denied.</p><p>[6] Listeners outside a given culture also often prove unable to hear<br/>   musical effects reported by listeners familiar with the musical<br/>   culture. This again argues against the purported musical<br/>importance<br/>   of sensory percepts like difference tones.</p><p>[7] Listeners who are not musically educated report an entirely<br/>   different ranking for dyadic musical intervals than listeners<br/>   who are musically educated. This indicates that the main component<br/>   of musical listening is acculturation--NOT the physical acoustics<br/>   of difference tones.</p><p>[8] Within a single composition, the same musical interval can sound<br/>    both musically consonant at one point, and musically dissonant at<br/>    another point--depending on context. This again tends to disprove<br/>    claims of human hearing according to numerical physical<br/>interactions<br/>    like difference tones, since the same identical interval, with<br/>    identical difference tones, should produce identical numerical<br/>    physical interactions due to difference tones.</p><p>[9] The pervasive practice of tempering musical intervals should<br/>   produce horrible effects, according to the theory of difference<br/>   tone hearing, since detuning an interval slightly produces a<br/>   much greater detuning in the difference tones. (You can see this<br/>   mathematically by noticing that every slight detunings like<br/>20,001/10,000<br/>   produce an enormously large difference tone.) Listeners do not<br/>   report that tempering or detuning intervals produces<br/>disproportionate<br/>   musical dissonance, and this in turn indicates that difference<br/>   tones are not significant in our musical perception of intervals.</p><p>[10] If the theory that our ears hear by detecting difference tones<br/>is<br/>    correct, then intervals played on inharmonic instruments like<br/>    carillons or chimes or tubulongs should sound unbearably<br/>dissonant.<br/>    Once again, this doesn&apos;t happen.</p><p>[11] Among all the world&apos;s musical cultures, ONLY India and Western<br/>    Europe have developed theories of music which place importance on<br/>    mathematics and  acoustics and abstract computations like<br/>difference<br/>    tones. The other 85% of the world&apos;s population does not think of<br/>    music in terms of mathematics and has no interest in trying to<br/>    mathematically derive or explain the effects of its music. This<br/>    indicates that the Western European attempt to derive and explain<br/>    its music by means of mathematics is as much a superstition as<br/>the<br/>    attempt of certain Amazon indian tribes to explain their music by<br/>    reference to &quot;gods of the river&quot; and &quot;gods of the air.&quot;</p><p>[12] Theories of difference tones fail when consonant intervals are<br/>    octave-inverted. For example, the perfect fourth is sometimes<br/>    classed as a dissonance because its difference tones clash with<br/>    the notes of the perfect fourth interval. But if this is correct,<br/>    then the just minor sixth should also be classed as a dissonance<br/>    because its difference tones also clash with the notes of the<br/>    interval. In fact, ALL octave-inverted JI consonances (major<br/>    third, minor third, perfect fifth) theoretically produce<br/>    difference tones which clash with the fundamental and therefore<br/>ALL<br/>    octave-inverted consonant JI intervals should sound dissonant.<br/>    Listeners do not report this.</p><p>[13] Psychoacoustic experiments show that difference tones prove<br/>    far too faint to be audible under most musical circumstances.<br/>    Theorists try to argue this laboratory data out of existence<br/>    by claiming that &quot;the ear unconsciously processes the very<br/>    faint difference tones, even though they sound inaudible under<br/>    ordinary musical conditions.&quot; But this sophistry creates even<br/>    larger problems for the music theorist, for having allowed<br/>    inaudible difference tones into hi/r theory, the theorist can<br/>    no longer justify ignoring the vast number of very faint<br/>    combination tones which occur between the 2nd overtone of one<br/>    note in a dyad and the 2nd overtone of the other note, the<br/>    3rd overtone of one note in a dyad and the 3rd overtone of the<br/>    other note, the 4th overtone of one note in a dyad and the<br/>    4th overtone of the other note, and so on, tens of difference<br/>    tones and scores of difference tones and hundreds of difference<br/>    tones.  All of which must now be taken into consideration in<br/>    theoretical determinations of musical consonance--since the<br/>    theorist has prestigitated out of existence the overwhelming<br/>    laboratory evidence that actual difference tones between real<br/>    musical notes in the real world prove inaudible, thus opening<br/>    the door to a flood of inaudible and hitherto ignored difference<br/>    tones of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th,<br/>    12th, 13th, 14th and higher order.</p><p>[14] Calculations involving difference tones lead to mathematically<br/>    invariant conclusions which ought to dictate a uniform response<br/>    by all members of a given culture in a given context to a given<br/>    musical interval. But psychoacoustic experiments show that<br/>different<br/>    listeners respond differently to the same musical interval even<br/>if<br/>    that interval be presented to members of the same musical culture<br/>    with the same musical training within the same musical context:</p><p>    &quot;We were very surprised to observe that subjects showed two<br/>distinct<br/>patterns. Nine subjects (top three rows of Fig 1) had &grave;M&apos; patterns,<br/>in<br/>which chords deviating from just intonation by +15 and -15 cents were<br/>judged to be most in tune and chords with just intonation or<br/>deviating<br/>from just intonation by +30 and -30 cents are judged to be less in<br/>tune.<br/>For reasons to be discussed later, we describe these subjects as<br/>&grave;rich&apos;<br/>listeners. A second distinct pattern is apparent for the four<br/>subjects<br/>shown on the bottom of Fig. 1. It shows inverted &grave;V&apos; patterns, in<br/>which<br/>just chords were preferred to all others. We refer to this group as<br/>&grave;pure&apos; listeners. The grouping of the listeners does not correspond<br/>to<br/>any classification according to training that we have been able to<br/>discover. (..) &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;<br/>    &quot;From this experiment we conclude that...listeners fall into two<br/>groups: one of which, the &grave;pure&apos; group, prefers chords with just<br/>intonation and the other of which, the &grave;rich&apos; group, prefers chords<br/>which deviate enough from just intonation so a pleasant beating can<br/>be heard.&quot; [Mathews, M. V., J. R. Pierce, and L. A. Roberts, &quot;Harmony<br/>and New Scales,&quot; in J. Sundberg (ed.), &quot;Harmony and Tonality,&quot;<br/>Stockholm:<br/>Royal Swedish Academy of Music, 1986]</p><p>[15] Physiological experiments have proven conclusively that the<br/>   nonlinear distortion in the inner ear does not conform to<br/>Helmholtz&apos;s<br/>   hypothesized frequency-independent power law. Rather, the amplitude<br/>   of nonlinear distortion depends crucially on the frequency of the<br/>   tones -- which plays havoc with theories like Boomsliter &amp; Creel&apos;s.</p><p>-------</p><p>   Given the overwhelming eveidence against any musical important of<br/>difference tones for human hearing, it&apos;s clear that Boomsliter &amp;<br/>Creel&apos;s theory rests on a foundation which has already been<br/>demmolished.  In fact, no serious psychoacoustician or audiologist<br/>or music researcher today believes that difference tones provide<br/>an adequate explanation of musical structures or a credible<br/>model for human hearing, since so much evidence against the<br/>alleged musical importance of difference tones has been amassed<br/>over the last 90 years.</p><p>    So the first big problem with Boomsliter &amp; Creel&apos;s theory of<br/>extended reference is that it starts with assumptions about<br/>human hearing which have been proven incorrect.</p><p>    &quot;Difference tones were observed by Tartini as early as 1714,<br/>[29] and were applied by him as an aid to judgments of intonation<br/>for double-stops on the violin. Only the first order difference<br/>tone was known to Tartini, and even this estimated incorrectly.<br/>Nevertheless he demonstrates practically that any two tones<br/>forming an interval give rise automatically to a &grave;terza suono,&apos;<br/>and that this &grave;third sound&apos; does not result merely from suggestion<br/>but is present to the ear. Tartini regards this resultant tone<br/>as the natural bass of the whole, and on this principle he constructs<br/>a valuable theory of harmonic practice. Hindemith [30] follows the<br/>same principle, though describing it as an original discovery.<br/>     &quot;Krueger attributes consonance to the absence of disturbance<br/>caused by difference tones of the several orders; or, alternatively,<br/>to their reinforcement of the lower tone of an interval, or of its<br/>lower octave. &grave;This relative intensification of the lowest difference<br/>tone is the greater, the more consonant the primary interval, the<br/>simpler its vibration ratio, the fewer difference tones other than<br/>the characteristic one are still possible; stated otherwise: the<br/>more tones coincide in it.&apos; [31] It follows from his calculations<br/>that &grave;the phenomena, due to differene tones, are in exact<br/>correspondence<br/>to the degrees of consonance and dissonance. The most perfect<br/>consonances (unisone and octave) have no distinct difference<br/>consonance, the larger the number of difference-tones  and the<br/>greater the consequent danger of mutual disturbance.&apos; [32]<br/>    &quot;We need not follow here the intricate mathematical<br/>constructions by which Krueger carries out difference tones<br/>up to five orders to make explicit how they determine consonance<br/>response. Stumpf criticizes both the results and the assumptions<br/>involved. He shows that by Krueger&apos;s formula, such frequency<br/>combinations as 800 and 1100 cycles, in ratio 8:11, would not<br/>show disturbances of the type Krueger identifies as the source<br/>of dissonance. &grave;Even triads can be constituted in which all three<br/>tones indubitably are mutually dissonant, without the difference<br/>tones arising according to Krueger&apos;s rules producing more than<br/>the mildest beats or disturbances.&apos; [33] Thus a combination of<br/>tones in the ratios 3:7:10:17:27 would turn out not to be<br/>dissonant by Krueger&apos;s definition. Finally, Stumpf argues that<br/>to attribute consonance to an agreement among difference tones and<br/>their progenitors requires a prior assumption of just what<br/>constitutes consonant agreement, and that is the very issue<br/>involved. &grave;Always, therefore, the existence and operation of<br/>consonance must already be grounded somehow upon other<br/>characteristics.&apos; [34] The awkwardness of Hindemith&apos;s manipulation<br/>of &grave;natural&apos; difference tone roots [35] is due in some measure to<br/>a similar rationalizing assumption of what was to be demonstrated.<br/>Experimental evidence shows further that  the sensing of combination<br/>tones is very much dependent upon the loudness of the primary tones,<br/>[36] so that the theory would necessarily have to posit a variation<br/>of consonance and dissonance response as a function of loudness,<br/>which is hardly tenable, and on the other hand would be unable<br/>to account for any such response below a loudness level of about<br/>42 db above threshold, at which combination tones become barely<br/>distinguishable.<br/>    &quot;While the sensory phenomena of combination tones do not<br/>appear to explain the perception of consonance, they may well<br/>affect the euphonious properties of isolated sonorities. [37]<br/>&grave;Now in the defective intonation of the perfect consonances, at<br/>least the octave and the fifth, difference tones actually play<br/>a role.&apos; [38] Thus from the known characteristics, difference<br/>tones are useful to practical judgments of precision in the<br/>intonation of double stops, just as Tartini found initially.<br/>    &quot;They do not count for the perception of consonance.&quot; [Cazden,<br/>Norman. &quot;Sensory Theories of Musical Consonance,&quot; Journal of<br/>Aesthetics and Art Criticism, Vol. 20, pp. 301-319, 1962]</p><p>    &quot;The influence of difference tones on consonance perception<br/>also is not very probable in view of the data reproduced in<br/>Figs. 1 and 2. Moreover, experiments of one of the authors on<br/>the audibility of combination tones [21] showed that the nonlinear<br/>distortion of the hearing organ is so small that it cannot be<br/>regarded as a constitutive base for consonance.&quot; [Plomp, R.<br/>and W.J.M. Levelt, &quot;Tonal consonance and critical bandwidth,&quot; Journal<br/>of the Acoustical Society of America, Vol. 38, 1965, pp. 548-568.]</p><p>    The second big problem with Boomsliter &amp; Creel&apos;s theory<br/>of extended reference is that it boils down to unsupported personal<br/>preference.<br/>    In the quote from B&amp;C above, you can hear that B&amp;C merely<br/>claim that the extended reference version of The Marselleise<br/>&quot;sounds more electrifying,&quot; but they provide no proof of it.<br/>    This is important, because when we examine the procedure<br/>B&amp;C used to produce their listening tests, we find it&apos;s<br/>critically flawed.<br/>    Boomsliter and Creel did not use a double-blind experimental<br/>procedure.<br/>    What I am saying here is that Boomsliter &amp; Creel did not<br/>provide listeners with samples of melodies which neither the<br/>listener nor the experimenters to be extended reference or<br/>12-equal.<br/>    Instead, the &quot;experimental procedure&quot; consisted of B&amp;C<br/>FIRST getting a small group of musicians to produce melodies<br/>on a monochord, then using a &quot;by guess and by God&quot; method<br/>which can only be termed &quot;perceptions verging on the extrasensory&quot;<br/>to somehow guess the alleged &quot;extended reference&quot; pitches<br/>produced by that group of musicians on the monochord...<br/>     And finally B&amp;C built a &quot;search organ&quot; with a bunch<br/>of different JI pitches for each note.<br/>     A variety of listeners were then asked to use the search<br/>organ to produce what sounded to them like the &quot;best&quot; or<br/>&quot;most effective&quot; or &quot;most musical&quot; version of the melody.</p><p>     Well, you can see the whole plaethora of problems with<br/>Boomsliter &amp; Creel&apos;s test procedure.<br/>     First, since B&amp;C present while the listener used the<br/>search organ, they could have influenced hi/r without<br/>meaning to.<br/>      Second, the listener being tested always knew which<br/>pitches on the search organ he was playing, so there was<br/>a vast opportunity for bias, depending on the test subject&apos;s<br/>innate theoretical bias. I.e., if s/he believed in JI<br/>as the basis of music you&apos;d naturally expect the test<br/>subject to search for various JI pitches on the search<br/>organ and use &apos;em.<br/>       Third, the test subjects were ONLY given a choice<br/>of pitches already chosen on the search organ by Boomsliter<br/>&amp; Creel, which intolerably and unacceptably biases the<br/>entire experiment. Shoot, I can &quot;prove&quot; that all listeners<br/>prefer 12 equal for melodies if you allow me to select<br/>the pitches used on a search organ.  For that matter, by<br/>appropriate fiddling and twiddling with the source set<br/>of pitches, I can probably bias the experiment in such<br/>a way that listeners prefer any ET or JI system, merely<br/>by tainting the search organ by deliberately excluding<br/>some pitches and deliberately including others for each<br/>musical note. This is the classic error of observational<br/>selection.<br/>       Fourth, the procedure by which B&amp;C boiled down<br/>the conflicting and imprecise pitches sounded on the<br/>monochord to a limited set of &quot;extended reference&quot; pitches<br/>can only be described as witchcraft. There is no empirical<br/>basis for it, no proof that B&amp;C &quot;extended reference&quot; pitches<br/>are actually related to the pitches the test subjects played<br/>on the monochord, and worst of all -- monochords built<br/>without a very tough steel or aluminum pipe running down<br/>under the box are notoriously imprecise, because the high<br/>string tension will cause the box of the monochord to<br/>flex slightly and change the string&apos;s pitch when a<br/>listener stops off the pitch.  We don&apos;t know how well<br/>B&amp;C monochord was built, but it&apos;s safe to say it wasn&apos;t<br/>as precise as the world-class monochord&apos;s Bill Colvig<br/>builds.  Thus all of B&amp;C monochord measurements are<br/>strongly suspect to start with, and since these data<br/>points provide the starting pitches for the search organ,<br/>the whole procedure is hopelessly tainted from the outset.<br/>       Fifth, lots of experiments show that performers<br/>tend to compress musical intervals smaller than a<br/>minor third and expand musical intervals larger than a<br/>minor third. This is probably what the test subjects were<br/>doing, and they merely chose the nearest available JI<br/>pitches even though JI has nothing to do with what was<br/>going on.<br/>       Sixth, B&amp;C did not provide an adequate set of<br/>alternatives for listeners. They should have provided<br/>12 equal AND extended reference pitches AND a whole<br/>set of non-just non-equal-tempered pitches. But B&amp;C<br/>couldn&apos;t do that because their search organ was<br/>very limited in the total number of alternate pitches<br/>it could allow for each musical notes. To put it bluntly,<br/>the search organ was a piss poor idea from the outset<br/>because you can only have so many keys on any keyboard-<br/>based musical instrument.</p><p>    This is why I stated that</p><p>&gt;    There is not one shred of evidence for the false claim that<br/>&gt; singers or string players &quot;naturally play in just intonation,&quot;<br/>&gt; and there much evidence against the musical old wive&apos;s tale that<br/>&gt; solo performers &quot;naturally play in JI.&quot; -- mclaren</p><p>    As we can now discern quite clearly, Boomsliter and Creel<br/>never tested what performers &quot;naturally&quot; do -- instead, B&amp;C<br/>forced performers to choose from a limited set of pitches<br/>available on their search organ, and these pitches came<br/>out of the brains of Boomsliter &amp; Creel with no hard<br/>evidence to back &apos;em up.<br/>    Thus, we have no idea what B&amp;C&apos;s test subjects would<br/>do under &quot;natural&quot; conditions, since the search organ was<br/>forced upon them like a Procrustean bed.</p><p>    Much more reliable tests of what performers do &quot;naturally,&quot;<br/>that is, in actual performance are (logically enough)<br/>obtained from measurements of the actual pitches played<br/>by actual performers during actual musical performers.<br/>    Such measurements systematically disprove B&amp;C&apos;s claims.</p><p>    Lastly, we may note that Boomsliter &amp; Creel&apos;s approach<br/>is a typical Western mathematical reductionist approach<br/>to music. First, the issue to be studied is stripped of<br/>its complexity by removing it from the real world (instead<br/>of playing free pitches, the performer is forced to choose<br/>from among the predigested pitches available on the search<br/>organ).  Then the issue to be studied is boiled down<br/>further to a mathematical skeleton (i.e., B&amp;C&apos;s extended<br/>reference scheme).  The final stage occurs when the<br/>researcher declares the original rich complexity of<br/>the real intonation in real music in the real world<br/>irrelevant, and substitutes the dessicated mathematical<br/>skeleton for the rich living original as the &quot;real&quot;<br/>version.<br/>    This typical Western reductionist approach to music<br/>fails and fails badly because it wholly ignores the<br/>overwhelming importance of culture and emotion to<br/>music, as opposed to math and physics (viz., extended<br/>reference difference tones as dreamed up by B&amp;C):</p><p>    &quot;[Much Western music theory] seems to suggest that it<br/>ought to be possible to create a way of measuring or assessing<br/>musical compositions...related, in some way or another, to<br/>the compositions&apos; &grave;musicalness&apos;--the degree to which we think<br/>it&apos;s good or interesting music.<br/>    &quot;This seems like a project that might not succeed...because...<br/>music is actually a contingent combination of sounds whose<br/>emotional resonances are entirely dependent on the audience&apos;s<br/>personal and shared histories as listeners. By &grave;contingent&apos; I<br/>mean that it could have been otherwise. Music didn&apos;t have to<br/>consist of the elements and structures that it happens to<br/>consist of -- and indeed it consists of quite other ones in<br/>other cultures, as anyone attending a concert of classical<br/>Thai music will soon realize. (I once attended such a concert<br/>in Bangkok that was totally mystifying. I could see that<br/>the audience was utterly enraptured, swooning at moments of<br/>apparently overwhelming emotional beauty that made no impression<br/>on me whatsoever; not only that, I couldn&apos;t distinguish them<br/>from any other moments in the piece. (..) I had no cultural<br/>background against which to set this particular adventure.)<br/>    &quot;(..) The reason we can be moved by a single voice singing<br/>a simple song is clearly not because it has internal complexity,<br/>but because we do: we don&apos;t just hear sounds, but hosts of<br/>associations and historical, social and cultural undertones.<br/>A single voice is powerful to us because it is different in<br/>particular ways from most of our other musical experiences,<br/>and because this particular voice is different in particular<br/>ways from other voices we&apos;ve heard. Aesthetically, what we<br/>respond to are differences, not &grave;absolutes.&apos; That is why<br/>it is possible for a group of Lebanese to become ecstatic<br/>about the way Fairuz turns a phrase, while a non-aficionado<br/>of Arabic music will fail to get the point at all. What<br/>those Arab listeners are responding to is how she does<br/>it differently. So when they hear it, they hear it against<br/>an enormous repertoire of other possible ways of doing<br/>it, of other possible emotional resonances and associations.<br/>    &quot;This is a very important cultural issue, since it sets<br/>up a major division between two different ways of looking<br/>at cultural objects. In the traditional classical view,<br/>art-objects are containers of some kind of aesthetic value.<br/>In this view, the value was put into them by the artist<br/>(who got it from God) and it now radiates back out to<br/>those who behold it. It was thus that missionaries played<br/>gramophone records of Bach to Africans with the expectation<br/>that it would civilize them; they would somehow be enriched<br/>by the flood of goodness washing over them. We now see the<br/>arrogance of this assumption, but  I think few people<br/>understand what is really wrong-headed about it...culture<br/>objects have no notable identity outside of that that which<br/>we confer on them. Their &grave;value&apos; is entirely a product of<br/>the interaction that we have with them.&quot; [Eno, Brian, &quot;Resonant<br/>Complexity,&quot; The Whole Earth Review, 1995, pg. 42]</p><p>   So given the huge number of serious problems with<br/>B&amp;C&apos;s whole system of testing listeners, and given the<br/>large number of multiple independent experiments I<br/>have cited which contadict B&amp;C&apos;s results, it&apos;s safe<br/>to say that we can go with the experimental results which<br/>are most repeated and also have the fewest methodological<br/>problems.  That means the 5 experiments I cited win out.<br/>   No one has ever repeated Boomsliter &amp; Creel&apos;s experiment<br/>using modern equipment.<br/>   So that one experiment conducted by Boomsliter &amp; Creels<br/>seems like a very slender reed to hang your entire<br/>set of ideas about music from...particularly when there<br/>are so many other more solid experiments I have cited,<br/>which have been independently confirmed, and which all<br/>agree in contradicting Boomsliter &amp; Creel.</p><p>    When I wrote</p><p>&gt;    However, if Kraig means to point out that string<br/>&gt; players and singers adjust their pitch in complicated ways (not<br/>&gt; according to JI, or any known ET, however) while playing, there&apos;s<br/>&gt; plenty of evidence for that.</p><p>    Kaig replied</p><p>    &quot;As  I stated before the question far exceeds what can be<br/>tested in a laboratory.&quot;</p><p>     But Kraig, the problem with that claim is that you are<br/>essentially saying &quot;my hypothesis is untestable.&quot;<br/>     An untestable hypothesis is meaningless.<br/>     You can&apos;t have it both ways.  Either the hypothesis posits<br/>real effects in the real world...in which case it can be<br/>tested.  Or, you may claim things that have no actual effects<br/>in the real world -- for instance, the so-called &quot;psychic healer&quot;<br/>who claimed he could make &quot;healing energy&quot; flow through the internet.<br/>But could anyone measure the so-called &quot;healing energy&quot;?<br/>      Of course not.  Since it had no discernible physical<br/>effects, it conveniently couldn&apos;t be measured, and his<br/>scam couldn&apos;t be detected...or so he thought, until the Attorney<br/>General of the state of Delaware hauled him in an indicted the<br/>alleged psychic healer for interstate wire fraud.</p><p>     Kraig further averred:</p><p>     &quot;I just use my ear and can hear these things going on.<br/>According to you all this is the arbitary wandering of<br/>people who can&apos;t hear.&quot;</p><p>     No, Kraig, that&apos;s not what I said. I said there is<br/>no evidence of any comprehensible plan to these intonational<br/>vaiants, a plan of the kind John deLaubenfels tried to<br/>embody in a computer program.<br/>     Notice that I don&apos;t claim there isn&apos;t some kind of<br/>system to the intonational variants, just that whatever<br/>it might be we don&apos;t find it comprehensible.<br/>     All that means is that the process by which we select<br/>these intonational variants in real melodies in the real<br/>world is very very V*E*R*Y complex.  It&apos;s so complex we<br/>can&apos;t understand it, even while we&apos;re doing it.<br/>     The human brain is stupefyingly sophisticated, and<br/>we constantly do things we can&apos;t explain. For example,<br/>balancing on one leg.  Try to get a robot to do that.<br/>How about riding your bike without touching the handlebars...<br/>most people can do that for maybe a minute or so. Try to<br/>get a computer to control all the variables in that one.<br/>The computer would melt down.<br/>      How about catching a fly ball in the outfield?  Want<br/>to try to write a computer program to do that?  If the<br/>sun&apos;s in your eyes?  And allyou&apos;ve got in the input from<br/>2 visual sensors (they&apos;re called eyeballs)?<br/>      Good luck.<br/>      The idea that our intonational variants boil down<br/>to something as cartoonish and trivially simple as B&amp;C&apos;s<br/>&quot;extended reference&quot; deeply insults the complexity of<br/>the human brain, in my opinion.</p><p>     When I cited a quote which pointed out that</p><p>&gt; However, there is no generally<br/>&gt; accepted rationale for how it should be done; people have these<br/>&gt; adjustemnts &grave;by ear.&apos; Empirical studies have not, as yet, revealed<br/>&gt; the basis of the practice. But they have demonstrated that no<br/>&gt; explanation in terms of a fixed intervallic scale will match<br/>&gt; the facts;</p><p>    Kraig Grady responded:</p><p>    &quot;That is because scientists have little or no understanding<br/>of what goes on in a work of art. They don&apos;t know what it is<br/>they are looking at in the first place.&quot;</p><p>    Once again, this boils down to the claim &quot;the hypothesis<br/>is untestable.&quot;<br/>    But once again, Kraig, you can&apos;t have it both ways. EITHER<br/>Boomsliter &amp; Creel&apos;s hypothesis involves testable effects, in<br/>which case the other psychoacoustic experiments must be taken<br/>into account, OR Boomsliter &amp; Creel&apos;s hypothesis involves<br/>effects which are not testable... In which case B&amp;C&apos;s results<br/>are worthless.<br/>    If you want to use the language of science, as B&amp;C do<br/>with their mathematics and their statistics, you must use<br/>the methods of science.  One or the other. You can&apos;t have<br/>it both ways.</p><p>    When I cited Nicholas Cook&apos;s statement that:</p><p>&gt; violinists do not play in just intonation, or<br/>&gt; mean-tone intonation, or Pythagorean intonation, any more than<br/>&gt; they play in equal temperament. In other words, they determine<br/>&gt; their intonation in accordance with the individual musical<br/>&gt; context.&quot; [Cook, Nicholas. &quot;Music, Imagination, and Culture,&quot;<br/>&gt; Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1990, pg. 236]</p><p>   Kraig replied:</p><p>   &quot;If you look at an entire sample that is what you will see<br/>unless you can take into account the intent of the music<br/>at each micropoint.&quot;</p><p>    That seems like a valid point. There needs to be a lot<br/>of work done on this issue. Of course, how do you define<br/>a &quot;micropoint&quot;?  Where do you draw the line between phrases<br/>or sections in a melody as performed in the real world so<br/>that we can extract the supposed JI segments as they move<br/>from one extended reference point to another?<br/>     We need to have some provable testable way of doing this...<br/>otherwise, the entire hypothesis is unprovable and therefore<br/>unfalisifiable, and consequently all Boomsliter &amp; Creel&apos;s<br/>talk about math and difference tones is meaningless.</p><p>      When I cited a quote which said:</p><p>&gt; The audience, which included experienced<br/>&gt; musicians,<br/>&gt; had not noticed them at all.&quot; [Zuckerkandl, Victor. &quot;Sound and<br/>&gt; Symbol,&quot;<br/>&gt; Pantheon Books: New York, 1956, pp. 79-81]</p><p>   Kraig Grady replied</p><p>    &quot;Of course we don&apos;t notice them because they are a part of<br/>the language that has taken thousands of years to build up.

If it can&apos;t (as you try to suggest above by claiming<br/>it&apos;s all subconscious), then it uses the language of science<br/>without using the methods of science and is accordingly nothing<br/>more than a musical version of uflology or astrology.</p><p>     When I cited the quote:</p><p>&gt;     &quot;This experimental evidence...does not support<br/>&gt; the classical view, still recently promoted by<br/>&gt; Boomsliter and Creel, that harmony is based on<br/>&gt; frequency ratio itself; that the ear might be<br/>&gt; provided with some sort of frequency-ratio detector.<br/>&gt; (..)

People<br/>were adding thirds to chords when all the theory was<br/>telling them it was dissonant.&quot;</p><p>   The major chord in Western music came from culture<br/>and ideology, Kraig. Our major triad was not created<br/>in order to conform to natural laws which arise from<br/>the harmonic series -- just the opposite, a whole<br/>set of superstitions about supposed &quot;natural laws&quot;<br/>in music allegedly arising from the harmonic series<br/>forced us to create the major triad to conform with<br/>all that ideology.<br/>    The proof is simple an straightforward. Many<br/>other cultures use harmonic-series instruments,<br/>but none of them (NOT ONE!) ever produced the<br/>major triad.  Not even India.<br/>    The major triad *only* arose in Western Europe...<br/>because only in Western Europe did the Greek harmonic<br/>series small integer ideology take hold, and force<br/>the development of a whole superstructure of musical<br/>practice based on those Greek superstitions.</p><p>    More broadly, Kraig&apos;s claim that harmony in<br/>Western music occurred by accretion is the old<br/>msuical fairy tale of &quot;the evolution of harmony&quot;<br/>which supposedly occurs by climbing the members<br/>of the harmonic series...first the octave, then<br/>the perfect fifth, then the major third, then the<br/>7th, etc.<br/>   This evolutionary myth of Western harmony is<br/>a 19th century supersition. It has been debunked<br/>and no serious musical historian or musicologist<br/>in the West believes in it today:</p><p>   &quot;In 1885, Alexander John Ellis, the man who<br/>is generlaly regarded as the father of ethno-<br/>musicology, demonstrated that musical scales are<br/>not natural but highly artificial, and that laws<br/>of acoustics may be irrelevant in the human<br/>organization of sound. In spite of his timely<br/>warning, there are still some...who write as if it<br/>were their task to fill in the gaps of musical history<br/>by describing the musical styles of exotic cultures.<br/>Even if they do not say it in so many words, their<br/>techniques of analysis betray affection for an<br/>evolutionary veiew of music. Musical styles cannot<br/>be heard as stages in the evolution of music,<br/>as judged in terms of one particular civilization&apos;s<br/>concepts ofmusic. Each style has its own history,<br/>and its present state represents only one stage<br/>of its own development; this may have followed a<br/>separate and unique course, although its surface<br/>patterns may suggest contacts with other styles.<br/>   &quot;(..) If our music historian gives the Venda<br/>the credit of producing the heptatonic scale<br/>thesmelves and doesnot assume that they must have<br/>borrowed it from a &grave;higher&apos; culture, I suspect<br/>that he might describe theirmusic as being in a<br/>stage of transition from pentatonic to heptatonic<br/>music -- a fascinating example of musical evolution<br/>in action!  The only trouble about such description<br/>is that social and culture evidence contradicts it.<br/>For example, the Venda used a heptatonic xylophone<br/>and petatonic reed pipes long before they adopted<br/>the pentatonic reed pipes of their southern neighbors,<br/>the Pedi, who in turn say they adopted and adapted the<br/>heptatonic reed pipe msuic of the Venda. According<br/>to evolutionary theires of music history,<br/>the Venda should be going backward -- like the Chinese,<br/>who selected a pentaotnic scale for their msuic<br/>although they knew had used &grave;bigger and better&apos; scales!&quot;<br/>[Blacking, John, &quot;How Musical is Man?&quot; University of<br/>Washington Press: Seattle, 1973, pp. 56-57]</p><p>   The old wive&apos;s tale of the supposed &quot;evolution&quot;<br/>of Western harmony is just as mythical and just<br/>as faulty as old wive&apos;s tales about the alleged<br/>&quot;evolution&quot; of scales. If we look at the history<br/>of Western music, we find jumps and discontinuous<br/>moves back and forth in harmony -- in the<br/>10th and 11th century, unisons and major seconds.<br/>Then a jump to fauxbourdon. Then a jump up in<br/>complexity to polyphony which allows minor<br/>seconds as passing tones as perfect fourths<br/>and perfect fifths during the high Gothic<br/>period...then a jump back to simplicity with<br/>minor seconds and p4ths strongly discouraged<br/>as harmonic intervals, but majr 3rds encouraged<br/>during the Renaissance.<br/>   Then we get 7th chords in the Baroque, but<br/>fewer 7th and dminished and augmented chords<br/>and less chromatic passing tones in the Classical<br/>period.

So we are to turn around and become<br/>patternless, wandering amoebae because some overpaid cartmaker<br/>says that is what we are doing.&quot;</p><p>  This is the classic fallacy of argument by extremes.<br/>Either we must go to one extreme or the other, with nothing<br/>in the middle. &quot;If we don&apos;t tattoo barcodes on everyone&apos;s<br/>forehead, there&apos;ll be anarchy in the streets!&quot;  No, there<br/>is a broad middle ground between the 2 extremes.<br/>   As I pointed out earlier, simlpy because we don&apos;t know<br/>what the pattern is doesn&apos;t mean we must &quot;turn around and<br/>become patternless.&quot;<br/>   The obvious conclusion is that we should instead throw<br/>out simplistic baby-math delusions like Boomsliter &amp; Creel&apos;s<br/>cartoonish scheme and instead make music using our intuition<br/>and our experience and our emotions.</p><p>   And when I cited a quote to the effect that:</p><p>&gt;      &quot;Despite numerological theories going back at least to<br/>&gt; Leibnitz (see Revesz, 1954, p.50), to my knowledge no<br/>&gt; psychologically plausible mechanism has been offered to<br/>&gt; explain how a listener determines that two tones achieve<br/>&gt; or approximate a simple frequency ratio -- particularly<br/>&gt; when the tones are pure sinusoids and are presented only<br/>&gt; successively.&quot; [Shephard, Roger, &quot;Structural Representations<br/>&gt; of Musical Pitch,&quot; in &quot;The Psychology of Music,&quot; ed. Diana<br/>&gt; Deutsch: Academic Press Inc., New York: 1982, pg. 347.]</p><p>    Kraig Grady responded:</p><p>    &quot;Gee I can think of a myriad of individuals that tune JI<br/>by ear.&quot;</p><p>    Kraig, music is not the same thing as tuning. If it were,<br/>audiences would go into a concert hall and listen to the<br/>orcehstra tune up and then applaud and leave and congratulate<br/>each other on how beautiful the music was.<br/>    No one does that.<br/>    Tuning is a completely different process from making music.</p><p>    Kraig Grady went on to claim:</p><p>   &quot;according to all this scintific data on the perception of pitch ,<br/>I see none where listeners attempt to produce an ET like 17 or 22. The<br/>result would be far greater discrpancies than you will get from JI<br/>If the tolerance is so great it seems to me that any mood in an ET<br/>could be done with a constant structure of a JI to a close<br/>approximation.&quot;</p><p>    First, the reason there aren&apos;t experiments which test listeners<br/>against 17 equal or 22 equal is once again ideology. The JI ideology<br/>is marinated into our culture, soaked into our bones.  It&apos;s a Western<br/>Europe/America monomania, not found in any other culture.<br/>    So of course the listening tests in our culture deal exclusively<br/>with comparing 12 equal to JI -- since the musical ideology of our<br/>culture obseesses over JI.  That&apos;s my whole point.  The ideology<br/>bends and warps our thinking so that we deluded ourselves into<br/>fantasizing that the choice is ONLY between JI or 12.  But it isn&apos;t.</p><p>   As for Kraig&apos;s claim that &quot;any mood in an ET could be done with<br/>a constant structure of a JI  to a close approximation...&quot;<br/>   Yes, probably it can, Kraig. But the reverse is equally true.<br/>Any JI limit can be very closely approximated by some sufficiently<br/>large number of equal tones per octave.<br/>   So what? All that proves is that at the extremes, JI tunings<br/>can be approximated by ET tunings, and ET tunings can be approximated<br/>by high JI limits.<br/>   Every competent musician already knows that.  If you push ETs far<br/>enough, you can get &apos;em to sound like JI&apos;s, and if you push the<br/>JI limit high enough you can get it to sound like an ET, and if<br/>you select sufficiently gapped ETs or harmonic series you can<br/>get &apos;em to sound like any inharmonic series.<br/>   All 3 classes of tunings blend into one another at the extremes.</p><p>   When I pointed out:</p><p>&gt; Musicians use various equal divisions<br/>&gt; of the octave for exactly the same reason they use various<br/>&gt; JI tunings...because each tuning has its own remarkable<br/>&gt; musically useful &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;mood&quot; or &quot;sonic fingerprint.&quot;</p><p>   Kraig replied:</p><p>   &quot;These scales only exist because of the computer and they are the<br/>easiest things to do on them. They are not something that can be tuned<br/>by ear and exstemely difficult with even a monchord.&quot;</p><p>   Kraig, that&apos;s just not true.  Middle East musicians have been<br/>using 17 equal and 22 equal for quite a while -- longer before<br/>computers appeared on the scene. In Europe, Bonsanquet and<br/>Ogolevets produced many different ETs. Bosanquet had an<br/>harmonium tuned to 22 equal and he discussed it in one of<br/>his articles, while Ogolevets had harmoniums tuned to 17 equal<br/>adn 29 equal.  19 equal was downright common, appearing<br/>starting in 1835 (Joe Monzo has the British pamphlet discussing<br/>19 equal published in that year) and reappearing at regular<br/>intervals. I just came across an article in a Congress of<br/>Musicology in 1911 in which Melchior Sachs dragged a 19-equal<br/>harmonium into the lecture hall and played excerpts from<br/>Bach in 12 equal and 19 equal.<br/>    So Kraig, musical use of the ETs has been going on long<br/>long before computers.<br/>    Moreover, I don&apos;t think you have used a digital synthesizer<br/>very much, because you will quickly discover that on a digital<br/>synth ALL tunings are equally easy to produce. Fire up SCALA<br/>and you can instantly tune your digital synth to any tuning<br/>whether JI or ET or NJ NET.  It&apos;s equally simple to tune<br/>to any of these systems, Kraig, because in a digital synth<br/>(effectively a dedicated computer) the tunings are just<br/>numbers.<br/>   Perhaps you were thinking of analog synthesizers.  The<br/>old analog synths were strongly biased toward producing ETs,<br/>because on the old analog synths the reistive ladder used<br/>identical value resistors for each key. Thus you could get<br/>any ET very easily by inserting a pot on the keyboard<br/>as a voltage divider.  However, on the old analog synths<br/>you could only get JI pitches by unsoldering and replacing<br/>the resistors for each key, so that made it harder to get<br/>JI.<br/>   But Kraig, the old analog synths are long gone. No<br/>synthesizer company manufactures analog synths any more as<br/>MIDI keyboards -- all MIDI keyboards today are digital<br/>synths, and therefore they&apos;re all equally easy to tune<br/>to *any* type of intonation, JI  or ET or NJ NET.</p><p>   The claim that ETs are difficult to tune with a<br/>monochord is just not true, Kraig. Ivor Darreg produced<br/>many many different fret charts for guitars, and these<br/>are nothing but ways of marking off a monochord with<br/>4 strings.<br/>   All you have to do is mark off the lines on the<br/>monochord (which are very easily calculated, it&apos;s<br/>just 1/x where x is the number of equal tones/octave)<br/>and then sound them.  It&apos;s trivial.</p><p>&gt;        The claim that  &quot;JI is at least a very close<br/>&gt; appoximation to things in nature&quot; is largely false.</p><p>    &quot;Listen to Tuvans sing. The fact is that then we can<br/>tune it by ear and if it doesn&apos;t exist in nature how are<br/>we tuning it!&quot;</p><p>    Kraig, the Tuvan throat-singers are not operating<br/>exclusively according to the laws of nature. Tuvans<br/>are humans.  Humans do what they do because of culture,<br/>not because natural laws force them to behave that<br/>way.  Tuvan chosoe to sing in one way, while Balinese<br/>in their kacapi music choose to sing in a completely<br/>different way. Thai vocalists and Vietnamese vocalists<br/>sing a totally different way.<br/>    Since we are talking about people, Kraig, their<br/>behavior and their actions and the pitches they produce<br/>are determined by culture, not by the physical laws of<br/>nature.</p><p>   When I pointed out:</p><p>&gt; In nature, essentially ALL vibrating objects produce<br/>&gt; INHARMONIC series of vibrations, forming non-just<br/>&gt; non-equal-tempered tunings.  Almost every type of<br/>&gt; vibrating object, whether it is a glass or a spoon<br/>&gt; or a fork or a tire iron or wooden board or a CD<br/>&gt; case or champagne glass or doorknob or a metal<br/>&gt; bracelet or a ceramic tile...ALL of these types<br/>&gt; of vibrating objects produce INHARMONIC series.</p><p>   Kraig Grady claimed:</p><p>   &quot;Add resonators at harmonic degrees and you will<br/>percieve a harmonic series.&quot;</p><p>    Kraig, that&apos;s just not true. By filing and tweaking<br/>some metal bars you can get vague approximations of<br/>parts of a harmonic series, but there are still plenty<br/>of inharmonic tones.</p><p>    When I pointed out:</p><p>&gt;       Only a microscopic minority of exotic and exceptional<br/>&gt; vibrating objects produce HARMONIC series -- namely,<br/>&gt; objects which vibrate in one dimension only.  This<br/>&gt; set of vibrating objects is so small that it boils<br/>&gt; down to 2 exotic types *never* found in nature: thin taut<br/>&gt; strings and hollow tubes with tone holes.</p><p>   Kraig Grady replied:</p><p>   &quot;Our basic instruments or the ones that human beings<br/>have chosen to make instruments out of.&quot;</p><p>    When you say &quot;our,&quot; Kraig youare limiting yourself<br/>to Europe/America.<br/>    Throughout the world, most of the musical instruments<br/>used generate inharmonic timbres. Lithophones, metallophones,<br/>drums, xylophones, wood blocks, you name it -- these are<br/>the instruments most cultures in the world use. Almost<br/>anywhere in the third world most of the music is characterized<br/>by cymbals and whirlies and devil chasers and drums and<br/>chimes.  Brass instruments and violins are very rare,<br/>guitar-like instruments only slightly less so.</p><p>  When I wrote:</p><p>&gt;     As far as dealing with long meters, counting<br/>&gt; does not involve math -- you can count the beats<br/>&gt; in a long meter by beating your fist and after<br/>&gt; a while you will simply get used to the downbeat.</p><p>  Kraig Grady pointed out:</p><p>  &quot;In Ethnomusicaology they have a system of measurement<br/>equivalent to cents for rhythms. All the tests find the<br/>same thing it does with pitch. The beats are not equal nor<br/>are the subdivions of even the simpliest of rhythm patterns.<br/>So you should encourge everyone to dispel the even<br/>beat because it doen&apos;t exist.&quot;</p><p>   Yes!  Exactly!<br/>   Thank you for pointing that out, Kraig.<br/>   Quantization is death. Kill quantization. They<br/>should take quantization out of every MIDI sequencer,<br/>purge it, destroy it. Mark it with big BIOHAZARD<br/>symbols. Get rid of it. Never use quantization in your<br/>MIDI music, it will destroy everything. A regular beat<br/>is the neutron bomb of music.  The music is destroyed<br/>but the notes remain standing. If you have a metronome,<br/>take an axe to it. Burn the bloody thing.  Never ever<br/>practice according to a  metronome. It will destroy your<br/>musical performance.<br/>   Regular even beats are the kiss of death.</p><p>    When I pointed out:</p><p>&gt; Once your muscle memory  takes over in musical<br/>&gt; peformance, trying to count makes you stumble and<br/>&gt; fumble.  You have to *feel* where the beat is,<br/>&gt; not count your way to it.<br/>&gt;     This applies in my experience also with<br/>&gt; complex polyrhythms, which Bill Wesley has taught<br/>&gt; me to produce on his mbira. (Bill can teach anyone<br/>&gt; complex polyrhythms, and quickly too.) Counting gets in<br/>&gt; the way. You have to do it until you feel it. Soon<br/>&gt; you just feel whether the downbeat it...you<br/>&gt; feel the polyrhythm as a single thing, not<br/>&gt; some complicated piece of math.</p><p>   Kraig Grady claimed:</p><p>   &quot;You can feel it because we have sinple relationships<br/> ingrained as gestalts. If it wasn&apos;t there, how could you<br/>feel it?&quot;</p><p>   By using the wonderfully sophisticated and complex<br/>blob of goo inside your skull, 90% of whose operations<br/>you are never aware of.<br/>   Kraig, we can &quot;feel&quot; when we are in the right position<br/>to catch a fly ball in baseball, but the math is hideously<br/>complex. There are no simple relationships, we &quot;feel&quot;<br/>this stuff and seem to do it &quot;naturally&quot; because our<br/>brains are so fabulously sophisticated.<br/>   The entire failure of modern AI and the brick wall<br/>modern vision researchers have hit over the last 30<br/>years proves this.  We &quot;feel&quot; it is very &quot;natural&quot; to<br/>recognize a cat from any angle, in any lighting condition...<br/>but no computer can come close to doing it. The math<br/>is so stupefyingly hard the computer would melt down.<br/>    We do it because our brains are the end result of<br/>4 billion years of continuous Darwinian melee in which<br/>only the cleverest critters survived.<br/>---------<br/>--mclaren</p></div><h3><a id=738 href="#738">ðŸ”—</a>Kraig Grady &#x3C;kraiggrady@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/27/2001 12:20:19 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Brian!<br/>     Well this dialog is fast approaching book or pamphlet proportions.<br/>but in order not to repeat myself and thus you yourself i will try to<br/>restrict my comments to those points which are unclear or un developed.<br/>     First i have two of Boomlitter and Creel Papers and will put up the<br/>63  sometime in the future. The first page i have is just not up to par<br/>and even though i was at UCLA just yesterday i forgot to rexerox this<br/>page. Arrrrgh. Before i go any further let me also stated that i did<br/>what you and i do, actually listen to extended reference examples and<br/>frankly find them not only correct but add a level of depth to the<br/>melodies as well as correctness.</p><p>In no way do i think this is the whole story.</p><p>Those cultures that use JI  from Turkey to India are melodic based with<br/>harmony outside of it language for the most part. And I will agree with<br/>you that Boomliter and Creel only apply to the music of our culture. We<br/>have at least one person looking into the music of turkey with hard<br/>readings and it should be interesting to see what they come up with. But<br/>still i have already stated my problems with such studies as their<br/>limitations are not easy to over come. they need to be done but should<br/>be taken  as a grain of Salt.</p><p>    Gestalt Psychologist have pointed out that if one is presented with<br/>your classic Alice and Wonderland Keyhole design , we see, perceive, a<br/>triangle superimposed with a circle. This does in no way reduce our<br/>brains to the limits of the overly simple. These archetypes are there as<br/>ONE OF THE basic frame of references. The same is true of the Harmonic<br/>series. But my concept of JI is not what you seem to limit it too. As<br/>you know<br/>in my particular case, my interest in JI is not on a<br/>consonance/dissonance level but on a level of JI intervals being less<br/>ambiguous in their meaning, hence there ability to be easily<br/>reproducible by ear.</p><p>To clarify myself though and I say that for  others this ambiguousness<br/>of certain scales might be exactly what a composer wants. but Not I as a<br/>far as myself find JI hard wired in</p><p>I believe that much classical theory is hogwash and find it does exactly<br/>what you say, underestimates the human mind and the human ear. So when i<br/>hear someone say the anything above 13 limit is not worth looking into,<br/>because it can be approximated by some 13/limit ratio, It raises the<br/>hair on my back as a great underestimation or how far we can go and what<br/>we can actually hear. I believe any ratio can exist in a particular<br/>context. If i say the 37th harmonic I will point out it is midway<br/>between the 21/16. Double that octave and you have 32-37-42 a very nice<br/>sounding chord outside of your reductionist JI.  This is just the<br/>simplest of ways JI can be used and is used. In actual music though,<br/>slight variations make all the difference in so much of the emotional<br/>impact of music. You can take two singers  or even the same singer and<br/>one time you can hear them you will think them great and another, well<br/>not as great. If you try to say exactly what was the difference it is in<br/>MANY cases impossible to pinpoint and all the graphs on earth i don&apos;t<br/>think is going to tell us, because we will find this intonation here but<br/>in the other version we will find that same fluctuations somewhere else<br/>if not within such a small degree , we could not imagine it would<br/>matter, but something does and yes it is not always intonation.</p><p>    Now Et is easily tuned on a computer and JI is impossible except for<br/>those that have kyma and some of the better machines. 768, or 1024<br/>divisions are horrible tools for evaluating JI and for this reason i can<br/>understand how they would have little appeal to computer users. While<br/>easy on a computer, ET is not something we can tune up by ear as<br/>complicated as the human mind is.<br/>This points out to me that as complex as the human mind is, it says this<br/>is not the way the we hear.</p><p>Here is where i have a problem, we are letting our machines tell us what<br/>to tune by what is available. No one ever thought of these scales before<br/>because there was no way to do them. These scales are the artifacts of<br/>computers and not the human ear/mind. even 12 et wasn&apos;t available until<br/>a surprisingly recent time and once we got it , that when people started<br/>looking elsewhere because the closer they got the more we wanted to move<br/>away.</p><p>Now this is why i can&apos;t go that route and god i tried cause that&apos;s where<br/>i started, with ET.</p><p> On the other hand MOS and Constant Structure does show a tendency that<br/>when creating  a scale that we humans do like to fill in the gaps and ET<br/>does satisfy this aspect. I will say this is an another musical<br/>Archetype which Et satisfies. And believe in music there are all type of<br/>other archetypal forces and these forces take lesser or greater degree<br/>of importance depending on what the culture one is brought up in<br/>considers important. it is not that these forces are not there, but are<br/>not alone and not always in agreement with each other. I assume that<br/>there are many things left  uncovered and maybe it takes a<br/>scientist/theorist coming from another culture that reacts to these<br/>different archetypes to perceive what we can not. Possibly you are right<br/>in stripping all of the cherished ones away. Granted much has been<br/>overvalued that is limited in it application, but when you have knocked<br/>down all your tower of Babel&apos;s, the best stone for building anything<br/>else might be in the pile of rubble in front of you.</p><p>xed@... wrote:</p><p>&gt; FROM: mclaren<br/>&gt; TO: new practical microtonality list<br/>&gt; SUBJECT: Boomsliter &amp; Creel</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=745 href="#745">ðŸ”—</a>nanom3@...</h3><span>7/27/2001 6:00:11 PM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Kraig and Brian</p><p>I am actively enjoying this lively debate of scholarship.</p><p>There is one sentence that really popped out at me given my interest<br/>in the body</p><p>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;       Only a microscopic minority of exotic and exceptional<br/>&gt; &gt; vibrating objects produce HARMONIC series -- namely,<br/>&gt; &gt; objects which vibrate in one dimension only.
