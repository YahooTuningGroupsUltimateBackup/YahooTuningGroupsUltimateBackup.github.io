They are the colorful<br/>&gt; sea slugs they got in them tide pools down in La Jolla?<br/>&gt; Some of the big purple ones weigh several pounds.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sometimes called sea cows since they &apos;graze&apos; on the<br/>&gt; grass.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; They have got the largest neurons ever found so<br/>&gt; neurobiologists use them for testing and their &apos;brain&apos;<br/>&gt; such as it is is the only one that has been fully<br/>&gt; mapped -- all 87 neurons or whatever # it is.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Anyway, does any one know much about their mating<br/>&gt; habits?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Also, info on mating habits of other mollusks would be<br/>&gt; helpful as well as any advance warnings on any<br/>&gt; contentious issues involved in this field of study. I<br/>&gt; wonder if the conches have to come out of their shells<br/>&gt; to mate or how that works...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Thanks,<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3><a id=790 href="#790">ðŸ”—</a>X.

I agree with you,<br/>but the thing is that the human wetware is so complex<br/>it will be some time before we understand it all and<br/>upload it to a cyborg for further analysis and study.</p><p>In the meantime, we can start small to understand the<br/>basic principles involved and build up from there. This<br/>is part of my research with the nudibranch simulations.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
