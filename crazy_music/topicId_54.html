Here&apos;s a pointer to &quot;Keykit&quot; for<br/>those who don&apos;t know about it.  It&apos;s an interpreted GUI &amp; Object-oriented<br/>language for music composition &amp; performance with MIDI.  I have used it on<br/>occasion for a few things.  It&apos;s free (you just have to register).</p><p>&#x9;<a href="http://www.nosuch.com/tjt/software.html">http://www.nosuch.com/tjt/software.html</a></p><p>Recently, the author posted an excerpt of code as an example of real-time<br/>note filtering.  That means, it could be set up for doing real-time<br/>pitch-bending, etc.  This would be a nice way to do on-the-fly retuning,<br/>without having to parse all the MIDI messages, etc, oneself.  The Keykit<br/>language takes care of all the low-level grunge, and is multi-threaded &amp;<br/>real-time controllable.</p><p>&#x9;Rick</p></div>
