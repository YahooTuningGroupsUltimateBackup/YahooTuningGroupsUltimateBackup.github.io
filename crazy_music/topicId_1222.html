The music ebbs and flows<br/>between deeply reflective and highly animated moods, and between<br/>straightforward and intricately interwoven textures.  These pieces begin<br/>from<br/>the raga format, but evolve according to the in-the-moment emotional pulse<br/>and interplay.  Since the Oct.26th concert coincides with the huge anti-war<br/>rally<br/>in Washington D.C., we would like to dedicate it and the Oct.23rd one as<br/>well<br/>to the principle of working to create peace through non-violent cooperation.<br/>We would agree with one wise soul who has said that war is a failure of the<br/>imagination.<br/>Both Lawrence and Lisa have been improvising and composing for over 30<br/>years.<br/>Lawrence has recorded almost 2000 pieces of distinctive piano explorations,<br/>the<br/>hallmark of his repertoire.  He is also the director of the Planet Tree<br/>Music<br/>Festival<br/>in London which has presented new and exciting musical programs since 1996.<br/>Lisa Sangita who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area specializes in playing<br/>her</p><p>electric sarod (a one-of-a-kind adaptation of the traditional classical<br/>Indian<br/>sarod)<br/>in unusual contexts, but has found the greatest satisfaction in the<br/>combination<br/>of<br/>sarod with chordal instruments.  She studied with maestro Ali Akbar Khan for<br/>more than 15 years.  The timbres of sarod and piano are quite similar, but<br/>they</p><p>differ widely in the way they express themselves (piano being a very<br/>harmonic<br/>instrument and sarod being more strictly melodic).   Together they create a<br/>whole<br/>new musical language.</p><p>&quot; contemplative... capable of transporting listeners into hypnotic reveries<br/>rife with ingenious improvisations and ever-mounting creative energy<br/>a sonic mix that promises enthralling melodies and rapturous rhythms.&quot;<br/>          Derk Richardson     The East Bay Express</p><p>=====<br/><a href="http://www.lisamoskow.com">http://www.lisamoskow.com</a><br/><a href="http://home.attbi.com/~mihman/lisa/">http://home.attbi.com/~mihman/lisa/</a></p><p><a href="http://www.planettree.org">http://www.planettree.org</a><br/><a href="http://www.visualharmony.org">http://www.visualharmony.org</a></p></div>
