Well, on re-listening, I guess the pitch is<br/>&gt; pretty clear, but it seems diffused somehow - can you<br/>&gt; describe the makeup of this voice?</p><p>Off the top of my head I recall that it is structured<br/>like a marimba but I have one of the (FM) modulation<br/>stacks controllable &amp; that stack also has some vibrato<br/>in it that makes the odd wavering sound. Towards the<br/>end of the piece, I reduce the amplitude of that<br/>modulation stack and the voice morphs into the marimba<br/>that is its base.</p><p>I&apos;ll look at it again later; it&apos;s a voice I made a few<br/>years ago.</p><p>&gt; Oh... my mistake; you describe them as struck, not plucked!</p><p>Only since the voice seems like a marimba to me but<br/>both have similar attack envelopes. I guess the main<br/>difference between the two would be as you say the<br/>inharmonic partials in many typical struck instruments<br/>(excepting clavichords, pianos and other struck<br/>strings.. oh well that&apos;s another topic.)</p><p>&gt; OK, and I&apos;m vaguely hearing inharmonic partials in there,<br/>&gt; consistent with struck instruments.</p><p>Me too.</p><p>&gt;  You do something, though<br/>&gt; (tinker with the pitches during the (short) lifetime of the<br/>&gt; sound?) to make it sound like water drops.</p><p>That&apos;s the erratic pitch modulation.</p><p>&gt; Hmmm... no, on<br/>&gt; listening again, I don&apos;t hear that, but it sure made me<br/>&gt; _imagine_ that I&apos;d heard it.</p><p>I probably fooled you when I subtlely removed it at the<br/>end.</p><p>&gt; Caves are strange places.  Have you been to Carlsbad Caverns?</p><p>Yes!</p><p>&gt; Majestic and frightening, very intense feeling walking down a<br/>&gt; steep path into the bowels of the earth.</p><p>Nice yes but I thought overdeveloped with the<br/>sidewalks, handrails, radio handsets and enormous<br/>cafeteria at the bottom. In the same park nearby<br/>they have small tours (for those able to make a<br/>1/2 mile steep hike) to a nearby undeveloped smaller<br/>cave that is really everything I would expect in a<br/>cave -- many intricate beautiful and colorful<br/>formations -- curtains, shields, christmas trees.<br/>Some of the formations are quite unique and had yet<br/>to be explained when I visited.</p><p>&gt; Actually I can<br/>&gt; imagine playing your piece there, loud enough that people<br/>&gt; around can hear - I want to see their expressions!</p><p>!!</p><p>Thanks again!</p><p>---</p><p>OH! BY THE WAY -- to those of you having trouble<br/>downloading, just wait an hour or so and try again.<br/><a href="http://geocities.com">geocities.com</a> blocks accounts on an hourly basis<br/>depending on whether downloads in that hour have<br/>exceeded 3 gigabytes / (30 days * 24 hours) = 4.17<br/>MB/hour. So only about four minutes of music total<br/>worldwide can be downloaded per hour, unfortunately.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div><h3><a id=1154 href="#1154">ðŸ”—</a>X. J.

SWEET! How do you do<br/>&gt; it?!!!</p><p>Thanks for the comments on Reperio which indeed is a<br/>sweet and intriguing tuning but actually the caves<br/>piece is in another tuning. I did not say what it is<br/>because I am starting to become of the philosophy that<br/>all thisn talk about what tuning is used and blah blah<br/>blah is totally pointless and has no bearing or<br/>relevance on the music but is instead an insidious<br/>distraction that opens the door to focusng on numbers<br/>and math instead of what matters -- the music.</p><p>&gt; I got the piece and cycle played it about 50 times in a row,<br/>&gt; I was so starved from some of them good ole Jeff Scott<br/>&gt; Micreetones!</p><p>&gt; Yeee Haaa! Ummm ummm goood.</p><p>&gt; Keep&apos;em coming!</p><p>I&apos;d like to. I do get discouraged sometimes I must<br/>admit. So many thanks to all the words of encouragement<br/>and feedback.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
