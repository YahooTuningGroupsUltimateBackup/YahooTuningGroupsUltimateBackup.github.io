Their use<br/>of pitch is based on their language. Also as i pointed out, as with<br/>indonesian instruments, rougher intervals are louder hence can be heard<br/>at a greater distance. As i also pointed out consonance dissonance is<br/>not in their musical language. The intervals of their scales appear to<br/>have an equality of roughness, allowing a counterpuntal language that is<br/>freer in combining melodic lines.<br/>    One other thing- due to the shape of their bars, i have found that<br/>electronic instruments will not read the pitch of Balophone accurately,<br/>finding every pitch in a particular range reading as being &quot;right on&quot;. I<br/>have had to resort to a monochord and go by what i was hearing as the<br/>pitch.</p><p>In reference to previous post</p><p>For those interested in a gestalt approach to the visual arts, I<br/>recommend the books by Rudolf Arnheim.
