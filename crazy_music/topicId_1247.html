It&apos;s all set to go<br/>with both VST and Audio Unit and many other plugin types - seems they have<br/>every known plugin standard on both Mac and PC covered now.</p><p>This softsynth has the ability to emulate many Yamaha synthesizers and can<br/>even read their sysex format. But it also has extended features, such as<br/>resonant multimodal filters, elaborate looping envelopes, waveshaping, and<br/>unlimited algorithm arrangements. It also can accept real-time external<br/>audio as input to it&apos;s operators (oscillators), allowing for really bizarre<br/>effects.</p><p>Tuning Features<br/>---------------</p><p>It also has three forms of microtonal retuning.</p><p>First there is a bank of 12 note scales. They can be stretched and thus<br/>don&apos;t need to be octave repeating. There is a graphical editor. Scales can<br/>be saved in any slot in the bank. There are many scales you can not make<br/>with this feature, but the most common and popular scales can easily be put<br/>together here.</p><p>Next, there is full keyboard arbitrary retuning where any key can be set to<br/>any frequency you like, allowing for just about anything like reverse<br/>tunings or kalimba patches tuned like the keys on a kalimba are actually set<br/>out (they don&apos;t just go bass to treble left to right). This full-keyboard<br/>tuning feature uses the MIDI Manufacturer&apos;s Association official standard<br/>for microtonality -- the MIDI Tuning Standard (MTS). The tuning resolution<br/>is an astonishing 0.006 cents, better than just about any other standard.<br/>MTS messages can be created with many different softwares, such as my own<br/>Li&apos;l Miss&apos; Scale Oven on the Mac, and also with Scala on the PC, and also<br/>Fractal Tune Smithy on the PC.</p><p>When you load in one of these scales, the name of the scale appears in the<br/>tuning bank, confirming that it has been loaded. It stays in place when you<br/>switch patches. Every separate instance of the FM7 you open up (such as as<br/>an independent plugin) can be tuned to a separate and different scale, so<br/>you have quite a bit of versatility here.</p><p>The third retuning protocol supported is single note tuning messages, also<br/>part of the MIDI standard. This has the theoretical possibility to enable<br/>one to play scales with infinite numbers of notes if one wants. I believe<br/>that the FM7 is the only softsynth that supports this advanced capability.</p><p>All in all, the tuning capabilities of the FM7 far surpass those of any<br/>other softsynths that have been as yet released. They also work quite well<br/>and are easy to use.</p><p>Other features<br/>--------------<br/>All parameters on the FM7 can be assigned to MIDI controllers and automated,<br/>so you have really a huge amount of sound control with this instrument.</p><p>There are many libraries on the internet with patches for old Yamaha<br/>instruments, so right of the bat you have access to tens of thousands of<br/>patches.</p><p>Cons<br/>----<br/>There are only two issues in which things aren&apos;t ideal. When running in<br/>standalone mode, you are stuck with one instance, You can&apos;t open 8 instances<br/>at once on different channels like you could with the OS 9 version. Also,<br/>the instance that you get is in OMNI mode, receiving on all 16 midi<br/>channels. You can&apos;t assign it to just one channel. These problems are not<br/>relevant when running the FM7 as a plugin, just when in standalone mode. The<br/>other thing that is slightly inconvenient is that, unlike the 12 note<br/>scales, you can&apos;t save your full keyboard tunings with your sound banks. But<br/>even with these restrictions, this synth still has the best microtuning<br/>implementation that&apos;s out there.</p><p>Performance<br/>-----------<br/>I set the latency to 2ms on the driver and let me tell you this instrument<br/>is sharp quick and responsive. The latency is actually much better and more<br/>consistent on the softsynth than on the original Yamaha DX7II hardware.</p><p>The code is real efficient -- you can set the polyphony to 64 voices if you<br/>want and slam down on the entire keyboard while holding sustain and it<br/>doesn&apos;t even hit 25% of the CPU on a creaky year-old Mac. I can only imagine<br/>what the cpu load is on a modern g5 -- probably it doesn&apos;t even register.<br/>You can pretty much do unlimited polyphony with these things, enabling you<br/>to do real-time rendering of massive &apos;wall of sound&apos; sort of effects.</p><p>Summary<br/>-------<br/>Recommended. They retail for $299 but you can find them for a bit less than<br/>that if you shop around, competitive with the price of an old Yamaha box on<br/>ebay.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
