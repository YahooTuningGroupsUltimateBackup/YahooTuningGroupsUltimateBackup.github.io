Even new music operas<br/>put on by the San Diego Opera were well recieved, enjoyed by<br/>the audience, and played to fairly well packed houses.</p><p>If I want to take someone to an enjoyable concert of academic<br/>music, there are plenty of resources and venues available to<br/>hear stuff that is not embarassing.</p><p>This is why new music has not collapsed.</p><p>It&apos;s alive and thriving.</p><p>There&apos;s good stuff out there.</p><p>- Jeff</p></div>
