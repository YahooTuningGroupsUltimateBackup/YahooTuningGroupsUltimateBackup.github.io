Please be patient<br/>while I put that one together.</p><p>&gt; From: &lt;xed@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:crazy_music@yahoogroups.com">crazy_music@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 10, 2001 7:37 AM<br/>&gt; Subject: [crazy_music] John deLaubenfels&apos; public lies<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>&gt;     For Helmholtz&apos;s central thesis, that musical dissonance is a<br/>&gt; matter of auditory physiology and can be explained by beats, is<br/>&gt; clearly and audibly false.<br/>&gt;     I have uploaded a short segment of a 41-limit just intonation<br/>&gt; tone cluster composition that shows how clearly and how obviously<br/>&gt; false Helmholtz&apos;s central thesis was.  My composition contains<br/>&gt; massive gargantuan numbers of beats -- colossal numbers of beats in<br/>&gt; the range Helmholtz proscribed...  Yet this remains one of my most<br/>&gt; popular compositions ever, judging by listener reaction.<br/>&gt;     So much for Helmholtz&apos;s foolish and provably false &quot;central<br/>&gt; thesis&quot; that beats are responsible for musical dissonance.</p><p>So you&apos;re saying &quot;popular = not dissonant&quot;?</p><p>Come on, Brian.  The popularity of your composition says<br/>nothing whatsoever about Helmholtz&apos;s thesis on dissonance.<br/>How do you even connect the two?  I&apos;m pretty sure that *you&apos;ve*<br/>noticed by now that a *lot* of people really love highly<br/>dissonant music... you and I both included in that group.</p><p>Just because listeners *like* dissonance doesn&apos;t mean that<br/>it&apos;s no longer dissonance... or does it?  The terms &quot;consonance&quot;<br/>and &quot;dissonance&quot; have already proven so slippery that I think<br/>at this point it&apos;s futile to argue about them.</p><p>(And these varying conceptions of &quot;dissonance&quot; and the<br/>resulting misunderstanding at the root of my last response to<br/>you, regarding Schoenberg.  You&apos;ll see more on that soon.)</p><p>&gt; Once Stravinsky produced those tone clusters in &quot;Rite of Spring,&quot; no one<br/>&gt; could un-write &apos;em.  Once Ussachevksy &amp; Luening produced their first<br/>&gt; tape pieces in 1953, no one could un-record &apos;em...despite the best<br/>&gt; efforts of the John deLaubenfelses of the world.</p><p>Brian, your points here about tone clusters and tape pieces are true<br/>and well-noted, but I really think you&apos;ve got a vast misunderstanding<br/>of what deLaubenfels is doing.  And besides, he *always* points out<br/>that his work is based on his own personal preferences which may<br/>not necessarily hold for other people.  You&apos;re taking his work out<br/>of context by implying that he is seeking general overarching<br/>principles which &quot;should&quot; apply to all music, and given his<br/>statements to the contrary, that&apos;s unfair.</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3><a id=271 href="#271">ðŸ”—</a>John A. deLaubenfels &#x3C;jdl@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/10/2001 9:19:27 AM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>First of all, there is one thing I want to acknowledge.  I would&apos;ve<br/>said this straight to you (mclaren) in private e-mail long ago, but you<br/>cleverly blocked me from ever e-mailing you again, apparently because<br/>your blocking program detected words you had leveled at me, and thought<br/>that I was applying them to you.  But, in any case: it _is_ true that<br/>at least one person on the PM list, before its demise, used very harsh<br/>words against you, after one of your, uhhh, passionate posts.<br/>&quot;Character assassination&quot;, if you will.</p><p>I get the feeling that those words are burned in your mind.</p><p>Are you as vividly aware of the words _you_ wrote?  Surely you can see<br/>that this other person&apos;s clumsy attempts to insult are not of the same<br/>caliber as your own?  In put-downs, you are a master.  And you are not<br/>shy about invoking your talent, on PM or here (or anywhere?).  One time,<br/>please try reading one of your own posts as if it had been written by<br/>someone else, against you.  We all are capable of hurting, you know; you<br/>aren&apos;t the only mortal.</p><p>Now, as to a bit of what you wrote:</p><p>&gt;Accordingly, we need not take seriously anything John deLaubenfels says<br/>&gt;from now on.</p><p>What a cop-out!  It sounds to me as if you&apos;re setting yourself up for<br/>rationalizing the idea that you never need listen to my work (since,<br/>apparently, you already &quot;know&quot; it is wrong-headed).  Hey, for that, one<br/>needs no excuse: just blow it off if you want to.  Let others talk about<br/>it; you need never join in unless you choose to.</p><p>&gt;Why are you using the internet, deLaubenfels?</p><p>Unlike you, I _love_ the internet.  Don&apos;t tell me you&apos;ve forgotten your<br/>own condemnation of it?</p><p>&gt;Has deLaubenfels even listened to one (1) of the compositions<br/>&gt;mentioned above?</p><p>No, I&apos;m not able to download .mp3&apos;s from Yahoo: with my slow dial-up<br/>connection, Yahoo cuts off the download after a few minutes, only<br/>partway into the file.  If you would like to mail me a CD, I _will_<br/>listen to it and offer my honest reaction, either on-list or off.</p><p>&gt;Straight out of central casting, here comes this relic from the<br/>&gt;Victorian era who gives us the absolutely cliched classic Victorian<br/>&gt;musical party line, parrotting every single 19th century acoustic fairy<br/>&gt;tale and every single long-disproven antique Victorian old wive&apos;s tale<br/>&gt;dredged up from those kicky wacky 19th century music textbooks.</p><p>I think that perhaps you&apos;re confused.  I like JI; the Victorians liked<br/>12-tET, no?  I _do_ like diatonic music; is that a sin in your book?</p><p>&gt;John deLaubenfels has finally claimed the brass ring.</p><p>No, that honor most certainly belongs to _you_.  Is this how you want<br/>to be remembered after you&apos;re gone?  None of us can take back the<br/>hateful and hurtful things we&apos;ve already said (and I&apos;ve said my share),<br/>but we have full choice of how we will conduct ourselves in the future.</p><p>JdL</p></div>
