You can actually have 8 separate USB devices running at once,<br/>each with its own MIDI data processor.</p><p>This is something that will be really awesome used with softsynths.</p><p>Could also be great for interactive sound installations in parks and other<br/>site installations.</p><p>Fun!</p><p>- J</p></div>
