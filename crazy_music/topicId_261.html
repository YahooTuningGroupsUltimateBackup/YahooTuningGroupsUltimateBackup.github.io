( I know 62 cents is stretching, oops shrinking, the<br/>idea of semitone quite a bit). I assumed others also share this love<br/>like Archytas.<br/>    In the tetrachordal combinations with the 9/8 and 8/7 I have spent<br/>countless hours that few other tetrachords have rivaled. One other come<br/>close (including inversions) Just for those who like to wallow in such<br/>objects of pure beauty.</p><p>7/6 12/11 22/21</p><p>BTW both of these can be found in the 22 tone Eikosany 1-3-7-9-11-15.<br/>The further advantage of such a condensed array of pitch organization is<br/>that you always have such peripheral added features.</p><p>monz wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hi Margo,<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; It&apos;s very interesting to me that right at this moment you<br/>&gt; sent this detailed post about the 28:27 ratio.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I began a post on the tuning list a couple of days ago<br/>&gt; in answer to a question posed by Alison Monteith about<br/>&gt; ancient Greek &quot;higher-limit&quot; ratios.
