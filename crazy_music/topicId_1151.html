I&apos;ve waited a<br/>bit to reply in case others might have comments to make which my reply<br/>might unduly influence &lt;grin&gt;, but now seems like a good time.</p><p>&gt; By the way, I only can download 45 seconds of each song (this is the<br/>&gt; typical yahoo situation for me) so these comments only apply to the<br/>&gt; first 3/4 minute of each piece.</p><p>While I&apos;m sorry about the download programs, that sounds like a very<br/>fair sample.</p><p>&gt; First here are my wife&apos;s comments:</p><p>&gt; 14th C improv is &quot;Cute. I like it. It sounds like it has that<br/>&gt; medievally thing happening.&quot; How about the tuning? &quot;It sounds<br/>&gt; fine. It&apos;s a little bit different but doesn&apos;t sound weird or<br/>&gt; anything.&quot;</p><p>Please thank her for this feedback, and also for the next candid<br/>remarks:</p><p>&gt; Chowning improv is &quot;The first part was annoying. I guess she was<br/>&gt; just playing with the tones. Dee, doo, dee, doo, dee, doo dee<br/>&gt; ... dah dum dah dum dah dum dah.  Not as interesting as the first.&quot;</p><p>That feels like a very fair comment, and I say this as the performer.<br/>She also raises an important for various kinds of styles, xenharmonic<br/>or otherwise. What I was basically doing was starting with some<br/>favorite &quot;standard progressions&quot; -- neo-medieval ones, in my case --<br/>and trying out some riffs and changes, so to speak.</p><p>With this kind of thing, one person&apos;s beloved &quot;old standard&quot; can be<br/>another person&apos;s annoying cliche. What&apos;s very perceptive about the<br/>criticism is that I was indeed &quot;playing with the tones&quot; in some very<br/>familiar patterns.</p><p>Maybe, in a way, I have an initial &quot;advantage&quot; with some listeners<br/>that what&apos;s very familiar to me in terms of neo-medieval styles and<br/>tunings might not be so familiar to them, but rather &quot;new&quot; or<br/>&quot;different.&quot; However, the opening was indeed dwelling on something I<br/>find lovely but also quite conventional, and it&apos;s good for a composer<br/>or improviser to acknowledge this.</p><p>Incidentally, in a certain curious way, maybe this piece draws some<br/>inspiration from Miles Davis and his group in _Kinda Blue_, although I<br/>don&apos;t mean to imply any comparison with the artistry of that album.</p><p>&gt; Here are mine:</p><p>&gt; On first listen, I found the 14th to be more odd in tuning that<br/>&gt; Chowning -- the Chowning piece sounded more conventional to me.</p><p>This is very interesting, and maybe I&apos;ll reserve more comment until a<br/>bit more time has gone by for anyone else who might be inclined to<br/>respond.</p><p>&gt; On second listen, the tunings normalized to my ears (this is what<br/>&gt; usually happens for me). I liked the cadences in the 14th piece. All<br/>&gt; the chord progressions in both pieces I found to be striking and of<br/>&gt; great interest as they &apos;tickled&apos; my ears. I like what you are doing<br/>&gt; in these pieces.</p><p>Thanks for this feedback, and I&apos;ll respond further on some of the<br/>points raised here.</p><p>&gt; - Jeff</p><p>In peace and love,</p><p>Margo</p></div>
