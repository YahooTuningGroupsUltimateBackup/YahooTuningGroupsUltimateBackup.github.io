In some of these he uses the wolf fifth<br/>&gt; deliberately as a vibrant discordance, to add musical excitement and<br/>&gt; verve.  The effect proves musically striking.</p><p>Not a bit surprised about that!  If anyone absolutely *loves*<br/>&quot;vibrant discordance&quot;, it&apos;s Bill!  Those who think they know<br/>what the phrase &quot;a sound that grates on the ears&quot; means,<br/>need to listen to Bill&apos;s Rectifier pieces.   ;-)</p><p>&gt;    However, I hear a radical and complete Grand Canyon chasm between<br/>&gt; the systems of equal temperaments a melodic modes and all that other<br/>&gt; stuff Dan posts about, and the actual sound-world of his music, which<br/>&gt; hits me more like an LSD overdose at the bottom of a swimming pool<br/>&gt; while inhaling helium and doing the backstroke through psychedlic<br/>&gt; Jell-O.</p><p>Whew!  I think I need some air after that one!  More great imagery,<br/>Brian.</p><p>&gt;    For that matter, Joe Monzo, why don&apos;t you give us a detailed step-<br/>&gt; by-step description of how you compose your music?</p><p>OK... I&apos;m game.  But it will have to wait a day or two.  It&apos;s<br/>necessary that I put my paper on Dowland&apos;s tuning into proper<br/>form for publication so&apos;s I can mail it off pronto, or it won&apos;t<br/>appear in print.</p><p>Hey Brian, since you&apos;re not on the &quot;Alternative Wanking List&quot;<br/>(and others here also may not be), you don&apos;t know about my<br/>update to my Dowland page.  Now there&apos;s an mp3 of the first<br/>section of Downland&apos;s famous _Lachrimae_ (which a friend I was<br/>explaining this to last night likened to the &quot;Stairway of Heaven&quot;<br/>of its time because of its popularity).  You&apos;re going to *love*<br/>the wild discords Dowland gets from some wolf intervals (one<br/>typical &quot;5th&quot; is ~682 cents - ouch!), and even from some<br/>~20-cent near-misses of octaves!<br/><a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/fngrbds/dowland/dowland.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/fngrbds/dowland/dowland.htm</a></p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/5/2001 11:00:05 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>I wrote:</p><p>&gt; ... the  &quot;Stairway of Heaven&quot; of its time</p><p>Oops!
