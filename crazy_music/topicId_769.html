These being Ancient Greece, India, the<br/>Persians and Europe. These are the places that JI is used or at least<br/>has  acted as a model that is strived for in some fashion. The Far East<br/>has examples of Pythagorean but i know of no higher. There is one more<br/>possible occurrence which i will go into. From oral tradition i have<br/>heard of various native american people (who for the most part refer to<br/>THEMSELVES as indians now) in former times singing their songs with the<br/>women of the tribes holding high drones. After the drone (which was<br/>supposed to be rhythmic and layered) the men would start melodies in<br/>there range either on a unison or it occurring within the first few<br/>notes. Paying these melodies in this fashion (with a drone) had lead me<br/>to play the melodies using subharmonic scales as the most logical<br/>choices looking at the pitches being used.<br/>    The rest of the world appears to no use JI. Since you brought up the<br/>great Indonesian traditions, let me state one very practical reason JI<br/>would not be something they would want. One of the first acoustical<br/>properties of JI is a decrease in volume. Now if the function of your<br/>music is to be performed for large ensembles with large audiences, beats<br/>add to the volume of group and JI would make it harder to here. It has<br/>been observed that the evolution of instruments has been the history of<br/>louder instruments replacing softer ones.<br/>If you have a scale where each note beat relatively the same, then you<br/>have a scale where each tone has the same dissonance or consonance<br/>degree. The result of such a scale is a counterpoint is based purely on<br/>the melodic lines themselves unhampered by the burden of degrees of<br/>harmonic tension.<br/>    One of the things the Indonesian traditions share with Europe is<br/>Modulation. Ptolemy pointed out how modulation was related to a crisis<br/>of a character and in indonesia, it is used as a change of character.<br/>Even in cultures that don&apos;t change there scale thematic material is<br/>transposed to different places, starting on different steps. Modulation<br/>i would venture is Archetypal in Character. As a dynamic force behind<br/>meantone as well as the various temperments.<br/>    As i mentioned also the tendency to fill it gaps within a scale<br/>is what i attributed one of the qualities of ET&apos;s. Wilson considers MOS<br/>and Constant structures related to the archetype as a dynamic force<br/>influencing how and why we make music. Even with Pelog, singers fill in<br/>the large intervals with smaller steps.<br/>    I think many of the things that Brian brought up are archetypal<br/>forces too, the changes in intonations when melodic lines ascend and<br/>descend.<br/>     These archetypes just to name a few interact in different degrees<br/>of musical Alchemy and produce a myriad of different music. Each informs<br/>the other. It is easy to see how ET or the desire to fill in melodic<br/>gaps (which by the way allows transposition of melodic material to<br/>places where it is easily recognizable) has an effect on JI. Some seem<br/>to have trouble seeing how ratios influence how we perceive ETs or why<br/>they have the moods they do. There are of course other factors and we<br/>should keep our nose and and ears out for any hint of unrecognized<br/>influential forces.<br/>    Let me know if i am leaving out one of your points because although<br/>it is common to &quot;pretend it wasn&apos;t said&quot; as a tactic of many (i am not<br/>thinking of Brian at this point) in dealing in like discussion.</p><p>mschulter wrote:</p><p>&gt; Hello, there, everyone, and please let me thank Brian and Kraig and<br/>&gt; Mary and Bob and others for a dialogue on musical style and small<br/>&gt; integer ratios which suggests to me that a bit of historical<br/>&gt; background might put this &quot;debate&quot; in a different perspective.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;</p><p>-- Kraig Grady<br/>North American Embassy of Anaphoria island<br/> <a href="http://www.anaphoria.com">http://www.anaphoria.com</a></p><p>The Wandering Medicine Show<br/>Wed. 8-9 KXLU 88.9 fm</p></div><h3>monz &#x3C;joemonz@...&#x3E;</h3><span>7/29/2001 11:13:16 PM</span><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>&gt; From: mschulter &lt;MSCHULTER@...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: &lt;<a href="mailto:crazy_music@yahoogroups.com">crazy_music@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sent: Saturday, July 28, 2001 11:36 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: [cm] &quot;Debate&quot; background -- A day of music<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hello, there, everyone, and please let me thank Brian and Kraig and<br/>&gt; Mary and Bob and others for a dialogue on musical style and small<br/>&gt; integer ratios which suggests to me that a bit of historical<br/>&gt; background might put this &quot;debate&quot; in a different perspective.</p><p>Hello, Margo, and thanks for a wonderfully detailed account of<br/>historical tuning trends which offers a fresh viewpoint to those<br/>usually encountered.</p><p>While it would be my pleasure to respond in detail to everything<br/>you wrote, I don&apos;t wish to write such a long posts to these lists<br/>... this time, anyway.  :)   So please permit me to comment on<br/>some selected sections of your article.</p><p>----</p><p>&gt; Of course, since sharing new music is a major theme of this group, I<br/>&gt; can&apos;t resist the opportunity to include a piece I wrote back in 1985,<br/>&gt; in a 13th-century European kind of style: _Homage to Joyce Ball_, then<br/>&gt; a librarian at the local university library.<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt; MIDI: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/library1.mid">http://value.net/~mschulter/library1.mid</a>&gt;<br/>&gt; Score in PostScript: &lt;<a href="http://value.net/~mschulter/library1.ps">http://value.net/~mschulter/library1.ps</a>&gt;</p><p>I don&apos;t have a way (or know how) to read PostScript files,<br/>but I did a tiny bit of &quot;surgery&quot; on your MIDI-file to discover<br/>the tuning, and want to let everyone else in on it: it&apos;s<br/>a very basic 3^(-1...5) F-C-G-D-A-E-B Pythagorean diatonic tuning.</p><p>-----</p><p>&gt; As someone who often uses Pythagorean tuning, or Pythagorean-based JI<br/>&gt; systems combining ratios of 2-3-7, I obviously see a role for integer<br/>&gt; ratios, both large and small.</p><p>For those who may be unfamiliar with Margo&apos;s approach, I&apos;ve made<br/>some webpages of a few of her detailed tuning list posts, which<br/>explain her tunings using prime-factors 2, 3 and 7.

I&apos;d like to note two very minor quibbles<br/>(which, according to your &quot;one day&quot; scale, amounts to a discrepancy<br/>of about 3 hours), which, based on their opposite conclusions,<br/>actually support your arbitrary starting point of 800 AD:</p><p>1)<br/>I believe that the _enchiriadis_  treatises were written quite a bit<br/>earlier (c. 750-800) than the dates proposed by most scholars.<br/>(Over a period of several years I worked at various times on a paper<br/>about this, but it is still in progress.)</p><p>2)<br/>At least one person has presented evidence that some supposedly<br/>&quot;earliest&quot; European music-theory treatises were actually written<br/>well after 900.</p><p>See Paul Anthony Luke Boncella (Taberg, NY): &quot;Toward a New Chronology<br/>of the Enchiriadis Canon and the Pseudo-Hucbaldian De Harmonica<br/>Institutione&quot;, delivered at the Thursday afternoon session (7 November)<br/>of the American Musicological Society [AMS] 1996 Annual Meeting.  The<br/>abstract published at &lt;<a href="http://www.peabody.jhu.edu/ams96/abstract.html">http://www.peabody.jhu.edu/ams96/abstract.html</a>&gt;:</p><p>&gt;&gt; At least five important treatises expounding the theory and<br/>&gt;&gt; practice of Frankish-Gregorian liturgical chant are generally<br/>&gt;&gt; thought to have been written sometime between the dates of<br/>&gt;&gt; Musica disciplina of Aurelianus Reomensis (from the 840s,<br/>&gt;&gt; perhaps even the 820s) and Epistola de harmonica institutione<br/>&gt;&gt; of Regino Prumiensis (ca. 901). All five of the discourses under<br/>&gt;&gt; consideration here have been ascribed (at one time or another)<br/>&gt;&gt; to Hucbald, but today only one of them retains an attribution<br/>&gt;&gt; to the famous monk of St. Amandus (De harmonica institutione).<br/>&gt;&gt; The other four treatises--constituting a group that has long<br/>&gt;&gt; enjoyed the status of a canon--are now usually regarded as works<br/>&gt;&gt; by anonymous musicians (Musica enchiriadis, Scholica enchiriadis,<br/>&gt;&gt; Alia musica, and Commemoratio brevis).<br/>&gt;&gt;<br/>&gt;&gt; The current view of the dating and authorship of these treatises<br/>&gt;&gt; is in need of revision; this will be shown in part through a<br/>&gt;&gt; comparison of De harmonica institutione and Musica enchiriadis.<br/>&gt;&gt; In fact, one of these two works clearly represents an attempt<br/>&gt;&gt; to remedy manifest shortcomings of the other; it is possible,<br/>&gt;&gt; thus, to establish the order in which they were written. Also,<br/>&gt;&gt; recent discoveries elucidating the genesis of Occidental<br/>&gt;&gt; modality indicate that these two discourses must have been<br/>&gt;&gt; written well after the beginning of the 10th century. Finally,<br/>&gt;&gt; Hucbald could not have written either of these works; indeed,<br/>&gt;&gt; it is unlikely that he ever composed a treatise on music.</p><p>-----</p><p>&gt; Around 850 or so, writers start recording what might well represent a<br/>&gt; traditional style of polyphony based mainly on fifths and fourths,<br/>&gt; intervals favored in many world cultures: they speak of _organum_ or<br/>&gt; &quot;organized music,&quot; and write in a manner suggesting that this practice<br/>&gt; is already well known. While these stable intervals, plus octaves and<br/>&gt; elevenths (8:3) or twelfths (3:1), are central to the style, unstable<br/>&gt; intervals including major seconds or thirds appear now and then in<br/>&gt; certain examples involving oblique or contrary motion.</p><p>I think it&apos;s worth pointing out that until about 1000 or so,<br/>all the &quot;European&quot; treatises extant today were written from<br/>within the Frankish Kingdom proper, which formed the core of<br/>the &quot;Holy Roman Empire&quot; created when Charlemagne was crowned<br/>Emperor by the Pope on Christmas Day 800.</p><p>Around 1000 we begin to find treatises written in what is now<br/>Germany (Reichenau, at the very southern edge of Germany across<br/>the lake from Switzerland) and Italy -- by Hermannus Contractus<br/>and Guido, respectively, for examples -- which were by that time<br/>also parts of the &quot;Holy Roman Empire&quot;, but were later conquests by<br/>Charlemagne and thus not really inhabited by Franks.  I&apos;m of the<br/>opinion that these regional/demographic differences are in part<br/>responsible for the &quot;new&quot; ideas we see in these treatises.</p><p>Also, I&apos;ve speculated here before about the role the Vikings<br/>may have played in the evolution of European intonation.</p><p>(See my long post &lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/3380">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/3380</a>&gt;<br/>about halfway down, and Margo&apos;s partial corroboration of my ideas in<br/>Section 3 of her reply:<br/>&lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/3422">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/3422</a>&gt;.)</p><p>Note that during the period of heavy Viking raids, c. 800-1000<br/>(the early morning hours of midnight to 4 am in Margo&apos;s<br/>characterization), the Danes and Norwegians both plundered<br/>the coasts of France, Spain, and Italy, while the Swedes<br/>traveled thru western Russia and into the Caspian, Black,<br/>and Aegean Seas.</p><p>As far as actual Viking settlements go (as opposed to plundering raids):<br/>the Norwegians settled Greenland, Iceland, north and west Scotland<br/>(including the islands), east Ireland, and south Brittany (on the west<br/>coast of France); the Danes settled east England (the &quot;Danelaw&quot;) and<br/>south Sweden; the Norwegians and Danes together settled in Normandy<br/>(north coast of France); and the Swedes settled the entire east coast<br/>of the Baltic Sea and large areas of Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>There is mention of the terror of Viking raids in some of the Frankish<br/>music-theory treatises... the monastery of St Amand (in Flanders),<br/>where Hucbald lived, was destroyed in a Viking raid shortly<br/>after Hucbald died, IIRC.</p><p>Note also that almost immediately after the Viking raids died down,<br/>in the mid-900s, there were equally brutal raids into central and<br/>southern Europe by the Magyars.  It would not surprise me if Magyar<br/>infiltration left its mark on the music of these areas.</p><p>&gt; Interestingly, Richard Hoppin has offered an example of traditional<br/>&gt; Chinese polyphony where there is an interplay between vertical octaves<br/>&gt; at the opening or conclusion of phrases and parallel fourths in<br/>&gt; between, suggesting a possible kinship between various world<br/>&gt; traditions (whatever the &quot;explanations&quot;).</p><p>This type of &quot;polyphony&quot;, which is quite rare in European<br/>practice, is commonly known as &quot;heterophony&quot;.</p><p>I&apos;m unable to document it right now, but I find this type of<br/>heterophony in much popular music too, and have used it in<br/>some of my own pop songs... notably, between the guitar and bass<br/>near the beginning of my rock tune &quot;Happy Ending for the Devil&quot;<br/>&lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/songs/happyend.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/songs/happyend.htm</a>&gt;.</p><p>-----</p><p>&gt; During the 12th century (6 a.m.-8 a.m.), a style often especially<br/>&gt; favoring contrary motion while featuring all types of motions and<br/>&gt; intervals gets established in Western Europe -- but its exponents are<br/>&gt; by no means alone.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; At the same time, in Georgia, theorists are documenting three-voice<br/>&gt; singing, notably also based on fifths and fourths as the most favored<br/>&gt; concords, while featuring a variety of other intervals. By the end of<br/>&gt; the century, three-voice polyphony will also become the new and<br/>&gt; exciting trend in the West.</p><p>By 1227, Georgia had become part of the Empire of Genghis Khan.<br/>Presumably, to avoid the Mongolian invasion, there were many<br/>Georgians who escaped to the West, bringing their musical styles<br/>with them.</p><p>-----</p><p>&gt; While typical 14th-century styles nicely fit the standard system of<br/>&gt; Pythagorean intonation, one xenharmonicist deserves special mention:<br/>&gt; Marchettus (or Marchetto) of Padua.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Completed in 1318, his _Lucidarium_ may well call for use of cadential<br/>&gt; major thirds and sixths defining in effect new classes of intervals: a<br/>&gt; large major third at around 453 cents, or about midway between the<br/>&gt; usual Pythagorean major third and fourth; and a major sixth which he<br/>&gt; describes as equally distant from 3:2 fifth and 2:1 octave, or around<br/>&gt; 951 cents, about midway between usual major sixth and minor seventh.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; His special emphasis is on the principle of &quot;closest approach,&quot; in<br/>&gt; which thirds expanding to fifths or sixths to octaves should be<br/>&gt; &quot;colored&quot; or made major in order to make the resolution to a stable<br/>&gt; concord more efficient. While other theorists find the usual<br/>&gt; Pythagorean intervals ideal for this purpose, Marchettus appears to<br/>&gt; carry it yet further, advocating the use of a cadential semitone or<br/>&gt; &quot;diesis&quot; of possibly somewhere around 41-48 cents, in contrast to the<br/>&gt; usual Pythagorean diatonic semitone of 256:243 (~90 cents).</p><p>Margo is very familiar with my webpage on Marchetto, but others<br/>may not be: &lt;<a href="http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/marchet/marchet.htm">http://www.ixpres.com/interval/monzo/marchet/marchet.htm</a>&gt;.</p><p>In it, I offer two totally different interpretations of Marchetto&apos;s<br/>division of the whole-tone into 5 dieses, both of which differ from<br/>the interpretation preferred by Margo.</p><p>The later interpretation by me, which I think is probably incorrect<br/>(but it might not be!... one simply can&apos;t tell with Marchetto),<br/>gives a result very close to an extended Pythagorean system.  The<br/>earlier one, which I think is the most likely, gives a result<br/>approximating or implying something resembling 5-limit JI.</p><p>-----</p><p>&gt; In a typical Gothic style of the kind prevailing in Continental<br/>&gt; Europe, both the treatment of intervals and the qualities of<br/>&gt; Pythagorean tuning emphasize a contrast between stable fifths and<br/>&gt; fourths with pure ratios, and mildly unstable thirds with complex<br/>&gt; ratios.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By around 1500, however, the new Renaissance textures tend to flow<br/>&gt; smoothly between sonorities featuring thirds and sixths as the most<br/>&gt; favored intervals, and indeed the emerging standard of stable<br/>&gt; saturation. Here the concept of a &quot;smooth&quot; flow means not only the<br/>&gt; pervasive use of thirds and sixths, but the rather cautious and<br/>&gt; restricted use of seconds or sevenths -- in contrast to their more<br/>&gt; prominent role in Gothic styles.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; ...<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; While this trend seems to have taken root in some parts of Continental<br/>&gt; Europe by 1415, it may have been reinforced by an event of that year:<br/>&gt; an all-too-literal English invasion of France, contrasting in its<br/>&gt; martial violence to the gentler transoceanic incursion of the Beatles<br/>&gt; in 1964. The Battle of Agincourt not only inspired a famous carol, but<br/>&gt; may have the famous English composer John Dunstable to France along<br/>&gt; with the Duke of Bedford.</p><p>The post of mine which I cite above,<br/>&lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/3380">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tuning/message/3380</a>&gt;,<br/>has a lot of information on this, including extensive quotes<br/>from Hoppins&apos;s book.</p><p>Note also that ever since the Norman invasion of 1066, England<br/>and France had very close ties (the closeness varying at<br/>different times), with English kings often owning a great<br/>deal of land in France.</p><p>For a few centuries after Charlemagne&apos;s death, the &quot;kingdom&quot;<br/>of France regressed back to a feudal state, until the reigns<br/>of the strong kings Philip Augustus (1180-1223, during which<br/>Notre Dame was completed and the Universit&iuml;&iquest;&half; originated, around<br/>which Leonin, Perotin, and other early musical masters were<br/>centered), Louis IX (1226-70), and Philip the Fair (1285-1314).<br/>It was primarily thru the laws promulgated by the latter<br/>(which I would refer to as &quot;legal manipulations&quot;) that France<br/>once again became a real power in Europe.  I would say that<br/>thruout the 1200s Paris was the center of musical innovation<br/>in Europe.</p><p>I also noted with amusement Margo&apos;s reference here to the Beatles,<br/>because of their famous song &quot;A Day In The Life Of&quot;, whose odd<br/>title relates directly to the method used in Margo&apos;s post.</p><p>love / peace / harmony ...</p><p>-monz<br/><a href="http://www.monz.org">http://www.monz.org</a><br/>&quot;All roads lead to n^0&quot;</p><p>_________________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Get your free @... address at <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a></p></div>
