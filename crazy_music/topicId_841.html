If three<br/>or four civil and scholarly threads come out of your post, then<br/>thats fine (though I would tend to think they were more<br/>appropriate on the original tuning list).</p><p>Brian, I tend to agree with some of your (and your quotees)<br/>points regarding overly theorizing, especially when something<br/>is discussed as prescriptive theory. If people think they<br/>can skip lengthy ear-work on the way to making music, then they<br/>are mistaken. But that doesn&apos;t invalidate mind-work when it<br/>detects it can be used to help one expand what their is are<br/>enjoying.</p><p>At the beginning of this tuning list I related a story about<br/>a girl I knew who could only improvise at the piano in D dorian.<br/>She made pretty good music, although there was a little lack<br/>of variety after awhile. It was all D dorian music. Fine, there<br/>is no value judgement to be made.</p><p>Another musician may have benefitted from learning that the use<br/>of the black keys allowed other dorians to be played, and maybe<br/>those finger/sound constraints would provide some new melodic<br/>directions for her. Or that her same white keys could give her<br/>a G myxolydian, with a somewhat different vibe than the dorian.</p><p>We could refer to the person who trys to show her these things<br/>a member of the &quot;piano police&quot;, or a theory wanker, or<br/>whatever. And perhaps they would be if they immediately said<br/>&quot;no you can&apos;t do that because [famous composer and/or theory]<br/>says no&quot;. But if they try to show some of the other<br/>options/implications available, they may provide her a few<br/>landmarks that allow her to find something new to add to her<br/>music, or identify a path she doesn&apos;t want her music to take.</p><p>Informed choice. Yes, the choosing must be done with her ears.<br/>But the informing is however you can get someone to look at<br/>soething they might not see for some reason.</p><p>Lets both keep it civil and keep it real.</p><p>Bob Valentine</p></div><h3><a id=842 href="#842">ðŸ”—</a>John Starrett &#x3C;jstarret@...&#x3E;</h3><span>8/3/2001 8:18:28 AM</span><button style="float: right; margin-right: 20px">toggle monospace</button><div style='margin: 0px 20px 20px; padding: 20px; background-color: #eee'><p>Hi Brian. If you have some disagreement with Paul, Carl and JDL you<br/>should just come out and say so instead of beating around the bush.</p><p>I disagree with you on the utility of mathematics in microtonal music.<br/>Although I am not personally interested in lattice diagrams and other<br/>devices discussed in the tuning forum, I do think someone has to do<br/>this work in establishing mathematical structures that may have<br/>relevance to music. Yes, I am uninformed on the matter because the<br/>mathematics is not the sort I find fascinating (start talking Clifford<br/>Algebras, and I&apos;m there). These structures may or may not be relevant,<br/>but only experimental evidence will establish that. If any right<br/>conclusions can be drawn, there will need to be some sort of<br/>mathematical descriptions available to work with. These guys are doing<br/>(all differently) what they love, and that&apos;s OK with me.</p></div>
