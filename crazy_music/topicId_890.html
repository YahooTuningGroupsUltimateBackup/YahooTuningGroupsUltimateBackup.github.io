John Sankey is going to have you killed.</p><p>Quite possibly! ;-&gt;</p><p>&gt;&gt;   k051_12dr7: reduced to 12-tET, then tuned by JdL in 7-limit with<br/>&gt;&gt;      fairly rigid vertical springs and quite soft grounding springs,<br/>&gt;&gt;      allowing for quite a bit of drift of the tuning over time.</p><p>&gt;Oh yeah.</p><p>Kyool.  My concern here is that the piece _sounds_ good, yet because of<br/>rather large drift leaves an unsettled feeling.</p><p>&gt;&gt;   k051_12vvs7: reduced to 12-tET, then tuned by JdL in 7-limit with<br/>&gt;&gt;      extremely rigid vertical springs and normal grounding and<br/>&gt;&gt;      horizontal springs.</p><p>&gt;The second half contrasts so sharply with the nice purity of the first<br/>&gt;half, this is my least favorite.</p><p>Hmmm, not sure why it gives that sensation, but I&apos;m not crazy about<br/>this version either; it has rather large horizontal motion compared to<br/>the others.</p><p>&gt;Z7 is my favorite for the sheer preverse pleasure of hearing funny<br/>&gt;stuff. With a few hand tweaks, dr7 would no longer be funny, but a<br/>&gt;really interesting serious tuning choice. Truth is, if I had to choose<br/>&gt;one tuning (with which I am familiar) to hear this piece in for the<br/>&gt;rest of my life, I would choose Sankey&apos;s. Nevertheless is it great to<br/>&gt;hear these experiments.</p><p>Oh noooo!  Does this mean that Sankey doesn&apos;t have to kill me?  ;-&gt;</p><p>&gt;Yes, I would like to hear the five limit versions.</p><p>Here&apos;s my 5-limit COFT, compared to Sankey&apos;s fixed tuning, all cents<br/>relative to 12-teT:</p><p>            Sankey   COFT c5  COFT ce3<br/>            ------   -------  -------<br/>   G#/Ab    -12.50     +7.10   +12.44<br/>   D#/Eb     -8.62     +5.55    +7.29<br/>   A#/Bb     -5.08     +3.94    +3.20<br/>   F         -1.95     +3.33    +1.97<br/>   C          0.00     -0.34    -1.33<br/>   G         -3.17     -6.59    -6.01<br/>   D         -6.64     -8.24    -9.21<br/>   A        -11.33     -8.52    -7.86<br/>   E        -13.67     -3.57    -7.10<br/>   B        -13.50     -6.72    -6.42<br/>   F#/Gb    -15.26     +6.05    +1.92<br/>   C#/Db    -14.40     +8.00   +11.12</p><p>I have two COFT versions because of the infamous tritone.  The COFT c5<br/>uses 5-limit tuning files, and tends to target the 7th degree of a<br/>dominant 7th at 8/9 of root above.  The COFT ce3 doesn&apos;t use tuning<br/>files, and tends to target the 7th degree at 9/10 of root above.  Both<br/>COFT&apos;s are a kind of cross between meantone and well temperament; I have<br/>included files for both.</p><p>And a couple of others.  Go to the JdL directory of this group&apos;s files<br/>area and download <a href="http://k051b.zip">k051b.zip</a>.  As always, feedback welcome!</p><p>JdL</p></div>
